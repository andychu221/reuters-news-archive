      "Content": "KT-621 is a once-daily oral targeted protein degrader of STAT6 advancing toward Phase II for atopic dermatitis after Phase Ib showed deep target degradation, biomarker shifts (TARC, eotaxin, IgE, IL‑31, FeNO) and clinical signals in the \"dupilumab range\" at day 28, with the company reporting a \"clean\" safety profile and no treatment‑related adverse events to tabulate.\n\nKymera argues a large market opportunity—>100 million Type‑2 disease patients (40–50 million moderate‑to‑severe)—and says an oral, biologics‑like drug could boost uptake and potentially expand current ~$20–25B markets by 5x–10x, especially by improving convenience and enabling earlier/pediatric use.\n\nThe company is also advancing an IRF5 degrader, KT‑579 , and continues to deploy its Pegasus™ targeted‑degradation platform to pursue genetically validated, previously undruggable immune targets.\n\nInterested in Kymera Therapeutics, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nInsider Buying: Smart Money Just Spent +$100M on These 3 Stocks\n\nKymera Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KYMR) used a fireside chat at the Guggenheim Conference to outline its focus on targeted protein degradation in immunology, with CEO Nello Mainolfi emphasizing the company’s goal of delivering “biologics-like activity” in a once-daily oral drug.\n\nMainolfi described Kymera as founded on the promise of targeted protein degradation, which he said can enable the company to pursue targets that have not been successfully drugged before. He said Kymera has chosen to focus on immunology and believes it can show that “if you go after the right target in the right pathway,” an oral medicine can deliver activity comparable to injectable biologics.\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nAnalysts Can't Get Enough of These Little-Known Biopharma Stocks\n\nAsked about how to think about Kymera’s valuation in the context of advancing KT-621 into Phase II for atopic dermatitis (AD), Mainolfi argued the opportunity should be viewed beyond AD alone and framed KT-621 as a “Type 2” drug relevant across multiple Type 2 inflammatory diseases.\n\nHe cited a broad patient population, saying there are more than 100 million Type 2 disease patients, and estimated 40 million to 50 million moderate-to-severe patients as the initial development population. Mainolfi characterized several of the markets as “very immature,” noting that many have one or two drugs and often lack an effective oral option. He said penetration of advanced systemic therapy is roughly 1 million to 2 million patients relative to the broader moderate-to-severe population he described.\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nMainolfi said current annual sales of drugs in these spaces are around $20 billion to $25 billion and argued the market could expand “dramatically,” potentially by 5x to 10x, across areas such as AD, asthma, COPD, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). He said oral drugs with biologics-like efficacy could drive significant market expansion and added that STAT6 sits in what he called the “most validated pathway” in Type 2 diseases for both efficacy and safety.\n\nDiscussing what patients and prescribers want from new therapies, Mainolfi said feedback from investigators and key opinion leaders consistently points to demand for oral drugs. He described a psychological barrier associated with injections and suggested convenience can influence adherence over time.\n\n→ Cloudflare: Another AI-Disrupted Stock You Might Want to Buy\n\nHe also said that a meaningful portion of patients discontinue biologics after a couple of years, attributing that to the ongoing burden of injections and planning. Mainolfi highlighted pediatric patients as an underserved group and said earlier intervention could potentially alter disease progression, referencing the “atopic march.” He argued that only an oral drug could be used early enough for very young children.\n\nMainolfi addressed questions about the company’s characterization of KT-621’s safety profile as “clean” without presenting granular adverse event tables in the update. He said Kymera’s practice has been to share treatment-related adverse events tables, but in the referenced study there were no treatment-related adverse events to tabulate. He said the company is preparing a publication and may provide additional detail, including non-treatment-related adverse events, which he described as benign.\n\nOn chronic toxicology studies, Mainolfi said the company expects to provide an update “soon,” adding that Kymera has recently said it is in the completion phase of that process.\n\nTurning to efficacy, Mainolfi emphasized the breadth of the Phase Ib dataset and Kymera’s focus on linking target degradation to biomarker changes and then to clinical endpoints. He said deep degradation of the target was associated with changes across multiple biomarkers measured in AD patients, including:\n\nTARC\n\nEotaxin\n\nIgE\n\nIL-31 (blood)\n\nFeNO (to assess Type 2 inflammation in the lungs)\n\nHe said those biomarker shifts corresponded with changes in clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including itch, EASI, SCORAD, sleeplessness, and other measures. He also referenced asthma-related measures collected in comorbid patients, including FeNO and the ACQ-5 questionnaire.\n\nMainolfi said the results were consistent with Kymera’s initial guidance, which he described as being in the “dupilumab range” at day 28, while adding that the numbers were numerically better than dupilumab data in the early study but should not be interpreted as proving superiority. He also said the internal consistency across endpoints made it, in his view, “completely shocking” if the drug failed to show a strong effect in a Phase IIb study.\n\nOn duration of effect, Mainolfi said he does not believe KT-621’s AD effect had plateaued at four weeks, pointing to the shape of the improvement curves from day 7 through day 28 and noting that drugs targeting IL-4/IL-13 pathways generally do not plateau by day 28. Asked how much better it could get, he said he expects it to be better than dupilumab-like efficacy at day 28.\n\nMainolfi said cross-trial comparisons in AD are challenging due to differences in baseline severity and other factors. He noted that baseline EASI in historical dupilumab studies was around 30, while more recent trials often fall in the mid-20s, which he said can be associated with higher placebo responses. He suggested treatment effect remains important to evaluate, and said categorical endpoints such as vIGA 0/1 and EASI-75 may be more useful for looking across trials because placebo rates tend to be lower.\n\nHe emphasized that the primary goal of Kymera’s Phase II study is dose selection for Phase III, assuming efficacy and safety are established.\n\nOn asthma, Mainolfi described FeNO as an established biomarker of Type 2 inflammation used in some settings to guide therapy. He said reductions in FeNO indicate reduced Type 2 lung inflammation, and framed the Phase Ib FeNO changes as evidence the drug is reaching the lungs and degrading STAT6 locally. He said the combination of FeNO and ACQ-5 results increased his confidence that KT-621 should be active in asthma, and added that preclinical studies show strong performance in asthma models and that the drug distributes well in lungs.\n\nIn addition to STAT6, Mainolfi discussed Kymera’s IRF5 program KT-579, saying IRF5 has genetic validation through functional variants in disease patients. He said IRF5 expression is limited to certain cell types—such as NK cells, macrophages, monocytes, and B cells—and that healthy volunteer studies can help establish whether KT-579 achieves the level of degradation Kymera is targeting and whether that translates into expected biological effects in ex vivo stimulation assays, including impacts on cytokines, Type 1 interferon, and IgG.\n\nKymera Therapeutics, Inc is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small‐molecule therapies that harness the body's natural protein homeostasis pathways. Since its founding in 2016, Kymera has pursued a targeted protein degradation platform designed to identify and selectively eliminate disease‐causing proteins. The company's proprietary Pegasus™ platform integrates insights from ubiquitin biology and medicinal chemistry to advance novel degrader candidates across a range of therapeutic areas.\n\nThe company's pipeline emphasizes immunology and oncology.\n\nThe article \" Kymera Therapeutics Touts Once-Daily Oral “Biologics-Like” KT-621 at Guggenheim Conference \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "The software sector is experiencing its worst market sell-off since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, but this time the trigger is not a banking collapse, it is artificial intelligence.\n\nThe US sector fell 14.5% in January, its worst monthly performance since October 2008. The sell-off accelerated in early February, with a further 10% decline in less than two weeks.\n\nAt the heart of the rout is a growing investor concern. Many fear that AI tools may not simply enhance existing software products, but erode parts of the subscription-based business models that have underpinned the sector’s growth for more than a decade.\n\nIn the United States, some of the sector’s former high-flyers have seen dramatic reversals.\n\nUnity Software, which provides tools for video game developers, cybersecurity group Rapid7, and customer engagement platform Braze have each lost more than half their market value since the start of the year.\n\nEven the giants have not been spared. Palantir, long considered an AI bellwether, alongside enterprise stalwarts Salesforce, Intuit, and ServiceNow, have fallen by around 30% year-to-date.\n\nOne of the key triggers for the sector’s sell-off was Anthropic’s unveiling of new enterprise plugins for its Claude AI assistant in January.\n\nThe announcement suddenly pushed investors to ask an uncomfortable question: if AI can do what these software platforms do, why do we need the platforms at all?\n\nRelated\n\nIs the AI bubble about to burst, and what's driving analyst jitters?\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek rattles global markets as Nvidia shares plunge\n\nEurope’s broader software sector is valued at roughly €300bn and is heavily concentrated in a handful of companies.\n\nThat concentration makes every percentage drop more visible — and more painful.\n\nGermany’s flagship technology group SAP is by far the largest European software company with a market capitalisation of around €200bn.\n\nShares in SAP have already fallen roughly 20% year-to-date and by 40% since its peak in February 2025.\n\nIn terms of market value, SAP has wiped out €188bn over the past year alone, nearly half of its current capitalisation.\n\nEven more worrying than the number is the trend: SAP is heading for its ninth straight month of decline. That's never happened in over 30 years of trading.\n\nFor a company long seen as a pillar of European tech resilience, the symbolism is stark.\n\nFrance’s Dassault Systèmes, known for 3D design and engineering platforms used in aerospace and manufacturing, ranks second among Europe’s listed software groups, with a market capitalisation of around €24bn.\n\nIts shares have fallen approximately 25% since the start of the year and are heading for a fifth consecutive month of declines — the longest losing streak since 2016.\n\nIn third place sits Sage Group. The British accounting software provider has dropped about 25% year-to-date, including a 17% slide in February alone, putting the stock on course for its weakest monthly performance since July 2002.\n\nBritish information and analytics group RELX suffered a sharp 17% single-session drop earlier this month — its steepest daily decline since 1988 — and is now on course for what could become its worst month on record.\n\nIf Europe’s software heavyweights are under pressure, mid-sized firms are feeling the strain even more acutely.\n\nSmaller companies tend to have narrower client bases and less diversified revenue streams, meaning shifts in investor sentiment can translate into sharper share price swings.\n\nFrance’s Sidetrade, which uses artificial intelligence to help companies manage order-to-cash processes, has fallen nearly 50% since the start of the year — making it the hardest-hit name in the European software space.\n\nSweden’s Lime Technologies, a CRM provider focused on the Nordic region, is down almost 38%, while Denmark’s cBrain, known for its digital platforms used by public administrations, has lost roughly 35%.\n\nNorway’s LINK Mobility Group, which provides communications and messaging platforms for businesses, and SmartCraft, delivering cloud-based tools to the construction industry, have each dropped by around 32%.\n\nFrench group 74Software, specialising in API management and digital finance integration, has recorded a similarly steep decline.\n\nThe debate among experts reflects the market’s uncertainty.\n\nJensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has dismissed the idea that AI will replace software as “the most illogical thing in the world,” arguing that AI will enhance existing systems rather than eliminate them.\n\nWedbush Securities said markets are pricing in “an Armageddon scenario” that appears disconnected from corporate reality, noting that companies will not rip out software infrastructure overnight.\n\nJP Morgan strategists have similarly suggested that investors are discounting worst-case disruption scenarios that are unlikely to materialise in the near term.\n\nVeteran Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni said markets have swung from “AI-phoria to AI-phobia”, indicating that while industry valuations now appear more compelling, earnings expectations may not yet fully reflect the potential slowdown facing software companies.\n\nYet others urge caution. Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider has warned of “long-term downside risk”, drawing parallels with industries such as newspapers and tobacco that underestimated structural change.\n\nThe expert highlighted a fundamental market rotation, with investors rapidly exiting AI-exposed software stocks and reallocating capital towards cyclical and value-oriented sectors more closely tied to the “real economy”.\n\nThe central question is whether this marks a necessary repricing of a sector that had benefitted from years of elevated valuations — or the early stages of a more structural reset driven by AI.\n\nFor investors, the current sell-off goes beyond quarterly earnings or interest rate expectations. It reflects a deeper uncertainty about how value will be created and captured in an AI-driven economy.\n\nIf AI tools reduce the need for multiple layers of enterprise software, margins, and pricing power could come under pressure.\n\nIf, instead, AI enhances productivity within existing platforms, today’s correction may prove excessive.\n\nHistory suggests technology transitions rarely eliminate entire sectors.

      "Content": "CANTERBURY-BANKSTOWN, Australia , Feb. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Introduction\n\nIn 2025, Australia's home battery storage sector has seen explosive growth. Since July, the federal Cheaper Home Batteries Program has driven the installation of around 100,000 household battery systems, delivering over 2 GWh of storage capacity in under four months. This surge has been fueled by a government-backed discount of around 30% on upfront costs and strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, data from the Clean Energy Regulator shows that validated installations through August 2025 have already reached 43,517 units, amounting to approximately 825 MWh of capacity.\n\nAs one of the promising renewable energy markets in the world, Australia continues to lead in residential solar adoption. Felicitysolar has long followed the development of Australia's solar and battery storage market, closely tracking regulatory standards, certification requirements, and evolving installer needs. The current wave of growth marks a new phase of opportunity for local distributors and installation partners, as residential energy storage becomes increasingly mainstream across the country.\n\nKey Factors Installers and Distributors Consider\n\nInstallers and distributors are the crucial link between products and the end market. Based on Felicitysolar's long-term cooperation with partners across different regions, it has been observed that when selecting a solar energy storage brand, installers and distributors typically evaluate several key factors that directly impact system reliability, long-term cooperation, and sustainable business growth.\n\nBeyond product performance itself, considerations such as certification compliance, local technical support, supply stability, and after-sales responsiveness often play a decisive role in supplier selection. As the Australian market enters a new stage of rapid battery adoption, these factors are becoming increasingly critical for partners seeking stable and scalable growth.\n\n1. Profitability\n\nProducts should be reasonably priced, allowing distributors and installers sufficient margin to maintain healthy business operations.\n\n2. Product Reliability\n\nSystems must deliver consistent performance with low failure rates and demonstrate the ability to adapt to local conditions, including harsh environments. In addition to reliability, certification compliance is a critical consideration in the Australian market.\n\nFelicitysolar's inverters and lithium battery packs are certified in accordance with relevant Australian requirements. The LUX-X-48100LG01-US lithium battery is listed on the CEC approved battery list, while the T-REX-10KLP3G01 hybrid inverter has passed the AS4777-2:2020 standard, meeting local grid connection compliance requirements for solar inverters in Australia.\n\n3. R&D Capabilities and Long-Term Innovation\n\nStrong research and development capabilities are often a decisive factor. Installers and distributors need confidence that the products they represent are not only reliable today, but also continuously evolving to meet future market demands.\n\nTo strengthen this foundation, Felicitysolar has launched a new PV and energy storage R&D and manufacturing base. This new base is not simply an expansion of manufacturing capacity, but a forward-looking investment designed to reinforce R&D capabilities, accelerate product upgrades and innovation, and enhance overall product consistency and quality control.\n\nFor partners, this means access to more stable supply, improved system compatibility, faster technology iteration, and solar energy solutions that are increasingly aligned with real-world installation needs.\n\n4. After-Sales Support and Service Commitment\n\nBeyond product performance, long-term cooperation depends heavily on service reliability. Comprehensive technical training, installation guidance, and responsive after-sales support are critical for ensuring smooth project delivery and maintaining end-customer satisfaction.\n\nRecognizing this, Felicitysolar has placed greater emphasis on service alongside product development. As the company steps into 2026, it has officially designated the year as its \"Year of Service.\" This initiative focuses on:\n\nFaster and more efficient delivery\n\nStrengthened pre- and post-sales support\n\nOngoing technical assistance\n\nMarketing guidance for local partners\n\nFor installers and distributors, this service-oriented strategy helps reduce operational pressure, improve project efficiency, and build stronger long-term trust with customers in their local markets.\n\nThese factors guide distributors and installers in evaluating different brands, complementing considerations such as system type (off-grid, hybrid, all-in-one), output configuration, and applications. Felicitysolar's solutions are designed to meet these requirements, offering reliable performance, competitive pricing, and strong local support networks.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolar energy storage systems are becoming increasingly common in residential and commercial projects. Providers offer a range of solutions, including off-grid, hybrid, all-in-one, and battery-focused systems. Key factors such as product reliability, service and support networks, supported output configurations, and typical applications differ between brands.\n\nBy carefully considering these aspects, installers and distributors can select the most suitable solutions for their customers, ensuring compatibility with local grid conditions, meeting performance expectations, and providing peace of mind through reliable after-sales support.\n\nContact:\naustralian@felicitysolar.com\nhttps://www.felicitysolar.com.au\n\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/felicitysolar-insights-on-how-australian-installers-evaluate-home-energy-storage-suppliers-302688205.html",

      "Content": "Miami Metal Make a Statement in the Inaugural Season's Second Match\n\nATLANTA , Feb. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- The Pro Cheer League electrified Atlanta with the second match of its inaugural season, showcasing each team's elite athleticism and precision in front of the league's first sold out crowd. After a successful season opener in Indianapolis watched by more than 1.6M viewers on ION, each team raised their game and tried to tighten the standings at the midway point of the season. Ultimately, the Miami Metal showed their narrow season-opening win wasn't a fluke, coming away with a dominant win with 15/16 possible points. The win secured another $15,000 in prize money and even more momentum into the season's second half.\n\n\"We have been wondering for almost a month how our teams were going to prepare and turn it up a notch after our first match and they did not disappoint tonight,\" said John Newby, Commissioner of the Pro Cheer League. \"Congratulations to Miami and a huge shoutout to the incredible fans in Atlanta who bought into our theme of 'All The Love' with a wild atmosphere in a sold-out arena. We can't wait to turn it up even further in Houston and start the second half of our season with a bang.\"\n\nEven with Miami taking the first two rounds, the competition behind them was fierce, with a budding rivalry with Dallas taking shape in several head-to-head matchups throughout the night. Atlanta and Golden State were determined not to cede the spotlight with several incredible moments and a loud hometown crowd eager to make noise.\n\nQuarter One\n\nThe match began with the Atlanta Air soaring in front of their hometown crowd before the Miami Metal brought the house down with a revamped routine featuring a brand-new, never-before-seen shooting star move completed by Josh Hill and Hailey D'Lynn Smith.\n\nAfter losing the first round in a close decision in Indianapolis, Coach Jose Gonzalez admitted the Metal were motivated to beat Dallas this time and take the round.\n\nDallas finished second, followed by Atlanta and then Golden State.\n\nAfter completing their prepared routines, the athletes moved into the \"gauntlet\" portion of the match, taking on a series of specialized head-to-head events that determined seeding and points available in each round. Each round opens with a quick competition where the winning teams advance to select a new game to determine the overall winner of the round. The losing teams face off in a second event to determine third and fourth place.\n\nQuarter Two\n\nThe second quarter opened with Dallas and Miami facing off in the Coed Endurance game, which is where each team's strongest athlete takes on the challenge of completing as many popovers as possible in 45 seconds without dropping. This requires an individual to keep their teammate in the air while quickly switching their feet between their left and right hands. Miami's Kollin Cockrell, an experienced 12-time world-cheer champion and Olympic weightlifter, immediately showed his strength by nearly doubling the league record with 52 popovers, stunning the crowd.\n\nMiami advanced to face Golden State in Hangtime, where both teams had one toe touch basket toss to see who could send their flyer highest into the air. It was a close toss, but Miami's Julia Romero won a close call and took control of the match.\n\nIn the other bracket, Dallas and Atlanta competed in All Girl Big Trick where Atlanta showcased impeccable all-girl stunt skills completing a double back twist layout dismount to take the decision. This was later awarded the Performance of the Night during the broadcast.\n\nQuarter Three\n\nEven with Miami taking control, there was no quit or let up across all four teams. The seeding was determined by Last Pass, where four athletes from each team showcase their tumbling skills. Three of the tumblers perform a synchronized pass across the mat before a solo pass from a fourth athlete.\n\nAtlanta took on Miami first and quickly created a controversial moment. Dee Joseph, who already wowed crowds in this event in the season opener, built on his previous triple by completing a quadruple full. While the crowd went wild, it was revealed that the move was illegal according to the official league rules, setting off a chorus of boos. Miami's Skylar Graves performed a complicated one and a half, punch front to double back tuck.\n\n\"Those were record-breaking phenomenal skills we don't ever see in college or ICU,\" said Judge Vontae Johnson before revealing the decision.\n\nNext, Dallas secured a win over Golden State, advancing to another showdown with Miami in the Hangtime event. Both teams soared well above the stage rafters before Dallas was awarded the round, winning the only point Miami would ultimately fail to secure.\n\nAtlanta and Golden State then competed in the All Girl Endurance event, where the Air showed why they are known for their all-girl stunting supremacy with 26 tick tocks.\n\nMiami had another win between quarters when they were recognized as the fan favorite vote winner, securing the most live votes and the league's first title belt in a new fan feature during the competition.\n\nRound Four\n\nThe final round opened with Flash Pyramid, a best-of-five game where each team scrambles to see who can first build a cheer pyramid. The first team to build their pyramids faster three times wins the matchup. Miami came out quick over Golden State before Dallas did the same against Atlanta, leading them into a final competition in the Coed Big Trick Event with a chance to make a final statement before the end of the night.\n\nMiami won a close judges' decision thanks to a wider variation of elements incorporated into their performance. When asked if they are the team to beat, Coach Gonzales smiled and said \"right now we are,\" setting the tone as their budding rivalry moves to Houston.\n\nElsewhere in the quarter, Atlanta and Golden State showcased their skills in Bullseye, another fan favorite from the season opener. Two overtime rounds were needed before Corey Pullen landed close to an almost perfect bullseye, memorably securing third place for the hometown favorites and giving their fans another chance to chant together for the ATL.\n\nThe next match will be live in Houston on Friday, February 27, at 8 p.m. ET.

      "Content": "Miami Metal Make a Statement in the Inaugural Season's Second Match\n\nATLANTA , Feb. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- The Pro Cheer League electrified Atlanta with the second match of its inaugural season, showcasing each team's elite athleticism and precision in front of the league's first sold out crowd. After a successful season opener in Indianapolis watched by more than 1.6M viewers on ION, each team raised their game and tried to tighten the standings at the midway point of the season. Ultimately, the Miami Metal showed their narrow season-opening win wasn't a fluke, coming away with a dominant win with 15/16 possible points. The win secured another $15,000 in prize money and even more momentum into the season's second half.\n\n\"We have been wondering for almost a month how our teams were going to prepare and turn it up a notch after our first match and they did not disappoint tonight,\" said John Newby, Commissioner of the Pro Cheer League. \"Congratulations to Miami and a huge shoutout to the incredible fans in Atlanta who bought into our theme of 'All The Love' with a wild atmosphere in a sold-out arena. We can't wait to turn it up even further in Houston and start the second half of our season with a bang.\"\n\nEven with Miami taking the first two rounds, the competition behind them was fierce, with a budding rivalry with Dallas taking shape in several head-to-head matchups throughout the night. Atlanta and Golden State were determined not to cede the spotlight with several incredible moments and a loud hometown crowd eager to make noise.\n\nQuarter One\n\nThe match began with the Atlanta Air soaring in front of their hometown crowd before the Miami Metal brought the house down with a revamped routine featuring a brand-new, never-before-seen shooting star move completed by Josh Hill and Hailey D'Lynn Smith.\n\nAfter losing the first round in a close decision in Indianapolis, Coach Jose Gonzalez admitted the Metal were motivated to beat Dallas this time and take the round.\n\nDallas finished second, followed by Atlanta and then Golden State.\n\nAfter completing their prepared routines, the athletes moved into the \"gauntlet\" portion of the match, taking on a series of specialized head-to-head events that determined seeding and points available in each round. Each round opens with a quick competition where the winning teams advance to select a new game to determine the overall winner of the round. The losing teams face off in a second event to determine third and fourth place.\n\nQuarter Two\n\nThe second quarter opened with Dallas and Miami facing off in the Coed Endurance game, which is where each team's strongest athlete takes on the challenge of completing as many popovers as possible in 45 seconds without dropping. This requires an individual to keep their teammate in the air while quickly switching their feet between their left and right hands. Miami's Kollin Cockrell, an experienced 12-time world-cheer champion and Olympic weightlifter, immediately showed his strength by nearly doubling the league record with 52 popovers, stunning the crowd.\n\nMiami advanced to face Golden State in Hangtime, where both teams had one toe touch basket toss to see who could send their flyer highest into the air. It was a close toss, but Miami's Julia Romero won a close call and took control of the match.\n\nIn the other bracket, Dallas and Atlanta competed in All Girl Big Trick where Atlanta showcased impeccable all-girl stunt skills completing a double back twist layout dismount to take the decision. This was later awarded the Performance of the Night during the broadcast.\n\nQuarter Three\n\nEven with Miami taking control, there was no quit or let up across all four teams. The seeding was determined by Last Pass, where four athletes from each team showcase their tumbling skills. Three of the tumblers perform a synchronized pass across the mat before a solo pass from a fourth athlete.\n\nAtlanta took on Miami first and quickly created a controversial moment. Dee Joseph, who already wowed crowds in this event in the season opener, built on his previous triple by completing a quadruple full. While the crowd went wild, it was revealed that the move was illegal according to the official league rules, setting off a chorus of boos. Miami's Skylar Graves performed a complicated one and a half, punch front to double back tuck.\n\n\"Those were record-breaking phenomenal skills we don't ever see in college or ICU,\" said Judge Vontae Johnson before revealing the decision.\n\nNext, Dallas secured a win over Golden State, advancing to another showdown with Miami in the Hangtime event. Both teams soared well above the stage rafters before Dallas was awarded the round, winning the only point Miami would ultimately fail to secure.\n\nAtlanta and Golden State then competed in the All Girl Endurance event, where the Air showed why they are known for their all-girl stunting supremacy with 26 tick tocks.\n\nMiami had another win between quarters when they were recognized as the fan favorite vote winner, securing the most live votes and the league's first title belt in a new fan feature during the competition.\n\nRound Four\n\nThe final round opened with Flash Pyramid, a best-of-five game where each team scrambles to see who can first build a cheer pyramid. The first team to build their pyramids faster three times wins the matchup. Miami came out quick over Golden State before Dallas did the same against Atlanta, leading them into a final competition in the Coed Big Trick Event with a chance to make a final statement before the end of the night.\n\nMiami won a close judges' decision thanks to a wider variation of elements incorporated into their performance. When asked if they are the team to beat, Coach Gonzales smiled and said \"right now we are,\" setting the tone as their budding rivalry moves to Houston.\n\nElsewhere in the quarter, Atlanta and Golden State showcased their skills in Bullseye, another fan favorite from the season opener. Two overtime rounds were needed before Corey Pullen landed close to an almost perfect bullseye, memorably securing third place for the hometown favorites and giving their fans another chance to chant together for the ATL.\n\nThe next match will be live in Houston on Friday, February 27, at 8 p.m. ET. Ticket information and how to watch live over the air or via streaming services on ION is available at procheerleague.com .\n\nReplays of the match will air periodically on ION and are available on demand through Varsity TV.\n\nVideo and image assets from the league and each match are available here .

If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nWe're all so busy, so we especially love products that are easy and convenient. As you’re preparing for spring cleaning, you can save yourself time as you’re giving your bedroom a refresh with a new bedding set. Luckily for you, we found a limited-time deal on a 7-piece bedding set – sheets, comforter, pillowcases – everything you need to refresh your bed, all in one simple package. With this sale, you'll get everything you need for a spring reset for your bed for less than $4 a piece.\n\nThe Velorose 7-Piece Bedding Set is just $26 right now at Amazon, down 32% from its regular price of $39. Shop before this limited-time deal ends to get your new sheets and comforter at an amazingly affordable price. If you’re looking for another reason to add this set to your cart besides its affordable price tag, it’s important to note that it has fewer returns than similar items and customers usually keep it.\n\nThis set includes everything you need for a beautiful, color-coordinated bed. Say goodbye to mismatched bedding when you upgrade to this matching set. The best sale price of $26 for a queen set is the black bedding, for a classic dark look, but you can also get it in a few other colors if you don't mind spending a few dollars more. It's also available in beige, dark gray, navy, Emerald Green, pink, red, and white. And if you're shopping for multiple beds in the house, the manufacturer also has this set in other mattress sizes, including twin, twin XL , full, and king – just make sure to check for color availability and know that the pricing varies, yet many other options also have a deal offer right now.\n\nShoppers love the thickness of the comforter, saying it keeps them warm without being too hot, making it perfect to use all year round. One shopper called it a \"Soft, stylish queen bed-in-a-bag set that works year-round.\" They continued, \"The fabric feels soft and breathable, and the comforter has a nice balance of warmth without feeling too heavy, making it comfortable for all seasons. It doesn’t make noise when moving around at night, which is a small detail but definitely appreciated.\" Many other shoppers agree that it is so soft, with one saying it is \"soft and fluffy\" and others noting that it is very comfortable.\n\nMany other shoppers note that the corners of the fitted sheet don't fall off during the night while you move around. It's designed with deep pockets to fix mattresses from 10 to 14 inches thick. One shopper said, \"It is so soft, and the fitted sheet went on so smoothly. It didn’t slip or slide and remained taut in place. Great value.\"\n\nRelated: Ikea's new cottagecore duvet set is just $25\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning, this set is machine washable for easy care. The manufacturer recommends washing it separately. You simply run it on the gentle cycle using cold water. To dry, tumble on low heat.\n\nMaterial: 100% polyester.\n\nCare: Machine wash.\n\nSet includes: Comforter, flat sheet, fitted sheet, two pillowcases, and two pillow shams.\n\nThis set ships in a vacuum-sealed bag, so when you first get it, you'll need to fluff it back out. The manufacturer recommends either throwing it in your dryer on low heat or air drying it in the sun and then gently tapping it to get it back to its perfect shape and fluffiness.\n\nJollyvogue 2-Pack Queen Pillows, $17 (was $28) at Amazon\n\nUtopia Bedding 2-Pack Down Alternative Pillows, $23 (was $30) at Amazon\n\nOsbed 2-Pack Cooling Adjustable Pillows, $39 (was $47) at Amazon\n\nThis great deal on a complete bedding set won’t last forever, so pick up the Velorose 7-Piece Bedding Set while it's available at the low, affordable price of just $26 at Amazon for a limited time.\n\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 14, 2026, where it first appeared in the Deals section.

      "Content": "There have only been four companies to reach a $3 trillion market cap or greater. But as the stock market rises, the $3 trillion level will eventually be breached by many more companies. In fact, I think three of them will each reach that level over the next three years.\n\nThe three that I've got my eye on are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . All of these companies are within striking distance, and each looks like a worthy investment option now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nSome of these companies have further to go than others. Amazon is already a $2.4 trillion company, so projecting that it will rise to a market cap of $3 trillion in three years isn't really that bold a call. It only needs to manage a growth rate of 8% over the next three years to get there. If that's all, the faster it grows, the more likely it will be a disappointment for most investors. I think Amazon has a much better growth case than that, but we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom have much further to go. Taiwan Semiconductor is a $1.72 trillion company, while Broadcom tops the sales at $1.47 trillion. It will take a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% and 27%, respectively, for each to rise to a $3 trillion cap three years from now.\n\nThat's no easy task, but if each can deliver that rate of return, they will make for no-brainer buys right now. But are these growth rates feasible?\n\nAmazon is probably the easiest company to make a case for. Although it only needs to deliver an 8% growth rate to reach this level, it has managed to grow its revenue above double digits for the past four years.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nI have no doubt that it will continue that trend over the next few years, and it could grow at an even faster rate thanks to the acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing service that powers traditional and AI workloads, posted revenue growth of 24% in the fourth quarter (Q4) -- the best in 13 quarters. This is a clear sign that Amazon's business is thriving, and with AWS having a much better operating margin than the rest of the business, its outsized growth will have an even greater effect on profits. Amazon is a lock to reach a $3 trillion market cap in three years and should beat the market along the way.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key part of the AI build-out, as its chip foundries manufacture a large chunk of the logic chips utilized in AI devices. Management expects huge growth from AI over the next few years, with AI chip revenue rising at nearly a 60% CAGR. However, that's not a companywide growth rate, as other companies utilize its foundry services outside of AI. From 2024 to 2029, management expects a CAGR of nearly 25% companywide, easily surpassing the 20% return threshold needed to rise to a $3 trillion company three years from now.\n\nLast is Broadcom. It has the longest way to go but will likely grow at the fastest rate. Although it does several other things, its biggest growth driver is its custom AI chips, which it designs in a partnership with AI hyperscalers. By designing a chip around a specific workload, Broadcom can achieve better results at a lower price point but at the cost of flexibility. These are massively growing in popularity, and Broadcom expects to double its AI segment revenue year over year during Q1 2026. As more hyperscalers launch their custom chip design with Broadcom, their growth rate will continue to be strong. This will drive Broadcom to become a $3 trillion company quickly, and investors shouldn't miss out on this stock .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

All of these companies are within striking distance, and each looks like a worthy investment option now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nSome of these companies have further to go than others. Amazon is already a $2.4 trillion company, so projecting that it will rise to a market cap of $3 trillion in three years isn't really that bold a call. It only needs to manage a growth rate of 8% over the next three years to get there. If that's all, the faster it grows, the more likely it will be a disappointment for most investors. I think Amazon has a much better growth case than that, but we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom have much further to go. Taiwan Semiconductor is a $1.72 trillion company, while Broadcom tops the sales at $1.47 trillion. It will take a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% and 27%, respectively, for each to rise to a $3 trillion cap three years from now.\n\nThat's no easy task, but if each can deliver that rate of return, they will make for no-brainer buys right now. But are these growth rates feasible?\n\nAmazon is probably the easiest company to make a case for. Although it only needs to deliver an 8% growth rate to reach this level, it has managed to grow its revenue above double digits for the past four years.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nI have no doubt that it will continue that trend over the next few years, and it could grow at an even faster rate thanks to the acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing service that powers traditional and AI workloads, posted revenue growth of 24% in the fourth quarter (Q4) -- the best in 13 quarters. This is a clear sign that Amazon's business is thriving, and with AWS having a much better operating margin than the rest of the business, its outsized growth will have an even greater effect on profits. Amazon is a lock to reach a $3 trillion market cap in three years and should beat the market along the way.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key part of the AI build-out, as its chip foundries manufacture a large chunk of the logic chips utilized in AI devices. Management expects huge growth from AI over the next few years, with AI chip revenue rising at nearly a 60% CAGR. However, that's not a companywide growth rate, as other companies utilize its foundry services outside of AI. From 2024 to 2029, management expects a CAGR of nearly 25% companywide, easily surpassing the 20% return threshold needed to rise to a $3 trillion company three years from now.\n\nLast is Broadcom. It has the longest way to go but will likely grow at the fastest rate. Although it does several other things, its biggest growth driver is its custom AI chips, which it designs in a partnership with AI hyperscalers. By designing a chip around a specific workload, Broadcom can achieve better results at a lower price point but at the cost of flexibility. These are massively growing in popularity, and Broadcom expects to double its AI segment revenue year over year during Q1 2026. As more hyperscalers launch their custom chip design with Broadcom, their growth rate will continue to be strong.

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\n\nBirkenstock Holding (BIRK) has put its latest quarter in focus after reporting double digit revenue growth, driven by holiday demand, broader product reach, and new store openings, while keeping full year 2026 guidance unchanged.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Birkenstock Holding.\n\nDespite the strong first quarter update and confirmed 2026 guidance, Birkenstock Holding’s short term momentum has been mixed, with a 3.5% 7 day share price return alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of about 28% decline. This suggests recent optimism sits against a weaker first year for investors.\n\nIf this earnings story has you thinking about where else growth might be emerging, take a look at our screener of 23 top founder-led companies as potential next ideas to research.\n\nWith analyst targets sitting well above the current US$39.80 share price and the stock still carrying a value score of 5, the key question is whether this gap signals opportunity or if the market already reflects future growth.\n\nThe most followed narrative puts Birkenstock Holding’s fair value at $45.35, comfortably above the last close of $39.80, which is framing the current debate.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\n\nWant to see how this tension between strong demand and capacity limits shapes the fair value?

The exact mix of those assumptions is where the story gets interesting.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $45.35 (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\n\nHowever, if capacity expansions ease supply bottlenecks and investments in owned stores continue to improve efficiency, revenue and margins could surprise on the upside and challenge this cautious view.\n\nFind out about the key risks to this Birkenstock Holding narrative.\n\nIf you are not fully aligned with this view or simply prefer to work from the raw numbers yourself, you can build a personalised thesis in just a few minutes with Do it your way .\n\nA good starting point is our analysis highlighting 4 key rewards investors are optimistic about regarding Birkenstock Holding.\n\nIf you stop at just one stock, you could miss out on other opportunities that fit your style, so consider widening your search with a few targeted screeners.\n\nHunt for quality at a discount by scanning companies our system tags as 53 high quality undervalued stocks , then shortlist the ones that fit your own checklist.\n\nFocus on resilience first and see which businesses score well in our 85 resilient stocks with low risk scores , giving you a starting point for steadier compounding potential.\n\nSpot future leaders early by checking the screener containing 23 high quality undiscovered gems , where strong fundamentals have not yet attracted broad market attention.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

This article is designed to help you frame that question clearly.\n\nThe stock has been relatively steady over the last week with a 0.1% return. The 30 day return of 6.4%, year to date return of 16.1%, 1 year return of a 9.7% decline, 3 year return of 0.2% and 5 year return of 23.0% give a mixed picture that can change how investors think about both upside and risk.\n\nThese moves sit against a backdrop of ongoing interest in building materials and timber markets, along with investor attention on how producers like West Fraser Timber balance capital investment, costs and shareholder returns.

      "Content": "Get insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\n\nMagnite (NasdaqGS:MGNI) has expanded its collaboration with The New York Times, becoming the preferred platform for private marketplace deals tied to the publisher's mobile in-app ad supply.\n\nThe agreement focuses on premium mobile in-app inventory within The New York Times ecosystem, giving advertisers streamlined access to its audience.\n\nMagnite enters this new phase of its relationship with The New York Times with its shares trading around $11.70. The stock is up 3.6% over the past week but has seen a 23.5% decline over the past month, a 27.1% decline year to date, a 41.5% decline over the past year, and an 80% decline over five years. Those moves frame how investors have been treating NasdaqGS:MGNI even as it secures new publisher partnerships.\n\nFor investors tracking the ad tech space, this collaboration highlights how Magnite is positioning itself around premium mobile publishers and app environments. As mobile in-app advertising continues to attract brand budgets, relationships with high profile media owners like The New York Times can be an important part of how Magnite competes for both advertiser demand and publisher supply.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Magnite by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Magnite.\n\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Magnite. See which could impact your investment.\n\nFor Magnite, becoming the preferred platform for The New York Times’s mobile in-app private marketplace deals tightens its grip on premium, brand safe inventory at a time when advertisers are paying close attention to where their ads appear. This gives Magnite another high quality supply partner alongside competitors such as The Trade Desk on the buy side and PubMatic or PubMatic backed offerings on the sell side, which can matter when agencies consolidate spend with fewer platforms. The in-app focus also lines up with a broader move toward more controlled environments, especially as AI-powered search and changing discovery habits affect how users reach publisher content.\n\nThe New York Times agreement supports the narrative that Magnite is building out premium omnichannel inventory across mobile and CTV, adding another well known publisher relationship to its existing streaming and digital partners.\n\nDeeper reliance on a smaller set of marquee publishers could add to the customer concentration risk already highlighted in the narrative if a few partners represent a large share of transaction volume.\n\nThe mobile in-app angle and private marketplace focus are more prominent in this news than in the CTV centric discussion in the narrative, so some of this app specific opportunity may not be fully reflected there.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Magnite to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ Greater dependence on large, branded publishers such as The New York Times can increase sensitivity to contract terms, pricing changes, or shifts to in-house solutions.\n\n⚠️ Competition from other independent and walled garden ad platforms, including Google and Meta, may limit how much budget flows through Magnite’s in-app and private marketplace offerings.\n\n🎁 Preferred access to premium in-app inventory can help Magnite stand out with advertisers that prioritize brand safety, measurement, and controlled buying environments.\n\n🎁 This deal adds to recent partnerships around streaming, AI driven curation, and live content, giving Magnite a broader set of use cases to offer agencies and brands.\n\nFrom here, it is worth watching how much advertiser demand actually routes through Magnite’s DV+ platform for New York Times in-app deals, and whether agencies start consolidating more mobile and CTV buying through the same pipes. Pay attention to any commentary from Magnite on the mix of private marketplace versus open auction volumes, and whether similar preferred partner deals emerge with other premium publishers.

Investors are closely watching its role in private credit and other non traditional financing activities. Recent market discussion has focused on how these business lines affect fee stability, fundraising conditions and sentiment toward alternative managers in general.\n\nAres Management currently has a valuation score of 1 out of 6 . In this article, we will look at how different valuation methods assess the stock today, then finish by discussing a more complete way to think about valuation beyond any single model.\n\nAres Management scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\n\nThe Excess Returns model looks at how much profit a company is expected to generate above the return that equity investors require, then capitalizes those extra profits into an estimated value per share.\n\nFor Ares Management, the model starts with a book value of $13.68 per share and a stable earnings figure of $6.27 per share, based on weighted future return on equity estimates from 4 analysts. The average return on equity used in the model is 29.90%, while the cost of equity is set at $1.96 per share. That gap creates an estimated excess return of $4.32 per share.\n\nThose excess returns are projected onto a higher stable book value of $20.99 per share, sourced from weighted future book value estimates from 2 analysts. This is then used to calculate an intrinsic value of $93.91 per share using this model.\n\nWhen compared with the current market price, the Excess Returns valuation implies the shares are about 42.6% overvalued. This suggests the market is paying a premium to the model’s assessment of future excess profits.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nOur Excess Returns analysis suggests Ares Management may be overvalued by 42.6%. Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ares Management.\n\nFor a profitable company like Ares Management, the P/E ratio is a useful quick check because it tells you how many dollars you are paying for each dollar of earnings. What counts as a reasonable P/E depends heavily on how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are, with higher growth and lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.\n\nAres Management currently trades on a P/E of 69.23x. That compares with a Capital Markets industry average P/E of 23.12x and a peer group average of 36.26x, so the shares are priced at a clear premium to both broader industry and closer peers.\n\nSimply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Ares Management is 23.32x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E could look like after accounting for factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, the company’s industry, market cap and specific risk profile. Because it adjusts for these elements rather than relying only on simple peer or industry comparisons, it can give a more tailored sense of what “normal” might be for this stock. Comparing the Fair Ratio of 23.32x with the current P/E of 69.23x suggests the shares are trading above that implied level.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 23 top founder-led companies .\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation, and this is where Narratives come in. They let you connect your own story about Ares Management to a simple forecast that produces a Fair Value you can compare with the current share price. All of this happens within the Narratives tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that millions of investors use. For example, one investor might build a more cautious Ares Management Narrative that leans closer to a US$138.67 bearish Fair Value, while another might build a more optimistic one closer to a US$190.39 bullish Fair Value. As fresh information such as earnings, fundraising updates or news on areas like private credit and data centers flows through, those Narratives update, helping you quickly see whether your Fair Value still supports buying, holding or selling at today’s price.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Ares Management?

      "Content": "Make better investment decisions with Simply Wall St's easy, visual tools that give you a competitive edge.\n\nInvestors may be wondering if Ares Management is priced fairly after its recent swings, and whether the current share price could be offering an opportunity or signaling caution.\n\nOver the last week the stock is up 2.6%, while it shows a 21.2% decline over 30 days, a 19.5% decline year to date, and a 26.1% decline over the past year, set against a 201.9% return over five years and a 75.4% return over three years.\n\nThese moves come as Ares Management continues to attract attention as a large alternative asset manager. Investors are closely watching its role in private credit and other non traditional financing activities. Recent market discussion has focused on how these business lines affect fee stability, fundraising conditions and sentiment toward alternative managers in general.\n\nAres Management currently has a valuation score of 1 out of 6 . In this article, we will look at how different valuation methods assess the stock today, then finish by discussing a more complete way to think about valuation beyond any single model.\n\nAres Management scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\n\nThe Excess Returns model looks at how much profit a company is expected to generate above the return that equity investors require, then capitalizes those extra profits into an estimated value per share.\n\nFor Ares Management, the model starts with a book value of $13.68 per share and a stable earnings figure of $6.27 per share, based on weighted future return on equity estimates from 4 analysts. The average return on equity used in the model is 29.90%, while the cost of equity is set at $1.96 per share. That gap creates an estimated excess return of $4.32 per share.\n\nThose excess returns are projected onto a higher stable book value of $20.99 per share, sourced from weighted future book value estimates from 2 analysts. This is then used to calculate an intrinsic value of $93.91 per share using this model.\n\nWhen compared with the current market price, the Excess Returns valuation implies the shares are about 42.6% overvalued. This suggests the market is paying a premium to the model’s assessment of future excess profits.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nOur Excess Returns analysis suggests Ares Management may be overvalued by 42.6%. Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ares Management.\n\nFor a profitable company like Ares Management, the P/E ratio is a useful quick check because it tells you how many dollars you are paying for each dollar of earnings. What counts as a reasonable P/E depends heavily on how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are, with higher growth and lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.\n\nAres Management currently trades on a P/E of 69.23x. That compares with a Capital Markets industry average P/E of 23.12x and a peer group average of 36.26x, so the shares are priced at a clear premium to both broader industry and closer peers.\n\nSimply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Ares Management is 23.32x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E could look like after accounting for factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, the company’s industry, market cap and specific risk profile. Because it adjusts for these elements rather than relying only on simple peer or industry comparisons, it can give a more tailored sense of what “normal” might be for this stock. Comparing the Fair Ratio of 23.32x with the current P/E of 69.23x suggests the shares are trading above that implied level.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 23 top founder-led companies .\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation, and this is where Narratives come in. They let you connect your own story about Ares Management to a simple forecast that produces a Fair Value you can compare with the current share price. All of this happens within the Narratives tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that millions of investors use. For example, one investor might build a more cautious Ares Management Narrative that leans closer to a US$138.67 bearish Fair Value, while another might build a more optimistic one closer to a US$190.39 bullish Fair Value. As fresh information such as earnings, fundraising updates or news on areas like private credit and data centers flows through, those Narratives update, helping you quickly see whether your Fair Value still supports buying, holding or selling at today’s price.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Ares Management?

      "Content": "Find your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nApplied Materials resolved a US export compliance investigation tied to prior shipments to China, agreeing to a $252.5 million settlement.\n\nThe company announced a major semiconductor R&D alliance with Samsung centered on its new EPIC Center in the US.\n\nThe partnership targets faster development and commercialization of next generation chipmaking technologies.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:AMAT, these updates come at a time when the stock price is $354.91, with a 1 year return of 111.9% and a 3 year return of 215.8%. The recent move, up 10.0% over the past week and 17.6% over the past month, indicates that the market is actively reassessing the company as regulatory uncertainty eases.\n\nWith the export investigation now resolved, management can focus more directly on operations and technology development alongside partners like Samsung. The EPIC Center collaboration and Applied Materials role in advancing chipmaking tools may influence how you think about the company’s exposure to US based semiconductor R&D in the period ahead.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Applied Materials by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Applied Materials.\n\n📰 Beyond the headline: 1 risk and 4 things going right for Applied Materials that every investor should see.\n\nThe resolution of the US export compliance probe and the Samsung alliance sit on opposite sides of the same coin for Applied Materials. On one hand, the US$252.5 million settlement removes an overhang tied to China export controls, with the Department of Justice and SEC closing their related investigations without action. That gives clearer regulatory footing as Applied leans into AI related chipmaking demand. On the other hand, the EPIC Center partnership with Samsung and the new 2nm and beyond tools highlight how tightly Applied is tying its future to leading edge logic, memory and advanced packaging alongside customers that also work with competitors such as ASML, Lam Research and Tokyo Electron. For you as an investor, the key question is whether the combination of compliance costs, heavier R&D and large capital commitments to EPIC is adequately supported by the expected pull from AI workloads and next generation devices.\n\nThe Samsung EPIC Center collaboration and new 2nm class systems align with the narrative that AI and advanced architectures like Gate All Around transistors and high bandwidth memory are key growth drivers backed by close customer co development.\n\nThe size of the export settlement and the history of China related scrutiny underline narrative risks around geopolitics and customer concentration, showing how policy shifts can affect revenue visibility in key regions.\n\nThe EPIC Center model of parallel, faster R&D cycles and the depth of collaboration with Samsung add detail that is not fully captured in the earlier narrative focus on general wafer fab expansion and services growth.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Applied Materials to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ Ongoing exposure to export control regimes and geopolitical tensions, particularly involving China, could affect future licensing, shipments and growth in one of Applied Materials largest markets.\n\n⚠️ Large multiyear R&D and facility commitments at EPIC increase fixed costs, which could pressure margins if customer adoption or industry spending on advanced nodes slows compared with current expectations.\n\n🎁 Strong AI related demand for advanced logic, memory and packaging, combined with Samsung joining the EPIC Center, supports Applied Materials position in key technology transitions that customers are prioritizing.\n\n🎁 The closure of Department of Justice and SEC investigations and a defined settlement with the Department of Commerce reduce legal uncertainty, allowing management to focus on execution and technology roadmaps.\n\nFrom here, you may want to watch how quickly programs at the EPIC Center translate into customer qualifications and volume orders, especially for the new deposition, etch and materials systems targeted at 2nm and beyond. It is also worth tracking management commentary on export licensing conditions and China demand to see whether compliance investments are containing regulatory risk. Finally, keep an eye on how Applied Materials guidance for revenue in the US$7.15 billion to US$8.15 billion range for fiscal Q2 progresses over coming quarters as AI data center and memory spending evolve.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Applied Materials, head to the community page for Applied Materials to follow updates on the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "By Eduardo Baptista\n\nBEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - As China prepares for Lunar New Year holidays starting on Sunday, rivals to DeepSeek are scrambling to release artificial-intelligence models a year after it burst onto the scene with its game-changing R1 and V3 models.\n\nWith DeepSeek set to launch ‌its next-generation V4 model soon, according to tech news site The Information, many other Chinese AI firms have released or are preparing to launch ‌their own models in the hopes of stealing the spotlight - or at least avoid being off-guard again during this year's Spring Festival.\n\nBelow are the companies and models looking to make a Spring Festival splash:\n\nDEEPSEEK\n\nThe ​Hangzhou-based startup's V4 would replace last year's V3 model, which powered the AI assistant app that overtook ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple 's App Store in the U.S. Investors and industry insiders are also on the lookout for R2, successor to the R1 model.\n\nThis week DeepSeek fuelled anticipation when its web and mobile chatbot upgraded its \"context window\" - the amount of information it can remember and handle in a single task, from 128,000 to 1 million tokens, the unit of data processed by ‌the AI model.\n\nThis means the chatbot can now process ⁠book-length passages of text to answer a single user command.\n\nBYTEDANCE\n\nThe makers of short-video platform TikTok are soon expected to release an upgrade of Doubao, China's most popular AI chatbot, in terms of active users.\n\nThursday's release of video-generation AI model Seedance 2.0 has generated ⁠comparisons to DeepSeek's global rise, going viral on Chinese social media and drawing widespread praise on X, including from the platform's owner, Elon Musk. Seedance 2.0 can produce high-quality cinematic videos based on a few prompts, or even one.\n\nThe tech giant released picture-generation model Seedream 5.0 Lite on Friday.\n\nALIBABA\n\nAlibaba, the first Chinese firm to respond to DeepSeek's viral ascent last ​year, ​with Qwen 2.5-Max, is preparing to launch Qwen 3.5.\n\nThe e-commerce giant's Qwen app is riding ​a wave of growing domestic usage after it spent 3 billion ‌yuan ($400 million) last week on a coupon giveaway campaign to promote \"agentic commerce\", where AI handles consumers' online shopping.\n\nThis drove more than 120 million consumer orders in the six days through Wednesday, the company said.\n\nZHIPU\n\nZhipu AI released its open-source GLM-5 model on Wednesday, with enhanced coding capabilities and the ability to perform long-running agent tasks.\n\nZhipu is considered one of China's \"AI tigers\" - promising startups vying with the U.S. to win the AI race.

The company's Hong Kong listing raised HK$4.8 billion ($620 million), higher than Zhipu's $558 million.\n\nShanghai-based ​MiniMax has developed popular apps like Hailuo AI, a video generation tool, ​and Talkie, a character interaction app that enables users to engage with AI-powered virtual personas.\n\nTENCENT\n\nTencent's Hunyuan team on Tuesday released a ‌low-storage, compressed AI model, HY-1.8B-2Bit, designed to be used on consumer ​hardware including mobile phones.\n\nIFLYTEK\n\niFlytek on Wednesday released ​Spark X2, trained entirely on Chinese-made chips.

      "Content": "A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.\n\nTransportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on Homeland Security's annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently.\n\nTrade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation's commercial airports could get.\n\nHere’s what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.\n\nFunding for Homeland Security expired at midnight . But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.\n\nAccording to the department’s contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say Homeland Security won’t get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.\n\nDuring past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time , not overnight. About a month into last year’s shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.\n\nJohn Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.\n\n“It’s still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,” Rose said.\n\nIt’s hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there's just a single security checkpoint.\n\nThat’s why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.\n\n“I tell people to do this even in good times,” Rose said.\n\nExperts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.\n\nAirlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security advisor at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes.\n\nMost airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don't wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.\n\n“You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours,\" he said. \"Now it’s two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven't left for the airport yet.”\n\nPassengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.\n\nTSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn't allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.\n\nAt the airport, Rose said, remember to “practice patience and empathy.\"\n\n“Not only are they not getting paid,” he said of TSA agents, “they’re probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.”\n\nThe White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.\n\nLawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.\n\nDemocrats have said they won’t help approve more funding for Homeland Security until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIn a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel & Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.\n\n“Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the statement said.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/15f06786-7077-32b8-94ef-1264e0af505e/inventiva-ceo%3A-phase-3.html",
      "Content": "Phase 3 NATiV3 fully enrolled: Inventiva says the registrational cohort (1,009 patients randomized 1:1:1 plus ~400 exploratory patients) is in data cleaning ahead of database lock, with top-line lanifibranor results expected in H2 .\n\nPositioning and efficacy: Lanifibranor is a pan‑PPAR oral candidate intended as an add‑on to GLP‑1s for F2/F3 MASH (addressable U.S. F2/F3 population ~ 375,000 ), and Phase 2b showed fibrosis and HbA1c benefits that management says could be particularly valuable in F3 and diabetic patients.\n\nSafety and commercialization preparedness: Management characterizes weight gain as a tolerability issue (≈30% ≥5% weight gain) that can be mitigated by SGLT2 combination, and says the company is positioned to self‑launch with cash runway to Q3 2027 assuming positive data and a €118M financing tranche.\n\nInterested in Inventiva S.A. Sponsored ADR? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ:IVA) CEO Andrew Obenshain said the company is preparing for a second-half phase 3 readout for lanifibranor in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), describing the trial as fully enrolled and in the process of data cleaning ahead of database lock and top-line results.\n\nObenshain said the MASH field has “evolved tremendously” in recent years after a history of clinical failures, citing two approvals, multiple acquisitions, and what he described as validation of commercial potential. He pointed to Madrigal’s work as evidence the fibrosis stage 2 and stage 3 (F2/F3) segment could represent a “billion-dollar market.”\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nHe also outlined how Inventiva has changed over roughly the past 18 months, beginning with an October 2024 recapitalization intended to extend cash runway. Obenshain credited board chair Mark Pruzanski—identified as former CEO of Intercept and a longtime MASH executive—with helping recruit a clinical management team and adding experienced leadership in R&D and regulatory. Obenshain said his own focus as CEO has been fundraising as well as commercial and general and administrative functions.\n\n“People and money are what actually makes a biotech hum,” he said, adding that the company now has the team and capital needed to execute the phase 3 program and prepare for potential regulatory filing.\n\n→ Is Albemarle Setting Up for a Lithium-Fueled Rebound?\n\nLanifibranor is a pan-PPAR agonist being studied for F2 and F3 patients. Obenshain argued the drug could fit as an oral therapy added on top of GLP-1 drugs, which he expects to be a common “backbone” treatment in MASH.\n\nOn market sizing, he said there are more than 15 million patients with MASH in the U.S., and that diagnosis rates are rising with new product launches and increasing awareness. He said the current addressable F2/F3 population is approximately 375,000 patients. He described a segmentation framework based on fibrosis stage (F2 vs. F3) and diabetes status (around 40% non-diabetic and 60% diabetic), forming “a nice two-by-two grid” with roughly equal patient counts in each segment.\n\n→ Cloudflare: Another AI-Disrupted Stock You Might Want to Buy\n\nObenshain suggested lanifibranor may be particularly attractive for F3 patients due to the clinical focus on preventing progression to cirrhosis (F4) and because, in his words, physicians may choose the “biggest hammer” against fibrosis in that setting. He compared lanifibranor’s phase 2b fibrosis effect size (18% after six months versus placebo) with resmetirom’s (which he said showed a 12% effect size after 12 months). He also said lanifibranor has shown an ability to reduce HbA1c, which he believes may make it more compelling for patients with diabetes.\n\nHe added that resmetirom and lanifibranor could be closer substitutes in F2 non-diabetic patients, where tolerability considerations such as weight gain may influence patient and physician preferences.\n\nObenshain said the phase 3 NATiV3 trial is randomized 1:1:1 across placebo, 800 mg daily, and 1,200 mg daily dosing arms, with 1,009 patients in the main registrational cohort. Patients are treated for 18 months, with liver biopsies at baseline and at the end of treatment, along with noninvasive tests (NITs) during the study.\n\nHe also described an additional blinded exploratory cohort for patients who screen-failed the biopsy criteria for the registrational population—those found to have F1 or F4 instead of F2 or F3. Inventiva has enrolled about 400 patients in that group, he said, with the majority being F1 and roughly 100 being F4. He said data from F1 and F4 patients could help inform a future outcomes trial, with F4 positioned as a likely next development direction.\n\nOn retention, Obenshain said the trial was powered conservatively with an assumption that dropout rates could be as high as 30% given the longer 18-month duration versus earlier studies. He said the company previously disclosed it was below the 30% threshold required for a financing tranche, without providing a specific figure, and that the trial remains “well within the power” assumptions.\n\nObenshain said Inventiva’s phase 2b study had a different primary endpoint (SAF score), but it also measured fibrosis and steatosis outcomes that are central to phase 3. He said NATiV3’s primary endpoint is a dual requirement: improvement in fibrosis stage and improvement in steatosis (fatty liver), which he described as a more difficult hurdle and potentially less vulnerable to placebo effects. He stated the dual endpoint effect size in phase 2b was 24%, while fibrosis alone was 18%, and said phase 3 powering was done more conservatively than those phase 2b results.\n\nHe highlighted several differences between phase 2 and phase 3 populations:\n\nFibrosis stages: Phase 2 included F1 patients, while phase 3 excludes them; Obenshain said removing F1 patients made effect sizes “the same to slightly better.”\n\nDiabetes prevalence: Phase 3 includes more patients with diabetes, which he attributed to U.S.-based enrollment; he said efficacy in patients with diabetes was “the same to slightly better.”\n\nGLP-1 use: GLP-1 drugs were not available during phase 2; in phase 3, about 14% of patients entered on a stable GLP-1 dose, which he said should be balanced across arms.\n\nHe added that patients were allowed to add GLP-1s or SGLT2s during the study, but not at higher “MASH dose” levels; rather, the permitted doses were intended for diabetes control. He said a “mid-single digit” percentage of patients added GLP-1 therapy during the study.\n\nAddressing historical concerns around PPAR drugs, Obenshain said lanifibranor is a novel chemical entity and not based on the thiazolidinedione (TZD) backbone. He described it as rationally designed using lessons from prior PPAR programs, including seeking more modest PPAR-gamma binding (which he compared to pioglitazone rather than rosiglitazone) while also engaging PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta.\n\nOn weight gain, he said about 50% of patients experienced no weight gain, 20% had under 5% weight gain, and 30% had 5% or more. He said the weight gain tends to rise and plateau after about six months, and described early volume expansion followed by changes in fat distribution and muscle effects as contributing factors. He also said Inventiva conducted a study combining lanifibranor with an SGLT2 inhibitor, which he said mitigated weight gain completely.\n\nHe characterized weight gain as more of a tolerability than a safety issue, noting that while about 30% of phase 2 patients gained weight, it was reported as an adverse event in only “low double digits” as a percentage, suggesting many physicians did not view it as an adverse event.\n\nLooking ahead, Obenshain said GLP-1 combinations make sense and suggested an all-oral regimen pairing an oral GLP-1 with lanifibranor could be attractive. He noted that resmetirom has been used alongside GLP-1s, citing a figure he said was about 50% based on public comments.\n\nOn strategic interest, he said some pharma executives have been “burned by PPAR” historically, but that he believes phase 3 data should address those concerns if positive.\n\nOn funding, Obenshain said Inventiva is “structuring ourselves to be able to launch this ourselves.” He said the company has cash runway to Q3 2027, assuming positive data and receipt of a third financing tranche of EUR 118 million, and that the additional runway would provide flexibility to determine next steps, including potential fundraising to support NDA approval and commercialization.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ: IVA) is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases. The company's core expertise lies in the modulation of nuclear receptors and signaling pathways that regulate fibrosis, inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Inventiva's scientific platform integrates medicinal chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, and translational sciences to advance a diversified pipeline of therapeutic candidates.\n\nThe company's lead asset, lanifibranor (IVA337), is a pan-PPAR agonist in Phase III development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe article \" Inventiva CEO: Phase 3 Lanifibranor MASH Trial Fully Enrolled, Top-Line Data Due in H2 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

He also said lanifibranor has shown an ability to reduce HbA1c, which he believes may make it more compelling for patients with diabetes.\n\nHe added that resmetirom and lanifibranor could be closer substitutes in F2 non-diabetic patients, where tolerability considerations such as weight gain may influence patient and physician preferences.\n\nObenshain said the phase 3 NATiV3 trial is randomized 1:1:1 across placebo, 800 mg daily, and 1,200 mg daily dosing arms, with 1,009 patients in the main registrational cohort. Patients are treated for 18 months, with liver biopsies at baseline and at the end of treatment, along with noninvasive tests (NITs) during the study.\n\nHe also described an additional blinded exploratory cohort for patients who screen-failed the biopsy criteria for the registrational population—those found to have F1 or F4 instead of F2 or F3. Inventiva has enrolled about 400 patients in that group, he said, with the majority being F1 and roughly 100 being F4. He said data from F1 and F4 patients could help inform a future outcomes trial, with F4 positioned as a likely next development direction.\n\nOn retention, Obenshain said the trial was powered conservatively with an assumption that dropout rates could be as high as 30% given the longer 18-month duration versus earlier studies. He said the company previously disclosed it was below the 30% threshold required for a financing tranche, without providing a specific figure, and that the trial remains “well within the power” assumptions.\n\nObenshain said Inventiva’s phase 2b study had a different primary endpoint (SAF score), but it also measured fibrosis and steatosis outcomes that are central to phase 3. He said NATiV3’s primary endpoint is a dual requirement: improvement in fibrosis stage and improvement in steatosis (fatty liver), which he described as a more difficult hurdle and potentially less vulnerable to placebo effects. He stated the dual endpoint effect size in phase 2b was 24%, while fibrosis alone was 18%, and said phase 3 powering was done more conservatively than those phase 2b results.\n\nHe highlighted several differences between phase 2 and phase 3 populations:\n\nFibrosis stages: Phase 2 included F1 patients, while phase 3 excludes them; Obenshain said removing F1 patients made effect sizes “the same to slightly better.”\n\nDiabetes prevalence: Phase 3 includes more patients with diabetes, which he attributed to U.S.-based enrollment; he said efficacy in patients with diabetes was “the same to slightly better.”\n\nGLP-1 use: GLP-1 drugs were not available during phase 2; in phase 3, about 14% of patients entered on a stable GLP-1 dose, which he said should be balanced across arms.\n\nHe added that patients were allowed to add GLP-1s or SGLT2s during the study, but not at higher “MASH dose” levels; rather, the permitted doses were intended for diabetes control. He said a “mid-single digit” percentage of patients added GLP-1 therapy during the study.\n\nAddressing historical concerns around PPAR drugs, Obenshain said lanifibranor is a novel chemical entity and not based on the thiazolidinedione (TZD) backbone. He described it as rationally designed using lessons from prior PPAR programs, including seeking more modest PPAR-gamma binding (which he compared to pioglitazone rather than rosiglitazone) while also engaging PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta.\n\nOn weight gain, he said about 50% of patients experienced no weight gain, 20% had under 5% weight gain, and 30% had 5% or more. He said the weight gain tends to rise and plateau after about six months, and described early volume expansion followed by changes in fat distribution and muscle effects as contributing factors. He also said Inventiva conducted a study combining lanifibranor with an SGLT2 inhibitor, which he said mitigated weight gain completely.\n\nHe characterized weight gain as more of a tolerability than a safety issue, noting that while about 30% of phase 2 patients gained weight, it was reported as an adverse event in only “low double digits” as a percentage, suggesting many physicians did not view it as an adverse event.\n\nLooking ahead, Obenshain said GLP-1 combinations make sense and suggested an all-oral regimen pairing an oral GLP-1 with lanifibranor could be attractive. He noted that resmetirom has been used alongside GLP-1s, citing a figure he said was about 50% based on public comments.\n\nOn strategic interest, he said some pharma executives have been “burned by PPAR” historically, but that he believes phase 3 data should address those concerns if positive.\n\nOn funding, Obenshain said Inventiva is “structuring ourselves to be able to launch this ourselves.” He said the company has cash runway to Q3 2027, assuming positive data and receipt of a third financing tranche of EUR 118 million, and that the additional runway would provide flexibility to determine next steps, including potential fundraising to support NDA approval and commercialization.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ: IVA) is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.

He said the company previously disclosed it was below the 30% threshold required for a financing tranche, without providing a specific figure, and that the trial remains “well within the power” assumptions.\n\nObenshain said Inventiva’s phase 2b study had a different primary endpoint (SAF score), but it also measured fibrosis and steatosis outcomes that are central to phase 3. He said NATiV3’s primary endpoint is a dual requirement: improvement in fibrosis stage and improvement in steatosis (fatty liver), which he described as a more difficult hurdle and potentially less vulnerable to placebo effects. He stated the dual endpoint effect size in phase 2b was 24%, while fibrosis alone was 18%, and said phase 3 powering was done more conservatively than those phase 2b results.\n\nHe highlighted several differences between phase 2 and phase 3 populations:\n\nFibrosis stages: Phase 2 included F1 patients, while phase 3 excludes them; Obenshain said removing F1 patients made effect sizes “the same to slightly better.”\n\nDiabetes prevalence: Phase 3 includes more patients with diabetes, which he attributed to U.S.-based enrollment; he said efficacy in patients with diabetes was “the same to slightly better.”\n\nGLP-1 use: GLP-1 drugs were not available during phase 2; in phase 3, about 14% of patients entered on a stable GLP-1 dose, which he said should be balanced across arms.\n\nHe added that patients were allowed to add GLP-1s or SGLT2s during the study, but not at higher “MASH dose” levels; rather, the permitted doses were intended for diabetes control. He said a “mid-single digit” percentage of patients added GLP-1 therapy during the study.\n\nAddressing historical concerns around PPAR drugs, Obenshain said lanifibranor is a novel chemical entity and not based on the thiazolidinedione (TZD) backbone. He described it as rationally designed using lessons from prior PPAR programs, including seeking more modest PPAR-gamma binding (which he compared to pioglitazone rather than rosiglitazone) while also engaging PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta.\n\nOn weight gain, he said about 50% of patients experienced no weight gain, 20% had under 5% weight gain, and 30% had 5% or more. He said the weight gain tends to rise and plateau after about six months, and described early volume expansion followed by changes in fat distribution and muscle effects as contributing factors. He also said Inventiva conducted a study combining lanifibranor with an SGLT2 inhibitor, which he said mitigated weight gain completely.\n\nHe characterized weight gain as more of a tolerability than a safety issue, noting that while about 30% of phase 2 patients gained weight, it was reported as an adverse event in only “low double digits” as a percentage, suggesting many physicians did not view it as an adverse event.\n\nLooking ahead, Obenshain said GLP-1 combinations make sense and suggested an all-oral regimen pairing an oral GLP-1 with lanifibranor could be attractive. He noted that resmetirom has been used alongside GLP-1s, citing a figure he said was about 50% based on public comments.\n\nOn strategic interest, he said some pharma executives have been “burned by PPAR” historically, but that he believes phase 3 data should address those concerns if positive.\n\nOn funding, Obenshain said Inventiva is “structuring ourselves to be able to launch this ourselves.” He said the company has cash runway to Q3 2027, assuming positive data and receipt of a third financing tranche of EUR 118 million, and that the additional runway would provide flexibility to determine next steps, including potential fundraising to support NDA approval and commercialization.\n\nInventiva (NASDAQ: IVA) is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases. The company's core expertise lies in the modulation of nuclear receptors and signaling pathways that regulate fibrosis, inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Inventiva's scientific platform integrates medicinal chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, and translational sciences to advance a diversified pipeline of therapeutic candidates.\n\nThe company's lead asset, lanifibranor (IVA337), is a pan-PPAR agonist in Phase III development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe article \" Inventiva CEO: Phase 3 Lanifibranor MASH Trial Fully Enrolled, Top-Line Data Due in H2 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.",

      "Content": "A federal law requiring impairment-detection devices inside all new cars survived a recent push to strip its funding but remains stalled by questions about whether the technology is ready.\n\nRana Abbas Taylor lost her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two nieces when a driver with a blood-alcohol level almost four times the legal limit slammed into their car in January 2019 as the Michigan family drove through Lexington, Kentucky, on the way home from a Florida vacation.\n\nThe tragedy turned Abbas Taylor into an outspoken advocate for stopping the more than 10,000 alcohol-related deaths each year on U.S. roads. Lawmakers attached the Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate Drunk Driving Act to the $1 trillion infrastructure law that then-President Joe Biden signed in 2021.\n\nThe measure, often referred to as the Halt Drunk Driving Act, anticipated that as early as this year, auto companies would be required to roll out technology to “passively” detect when drivers are drunk or impaired and prevent their cars from operating. Regulators can choose from a range of options, including air monitors that sample the car's interior for traces of alcohol, fingertip readers that measure a driver's blood-alcohol level, or scanners that detect signs of impairment in eye or head movements.\n\nMothers Against Drunk Driving called it the most important piece of legislation in the organization's 45-year history. Still, implementation has been bogged down by regulatory delays, without any clear signals that final approval is near.\n\n“The way we measure time is not by days or months or years. It’s by number of lives lost,” Abbas Taylor said in an interview with The Associated Press. “So when we hear manufacturers say, ‘We need more time,’ or ‘The tech is not ready,’ or ‘We’re not there yet,' all we hear is, ‘More people need to die before we’re willing to fix this.’”\n\nA Republican-led effort to remove the Halt Act's funding was defeated in the U.S. House last month by a 268-164 vote.

Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said it specifically requires the technology to be passive, similar to other current safety mandates such as seat belts and air bags.\n\n“There is no switch, there’s no government control, there is no sharing of data,\" he said. “That’s just an unfortunate scare tactic.”\n\nBut Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who authored the defunding effort, said even the dashboard acting on its own could serve as “your judge, your jury, and your executioner.\" He cited the example of a mother who swerves in a snowstorm to avoid hitting a neighbor's pet, only for her car to deactivate itself because it determines she's impaired.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association for U.S. automakers, made a similar case to regulators in 2024, arguing that much more research was needed before mandating the technology.\n\n“Even if 1 in 10,000 trips were expected to experience a false positive, this could result in thousands of unimpaired drivers encountering problems that prevent them from driving each day,” the Alliance wrote.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is establishing the rules to implement the Halt Act, told the AP in an email that it's still “assessing developing technologies for potential deployment” and expects to report back to Congress soon.

      "Content": "GUANGZHOU, China , Feb. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- As a long-standing key bridge between China and the global trading community, the Canton Fair continues to enhance its global cooperation network. Against this backdrop, the 139th Canton Fair will host two major promotion conferences in Frankfurt, Germany on March 10 and Casablanca, Morocco on March 11, respectively.\n\nGermany has long been one of China's most important trading partners in Europe and a key source country of Canton Fair buyers, with attendance increasing by more than 20% over the past five sessions. The 139th Canton Fair Germany Promotion Conference will, for the first time, focus on targeted industry promotion rather than general introduction. Based on local market demand and future industrial trends, the conference will highlight three traditional categories, including vehicles & two-wheelers, health & recreation and gifts & decorations, as well as three emerging sectors including service robots, drones, and intelligent healthcare. This approach aims to help German buyers gain early insights into key exhibitors and products, enabling more efficient sourcing plans.\n\nIn Morocco, where trade with China has expanded steadily in recent years and number of buyers attending the Canton Fair has increased by over 26% for the past five sessions, the Casablanca conference will follow a similarly approach by spotlighting electronics & appliances, fashion, gifts & decorations, alongside the same group of three emerging industries. By focusing on Morocco's role as a gateway to North African markets, the conference aims to support more practical and market-oriented trade connections.\n\nBesides, both conferences will showcase Canton Fair's latest service upgrades, including its digital platforms and smart tools such as the Canton Fair App, the ASK ME intelligent assistant, and booth-level navigation services. These innovations are designed to streamline attendance procedures, improve information access, and enhance overall sourcing experience.\n\nTo enhance accessibility, both conferences will adopt an online-and-offline integrated format. The Germany conference will center on the on-site venue in Frankfurt and extending to cities such as Berlin. Meanwhile, the Morocco promotion will feature Casablanca as the core venue with outreach extending to cities such as Rabat. This hybrid model enables greater participation by buyers.\n\nFor more information, please click:\nGermany: http://survey.cantonfair.org.cn/vm/QcLMAV5.aspx\nMorocco: http://survey.cantonfair.org.cn/vm/YoW6d3v.aspx\n\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-139th-canton-fair-promotion-conferences-to-be-held-in-germany-and-morocco-highlighting-targeted-industry-opportunities-302687444.html",

      "Content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is an extremely volatile asset. This has been a notable trend in recent months. The world's top cryptocurrency is trading 46% below its peak as of this writing. Perhaps it's a good idea to buy the dip.\n\nFirst, though, it's important to gain a better understanding. Here are three things every Bitcoin investor needs to know.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAny Bitcoin investor must know that there will only ever be 21 million units in circulation. This is a hard supply cap etched in the software via halving events that reduce the number of new Bitcoin units mined by a factor of 2 roughly every four years. It makes this asset extremely predictable, as the inflation rate is predetermined.\n\nThat finite supply contrasts starkly with the current monetary system. Governments continue to run up their debt balances, with rising money supplies. There's no end in sight to this financial mismanagement. This is especially true in the U.S. Bitcoin's fixed-supply structure is superior, as market participants aren't seeing their positions being constantly debased.\n\nBlackRock once put out a graphic with an eye-popping statistic. During the 11-year stretch between the start of 2013 and the end of 2023, Bitcoin outperformed every other asset class. The following year, in 2024, it climbed another 120%. In the past decade, Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed 17,000%. Investors worried about the recent dip should zoom out.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited by this sort of monumental gain. That's what happens when an entirely new financial instrument, once viewed as a worthless internet currency in the early days, evolves into a globally recognized asset attracting interest from individuals, corporations, asset managers, and governments.\n\nLast month, Bitcoin celebrated its 17th birthday. In January 2009, the first block was mined on the blockchain. Despite a nearly two-decade lifespan, the Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Most people might not realize this fact.\n\nThis could be surprising, given the high-profile blow-ups in the crypto industry. In the early 2010s, the Mt. Gox exchange was breached. In 2022, FTX went bankrupt after misusing customer funds. When these failures occur, investors can easily lose confidence in digital assets. However, Bitcoin has stood the test of time. This points to its resilience.\n\nInvestors now know more about this crypto to make an informed portfolio decision.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAny Bitcoin investor must know that there will only ever be 21 million units in circulation. This is a hard supply cap etched in the software via halving events that reduce the number of new Bitcoin units mined by a factor of 2 roughly every four years. It makes this asset extremely predictable, as the inflation rate is predetermined.\n\nThat finite supply contrasts starkly with the current monetary system. Governments continue to run up their debt balances, with rising money supplies. There's no end in sight to this financial mismanagement. This is especially true in the U.S. Bitcoin's fixed-supply structure is superior, as market participants aren't seeing their positions being constantly debased.\n\nBlackRock once put out a graphic with an eye-popping statistic. During the 11-year stretch between the start of 2013 and the end of 2023, Bitcoin outperformed every other asset class. The following year, in 2024, it climbed another 120%. In the past decade, Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed 17,000%. Investors worried about the recent dip should zoom out.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited by this sort of monumental gain. That's what happens when an entirely new financial instrument, once viewed as a worthless internet currency in the early days, evolves into a globally recognized asset attracting interest from individuals, corporations, asset managers, and governments.\n\nLast month, Bitcoin celebrated its 17th birthday. In January 2009, the first block was mined on the blockchain. Despite a nearly two-decade lifespan, the Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Most people might not realize this fact.\n\nThis could be surprising, given the high-profile blow-ups in the crypto industry. In the early 2010s, the Mt. Gox exchange was breached. In 2022, FTX went bankrupt after misusing customer funds. When these failures occur, investors can easily lose confidence in digital assets. However, Bitcoin has stood the test of time. This points to its resilience.\n\nInvestors now know more about this crypto to make an informed portfolio decision.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "A few big names dominate tech stock headlines. This is rightfully so, but there are other tech companies worthy of investors' time and money.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is absolutely one. What was once a standard networking and software company is now a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) custom chip builder partnering with the world's top hyperscalers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nWhat separates Broadcom from the pack is its strong financial profile. The company's solid free cash flow, currently standing at $7.4 billion, has enabled it to pay dividends consistently while continuing to invest in growth. Recent earnings reinforce the narrative that Broadcom is a powerhouse .\n\nIn its fourth-quarter 2025 report, Broadcom's revenues grew 28% year over year, and free cash flow was up 36%. Even if growth slows slightly in the coming quarters, Broadcom's robust balance sheet has given it a true economic moat. The company also announced a 10% increase in its dividend in its latest earnings.\n\nBroadcom's stock is somewhat volatile, but historically patient Broadcom investors have been rewarded . As of Feb. 11, the stock has risen 45% over the past 12 months and an astounding 615% over the past five years. Broadcom's market cap has exploded to more than $1 trillion in this time as well, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nWhat's most impressive about Broadcom is its ability to execute and deliver. Broadcom's $162 billion backlog should ensure it has room to run for the next decade.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ: COIN ) just a 22% chance of beating Wall Street estimates ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report today.\n\nThe Polymarket contract tracking whether COIN will exceed the Street consensus of $0.61 in GAAP EPS has attracted over $50,000 in volume.\n\nThe 78% odds of a miss reflect mounting skepticism as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) plunged nearly 50% from its October peak.\n\nThe carnage extends across crypto markets, with Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH ) down 33% this year and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP ) shedding 25%.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nProfessional traders demand transparency — see why Kraken Pro has become one of crypto's most trusted advanced trading platforms.\n\nAnalysts expect Coinbase to report $1.84 billion in revenue, down from $2.27 billion a year earlier.\n\nCOIN shares are down 37% this year, closing Wednesday at $152.16.\n\nWall Street projects transaction revenue of just $1.03 billion, representing a 33.6% year-over-year decline.\n\nCoinbase’s core profit engine depends on trading fees, and with Bitcoin and Ethereum volumes collapsing, that revenue stream appears to be drying up fast.\n\nCrypto bettors expect CEO Brian Armstrong to emphasize subscription and services revenue, which grew 9% quarter-over-quarter to $698 million in Q3.\n\nTrending: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nPolymarket traders are watching for buzzwords around regulatory clarity, stablecoin growth, and references to Bitcoin’s four-year cycle.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified before Congress that the Treasury has no authority to stabilize crypto markets. The statement sent shockwaves through the industry and undermined hopes for government support.\n\nVanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel identified multiple pressures hammering Bitcoin:\n\nFutures open interest collapsed from $61 billion to $49 billion in a week as leverage unwound\n\nMiners sold Bitcoin to fund operations amid failed AI pivots\n\nRising quantum computing fears spooked investors about potential encryption vulnerabilities\n\nThis has all occurred while stocks and precious metals hit all time highs, further undermining crypto’s claim as a safe haven asset.\n\nSee Also: Disney Was Built on Character IP — This Pre-IPO Company Is Using the Same Playbook\n\nCoinbase reports after market close, with the stock trading at a P/E ratio of around 26 leaving little room for disappointment.\n\nIf the Polymarket odds prove accurate and Coinbase misses even the lowered bar of $0.61 in GAAP EPS, the possibility for further pain for the stock is high.\n\nCoinbase has beaten estimates in seven of the last ten quarters.\n\nBut with crypto markets in freefall and retail traders capitulating, this quarter could mark a turning point for the exchange.\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Put professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.\n\nBuilding a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nRad AI's award-winning artificial intelligence technology helps transform data chaos into actionable insights, enabling the creation of high-performing content with measurable ROI. Their Regulation A+ offering allows investors to participate at $0.85 per share with a minimum investment of $1,000, providing an opportunity to diversify portfolios into early-stage AI innovation.

Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nLightstone DIRECT gives accredited investors direct access to institutional-grade real estate, going beyond typical crowdfunding platforms. By cutting out middlemen, it aligns investor and manager interests while providing exposure to a $12B+ portfolio spanning multifamily, industrial, hospitality, retail, office, and life science properties. This approach allows investors to diversify their portfolios across multiple property types and markets , gaining professional-grade real estate exposure without the fees or misalignment common on other platforms.\n\nMasterworks enables investors to diversify into blue-chip art, an alternative asset class with historically low correlation to stocks and bonds. Through fractional ownership of museum-quality works by artists like Banksy, Basquiat, and Picasso, investors gain access without the high costs or complexities of owning art outright. With hundreds of offerings and strong historical exits on select works, Masterworks adds a scarce, globally traded asset to portfolios seeking long-term diversification.\n\nBAM Capital offers accredited investors a way to diversify beyond public markets through institutional-grade multifamily real estate . With over $1.85 billion in completed transactions and guidance from Senior Economic Advisor Tony Landa, the firm targets income and long-term growth as supply tightens and renter demand remains strong—especially in Midwest markets. Its income-focused and growth-oriented funds provide exposure to real assets designed to be less tied to stock market volatility.\n\nAs digital assets become a larger part of diversified portfolios, traders increasingly look for platforms that offer transparency, efficiency, and control. Kraken Pro is an advanced trading interface from Kraken , one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, designed for users who want more sophisticated tools without added complexity.

And of course, top and bottom line peaks are projected this year.\n\nWall Street expects Micron’s EPS to spike 300% in FY26 to a record $33.22, a staggering acceleration that reflects both pricing power and volume growth. Better still, FY27 EPS is projected to climb another 35% to a whopping $44.95.\n\nSince most recently crushing earnings expectations for its fiscal first quarter in December, Micron’s FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates have continued to trend higher and are now up 78% and 91% in the last 60 days, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstonishingly, the year-ago earnings estimates picture shows that FY26 and FY27 EPS revisions have now skyrocketed 207% and 490%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nJust as captivating is that despite such an exhilarating rally, Micron stock still trades at 12X forward earnings. This is well below the rather stretched P/E premiums other high-growth tech stocks can command and offers a distinct discount to the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nMore intriguing, MU trades nicely beneath Sandisk Corporation SNDK and Western Digital’s WDC forward earnings multiples of 23X and 31X, as two of the other prime beneficiaries of the global memory chip shortage.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, an advantage that strongly supports the continued momentum in its stock.

However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount.\n\nPerformance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results.\n\nPerformance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.\n\nSources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2026 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.\n\nAll data is as of January 31, 2026 unless otherwise noted.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260213495616/en/\n\nContacts\n\nLiberty All-Star® Equity Fund\n1-800-241-1850\nwww.all-starfunds.com\nlibinfo@alpsinc.com",

      "Content": "STORY: U.S. stocks were little changed on Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 ticking up fractionally, and the Nasdaq making the biggest move with a less than quarter percentage-point drop. All three indexes declined for the week, with tech stocks on a roller-coaster ride due to uncertainty over AI disruption of the sector, as well as massive AI-related spending. Nancy Tengler is CEO and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. “I think you're seeing a market that's tug-of-warring between fear and greed. And that's typical in these periods. Just going back to DeepSeek, you know, Broadcom was down 15% and ended up 102. Google was down 18, ended up 100. In these periods, it's very difficult to step in. And so the Nasdaq is getting punished. But we don't think the technology trade's over. And frankly, without technology, it's going to be very hard for the market to go up in any sustainable fashion.” Shares of Nvidia and Apple, both down more than 2%, were the biggest drags on the S&P 500. Shares of Applied Materials provided the strongest boost, jumping more than 8% after the chipmaking-equipment firm forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations. And shares of networking equipment provider Arista Networks gained nearly 5% after forecasting annual revenue above expectations. Meanwhile, the latest inflation data showed U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in January. Traders now put the chances of an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June at more than 50%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

      "Content": "When markets are up, we feel like geniuses. But when they turn volatile, investors often ask a different question: “What keeps paying me no matter what?” Having a stable income suddenly feels more valuable and can make the sting of volatility hurt a little less. I’m talking about the kind of income that shows up quarter after quarter, even when headlines turn negative and stock prices swing.\n\nThat is where companies on the Dividend Aristocrats list stands out. These are S&P 500 companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. They have managed not only to pay but also to increase shareholder payouts.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nInvestors in Search of Alpha Are Fleeing Tech Stocks for These 3 High-Yield Sectors Instead\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nToday, I’m screening my Dividend Aristocrats list, which are not only consistent dividend payers but also still growing earnings and cash flow, supported by solid analyst coverage.\n\nUsing Barchart’s Stock Screener, I selected the following filters to get my list:\n\nAnnual Dividend Yield % (FWD): Left blank so I can sort it from highest to lowest.\n\nCash Flow Growth Last Year (%): At least 1% increase year-over-year, displaying the company’s ability to reinvest and grow dividend payments.\n\nEPS Growth Vs Prev Yr: Greater than 1%. Companies whose net profit increased over the past year.\n\nNumber of Analysts: 12 or more. A higher number suggests greater confidence in the rating.\n\nAnalyst Rating: Consensus Moderate to Strong Buy\n\nDividend Investing Ideas: Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nWith these filters set, I ran the screen and got 19 results and I'll cover three companies with the highest forward annual dividend yield.\n\nLet’s kick off the list with the first Dividend Aristocrat:\n\nAmcor Plc is a global packaging company that makes flexible and rigid packaging for various industries, including food, healthcare, and consumer products. Its wide product portfolio helps protect products, extend shelf life, and improve sustainability across markets worldwide.\n\nIn its recent quarterly financials, Amcor reported that sales rose 68% YOY to $5.4 billion and net income was up 9% to $177 million. But that’s not the whole story- its operating cash flow grew 5.22% in 2025, and full-year EPS increased 7.5%, which suggests (slow but) steady growth.\n\nAmcor has paid increasing dividends for 27 consecutive years. Today, it pays a forward annual dividend of $2.60, translating to a yield of just over 5%.\n\nMeanwhile, 16 analysts rate the stock a “Moderate Buy”. It has around 20% upside if it achieves its high target of $60.\n\nThe second Dividend Aristocrat is Federal Realty Investment Trust , a REIT that operates retail and mixed-use properties in high-income U.S. markets, primarily through shopping centers and urban retail locations.\n\nIts most recent quarterly financials reported that sales were up 6% YOY to $322 million. Net income also increased 1% to $61 million. Federal Realty’s operating cash flow rose 3.37% over the past year, while its EPS grew 3.51%, which is pretty solid as REITs are not usually built for rapid earnings expansion.\n\nFederal Realty has increased its dividends for 58 consecutive years, and currently pays a forward annual dividend of $4.52, translating to a yield of approximately 4.3%.\n\nFurther, a consensus among 19 analysts rates the stock a “Moderate Buy” and suggests there’s around 15% upside should it reach its target high of $120.\n\nThe final Dividend Aristocrat on my list today is McCormick & Company, a renowned food company known mainly for its wide range of spices used to enhance the taste of home and commercial food meals around the world. Actually, I think there’s a strong chance that at least one of its products is already sitting in my kitchen cabinet.\n\nIn its recent quarterly financials, McCormick reported sales increased 3% YOY to $1.9 billion, and operating cash flow rose 4.37%. On the bottom line, net income grew 5.3% to $227 million.\n\nIn terms of providing shareholder value, McCormick increased its dividends for 40 consecutive years, paying a forward annual dividend of $1.92, translating to a yield of ~2.7%.\n\nWith that, a consensus among 13 analysts rate the stock a “Moderate Buy” with as much as 24% upside potential if the stock hits its high target of $89.\n\nThere you have it, three of the highest-yielding Dividend Aristocrats worth buying today. They didn’t make the noisiest headlines, but they do continue to provide a stable source of income even through volatility. Though, as they say, nothing lasts forever, and past years’ results may not be as good as this year. But remember, it’s how all funds are sold- so it’s never wrong consider the fundamentals first.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Walmart WMT shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and brick-and-mortar retail peers but also Amazon AMZN and many members of the Magnificent 7 group.\n\nWith the company set to report quarterly results on Thursday, February 19th, it will be interesting to see whether the stock can maintain its momentum after the results.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart shares (green line, up +20.2%) relative to the Mag 7 group (blue line, down -5.4%), the S&P 500 index (red line, down -0.4%), Amazon (purple line, down -13.9%) and Target shares (orange line in the chart, up +18.2%). Target has also been added to the chart, though the company will be reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, March 3 rd .\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe should keep in mind, however, that the performance pecking order shifts when we move the starting point of this chart back by 12 months, as shown below. Target has enjoyed an impressive run this year, but the retailer’s one-year performance is comparable to Amazon’s.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart’s share price outperformance reflects the market’s collective optimism about the company’s large and growing digital business, which has enabled it to tap new growth opportunities such as third-party fulfillment and advertising.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce business complements its core merchandise, which remains heavily indexed toward groceries, other essentials, and must-have necessities. This orientation towards essentials, coupled with Walmart’s well-earned reputation for low prices, provides the company’s results with a high degree of cyclical stability.\n\nWe should note, however, that a big contributing factor to Walmart’s stock market momentum over the last few years reflects its ability to gain market share among higher-income households. Driving those gains has been a combination of higher-income households trading down to Walmart in response to inflation and the ease of using the company’s e-commerce capabilities. Walmart has consistently flagged market-share gains across all income categories, particularly in the high-income category, and we expect further gains on that front in this quarterly report as well.\n\nResults likely benefited from pulled-forward demand in anticipation of tariffs, particularly in some categories like electronics. Growth in e-commerce and steadily lower losses in that business, coupled with gains from third-party fulfillment and advertising, are some of the other areas that will benefit results this quarter.\n\nThe e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable and will likely become a significant contributor to earnings in 2026 and beyond. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15% of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, management noted earlier in the year that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales were from domestically sourced products, which gave them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart’s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60% of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix.\n\nManagement has reiterated its commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart’s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.73 in EPS on $189.9 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +5.2%, respectively. Estimates have been stable, though they have nudged up a hair since the quarter began.\n\nIn terms of same-store sales, the expectation is of U.S. comps (ex fuel) of +4.17%, which will compare to a +4.4% gain in the preceding quarter (vs. expectations of +4.02%), and a +4.9% gain in the year-earlier period (vs. expectations of +4.36%). A positive general merchandise read will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2025 Q4 earnings season scorecard , we now have results from 13 of the 31 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 13 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported Q4 results belong mostly to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have several restaurant companies on deck to report this week as well.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 13 retailers that have reported are up +6.3% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues, with 46.2% beating EPS estimates and 76.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the EPS beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. In fact, the Q4 EPS beats percentage at 46.2% matches the lowest beats percentage for this group of Retail sector companies in the preceding 20-quarter period. Unlike EPS beats, revenue beats are far more numerous and tracking above historical averages.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 13 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +5.9% on +13.6% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart now a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThrough Friday, February 13 th , we have seen Q4 results from 371 S&P 500 members, or 74.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS estimates and 72.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have more than 400 companies on deck to report results this week, including 56 index members. The week’s lineup includes a blend of operators such as Palo Alto Networks, DoorDash, Etsy, and Booking Holdings, as well as traditional bellwethers such as Toll Brothers, Deere, and others.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the growth rates for these 371 index members with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages for this group companies relative to what we had seen from them in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison chart below puts the Q4 net margins for the 371 companies that have reported in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for the current period (2026 Q1) have risen modestly in recent days, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2026 Q1 estimates have increased modestly for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of January, including Tech, Industrials, Retail, Utilities, and Business Services. On the negative side, Q1 estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Energy, Medical, and Consumer Discretionary sectors.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Analyzing the Evolving Earnings Picture: What Should Investors Know?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, investors had sticker shock when the company's plans for $200 billion capex were revealed.\n\nThe trends in the chart sum up why Wall Street is getting skittish over Amazon. The inverse correlation between rising infrastructure spend and decelerating cash flow generation is a major concern for investors.\n\nWhere investors may be missing the mark is looking at Amazon's revenue growth. Over the last year, sales and operating profits from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division have consistently risen. In other words, Amazon's high-margin cloud business is experiencing both accelerating sales and profit margins.\n\nThis dynamic is allowing the company to allocate capital across so many different AI-related projects. Building its own data centers and custom chips, alongside its strategic investment in Anthropic, is helping Amazon vertically integrate its AI operations.\n\nIn the long run, this should significantly reduce costs and lead to stronger earnings growth. When you think about it this way, Amazon's playbook to double down on its AI infrastructure roadmap looks savvy. While rising capex may be a near-term dent for free cash flow, the long-term gains are hard to deny.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is hovering near its lowest level throughout the entire AI revolution.\n\nConsidering sales from AWS are beginning to reaccelerate and are complemented by robust profit margins, I am confident that Amazon's decision to continue investing in AI infrastructure makes sense strategically. While I understand investor concerns around execution risk, I think Amazon has already done a fine job of mitigating these worries.\n\nTo me, the sell-off in Amazon stock is overdone, and the stock looks like a no-brainer right now. Against this backdrop, I'd say Amazon isn't just a good stock to buy -- it's a great one for long-term investors to buy and hold.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

With hundreds of offerings and strong historical exits on select works, Masterworks adds a scarce, globally traded asset to portfolios seeking long-term diversification.\n\nBAM Capital offers accredited investors a way to diversify beyond public markets through institutional-grade multifamily real estate .

The latest beat-and-raise quarter strengthens the short term catalyst of execution on revenue growth and margins, but it does not eliminate the key risk that rising R&D and operating costs could again outpace sales and pressure profitability if demand or pricing weakens.\n\nThe most relevant recent announcement is the first quarter 2026 guidance for revenue of US$292 million to US$306 million and operating margins in the low to mid teens. This outlook builds on the stronger than prior year 2025 results and puts the spotlight squarely on whether Silicon Motion can convert its design wins into sustained top line growth while keeping expenses in check and margins within its guided range.\n\nYet, against this stronger backdrop, the ongoing risk that margin pressure could re emerge from high R&D spend is something investors should be aware of...\n\nRead the full narrative on Silicon Motion Technology (it's free!)\n\nSilicon Motion Technology's narrative projects $1.2 billion revenue and $196.6 million earnings by 2028.

The earnings beat consensus estimates for adjusted EPS and revenue, and the stock is trading 10% higher at the time of writing, Friday morning, Feb. 13, according to Yahoo Finance .\n\nThe supplier of semiconductor and semiconductor-related fabrication equipment reported revenue of $7 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline, yet the earnings report got investors excited and prompted Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to raise his price target for Applied Materials.\n\nThe cause of excitement was CEO Gary Dickerson’s prepared remarks during the earnings call : “For Applied, we expect to grow our semiconductor equipment business more than 20% this calendar year. We see the demand profile weighted towards the second half of the calendar year, with availability of customer cleanroom space being a key factor pacing the rate of investment.”\n\nDickerson continued by making this great outlook sound even better. “Our largest customers are giving us increased longer-term visibility to ensure we have operational capacity and service support in place for their ramps,\" he added.\n\n\"Based on this visibility, we expect strong growth momentum to be carried into 2027.”\n\nTo put it all in perspective, we can look at the complete Q2 guidance versus what analysts expected. The numbers come from the Bank of America research note shared with TheStreet.\n\nMetric\n\nManagement Guidance (Q2 2026)\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nBank of America\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$7.65 Billion (±$500M)\n\n$7.03 Billion\n\n$6.85 billion\n\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS\n\n$2.64 (±$0.20)\n\n$2.29\n\n$2.20\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n\n~49.3%\n\n48.5%\n\n48.4%\n\nThe great outlook makes even more sense when we consider what the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) estimates for 2026.\n\n“The global semiconductor industry posted its highest-ever annual sales in 2025, nearly hitting $800 billion, and global sales in 2026 are projected to reach roughly $1 trillion,” stated SIA CEO John Neuffer.\n\nFollowing the report’s release, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya and his team updated their view on AMAT stock.\n\nRevenue of $7.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.64\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 49.3%\n\nThe team estimates the company will gain approximately 1% in 2026, thanks to cyclical growth, leadership in DRAM, advanced packaging, and deposition and conductor etch systems.\n\nAnalysts raised their non-GAAP EPS estimates for 2026 and 2027 by 18% and 24% to $11.86 and $14.57, respectively.\n\nApplied Global Services could grow at a rate higher than the typical low-double-digit pace through steady install base expansion, with all recurring revenue helping fund capital returns.\n\nApplied Materials captures more than 50% of the serviceable addressable market share in inflection points such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) and backside power delivery, where revenue opportunities increase by 30% versus FinFET .\n\nSystems' gross margins of 54% improved by 1% year over year and can expand further as Applied Materials prices to value.\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Amazon stock price target after earnings\n\nArya reiterated his buy rating for AMAT stock and raised the price target to $420 from $350, based on his 29 multiple of his price-to-earnings ratio estimate for calendar year 2027.\n\nHe said the multiple is at the high end of Applied Materials’ historical trading range of 10 to 30. The numbers are justified by the potential for wafer fab equipment outgrowth in 2026 and 2027, Arya added, and they remain at a discount relative to other large peers, given a more balanced growth profile and lower profitability.\n\nSlower-than-expected capital spending cycle\n\nDelay in memory capacity adds\n\nMarket share loss in deposition, implant, thermal, chemical mechanical planarization, etch, or process control segments\n\nDemand destruction in PCs and mobile as a headwind\n\nMerger and integration risk, along with macro headwinds\n\nApplied Materials reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, regarding allegations that certain customer shipments to China between November 2020 and July 2022 did not comply with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, based on the company’s misunderstanding of the applicability of those regulations.\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $252.5 million to the Department of Commerce. The U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have closed their related investigations without action.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApplied Materials announced that Samsung Electronics will join the new, $5 billion Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization (EPIC) Center in Silicon Valley. According to Applied Materials, its EPIC Center will open this year as the world’s largest facility for collaborative research and development of semiconductor process technology and manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe co-development programs at the EPIC Center will be designed to speed up the development and deployment of next-generation semiconductor technologies. The joint research and development programs will work on new materials and process technologies for chips, multiple manufacturing processes (nodes) ahead of the current generation.\n\nApplied Materials introduced new deposition, etch, and materials-modification systems that boost the performance of logic chips at 2nm and beyond. The transition to GAA transistors is a pivotal moment for the industry, as it will enable energy-efficient computing needed to deliver more powerful AI chips.\n\n“The rapid progress of AI is pushing compute performance to the limit, and breakthroughs in computing begin with the transistor,” said Dr. Prabu Raja, president of the Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials.\n\n“To keep pace in the angstrom era, Applied is delivering materials engineering breakthroughs that improve energy-efficient compute. Together, these new systems extend Applied’s longstanding leadership in driving major transistor and wiring inflections, while helping customers accelerate their chip roadmaps to keep up with the blistering pace of AI.”\n\nRelated: Bank of America resets Qualcomm stock price target after earnings\n\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 13, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "It has been just under a year since digital storage giant Western Digital spun off flash storage specialist Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) , and the latter has turned into one of the hottest stocks on the market since its separation.\n\nShares of the company -- which specializes in NAND flash storage solutions for smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, automotive applications, wearable devices, and data centers -- have shot up a stunning 1,400% since the spin-off. Investors may now be wondering whether it is worth holding this semiconductor stock after its red-hot rally.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's take a closer look at Sandisk's long-term prospects and check whether it can deliver more upside over the next three years.\n\nWe have already seen that Sandisk's storage solutions are used across multiple applications. The edge devices market, which includes PCs and smartphones, is its largest business segment, accounting for 55% of its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Jan. 2, 2026). Sandisk's revenue from this segment shot up by 63% from the year-ago period, to just under $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company pointed out that the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the PC and smartphone markets is a major catalyst for this segment. That's not surprising, as generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs are equipped with higher storage to support local AI tasks. Importantly, shipments of these devices are poised to accelerate at a healthy pace over the next three years.\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that generative AI smartphone shipments could jump to 912 million units in 2028, up from 234 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, generative AI PC shipments are predicted to jump to 138 million units in 2028, up from just over 24 million units in 2024. So, Sandisk should continue to witness healthy demand from these end markets in the long run.\n\nAt the same time, investors should note the strong growth Sandisk is witnessing in data centers, where demand for fast flash storage solutions such as solid-state drives (SSDs) is increasing. SSDs offer much faster data transfer speeds and greater energy efficiency than hard-disk drives (HDDs). Specifically, SSDs can be a hundred times faster than HDDs, enabling instant data transfer at higher bandwidths.\n\nOf course, HDDs are significantly cheaper than SSDs. However, the shortage of HDDs is pushing AI infrastructure companies toward SSDs. SSDs can also reduce the total operating costs of data centers thanks to their energy efficiency and faster data transfer rates.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see the data center business moving the needle in a bigger way for Sandisk over the next three years, especially considering the massive investments in this space . The company reported a 76% year-over-year increase in data center revenue in the previous quarter to $440 million. This impressive growth seems sustainable, as Sandisk's storage solutions have been qualified for use by a second hyperscaler customer, and it is on track to bring additional hyperscalers on board.\n\nSandisk notes that it will begin recognizing revenue from its new hyperscaler customers in the next few quarters. All this explains why analysts are expecting a sharp spike in Sandisk's top line. Specifically, its revenue is expected to more than double in the current fiscal year from $7.36 billion in the previous one, followed by another significant jump in the next fiscal year.\n\nSandisk isn't just enjoying healthy top-line growth. The supply-constrained nature of the memory market is also pushing prices higher. According to market research firm TrendForce, NAND flash memory prices could jump by 55% to 60% in the ongoing quarter, up from the earlier estimate of 33% to 38%.\n\nWhat's more, NAND flash memory is expected to remain in short supply through 2028, driven by a jump of almost 3x in demand by that time as compared to 2024 levels. This should pave the way for a robust jump in Sandisk's earnings, following a projected 1,220% increase in the current one to $39.45 per share. As the following chart indicates, Sandisk's earnings could almost double in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that the flash storage market is likely to sustain solid growth beyond next year, Sandisk could see a big jump in its earnings after the next couple of years. But even if we assume a conservative 25% increase in its bottom line in fiscal 2028, its earnings could jump to just over $95 per share within the next three years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings by the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25 points toward a stock price of $2,375, which is over 4x Sandisk's current stock price. So this AI stock has the potential to become a multibagger over the next three years. That's why investors should consider buying it hand over fist, as it is trading at just 15 times forward earnings right now.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Where does the time go? Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRKA) (NYSE: BRKB) first earnings report in the post- Warren Buffett era is almost upon us. Buffett, of course, is still on the scene as chairman, but as of Jan. 1, he's no longer CEO.\n\nRegardless, Berkshire -- which hasn't formally set a date for disseminating its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results -- will likely unveil them toward the end of February. Here's my take on whether it's wise to load up on the popular stock in the run-up to the event, or sit on the sidelines.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nBerkshire's business comprises its sizable insurance operations (anchored by the well-known Geico), full or partial stakes in private enterprises, and its vaunted equity portfolio.\n\nWhile the insurance end of the company is the foundation of its business and that portfolio of private companies is considerable, it's the equity holdings that get the most attention. The major development recently with this daunting lineup is Berkshire's chunky stock sell-offs , such as Apple and Bank of America , and its accumulation of highly liquid assets (specifically cash and cash equivalents and U.S. Treasuries).\n\nSince the end of the first quarter of 2024, shortly before it started seriously unloading its stakes in those companies, to Q3 2025's quarter-end, the stack of those liquid assets has doubled and then some from $182 billion and change to more than $377 billion. This figure, by the way, exceeds the under $330 billion market cap of the entire equity portfolio at present.\n\nThe consensus on Berkshire's strategy is that its cash and other liquid holdings are a kind of flexibility tool that will come in handy when more stock market bargains present themselves. And snapping up shares of undervalued companies is one of the activities the company excels at.\n\nGiven that, I'd say we'll see impressive growth in its equity portfolio over the coming quarters and years, and, as ever, it'll lift the value of Berkshire as a whole. I think the company's stock is a smart buy in advance of earnings.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

As we head into a long weekend with U.S. markets closed for Presidents’ Day on Monday, investors are trimming risks.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturer Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) surged following a positive Q1 earnings report and optimistic outlook. Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) soared 26.64% to close at $17.73 after earnings beat expectations.\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) was also among today’s top gainers after heavy losses yesterday. The stock increased 16.46% to $164.32 in spite of disappointing Q4 revenue as Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) posted gains. In the Dow, defensive healthcare name Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) slipped ahead of next week’s earnings.\n\nJanuary’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, released today, came in lower than expected. Inflation slowed to 2.4% while core inflation, which doesn’t include food and energy, rose by 2.5%. The news went some way to reassure investors and showed that housing inflation was cooling.\n\nAI replacement fears have dominated the markets this week. What started as a concern that automation could undermine software as a service (SaaS) stocks rapidly spread into other sectors. However, some analysts say the dramatic sell-off was an overreaction.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/de055c4e-1a0f-32f0-aa22-54dabc56a9f1/3-reasons-why-ethereum-is.html",
      "Content": "Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) 7.3% move over the past 24 hours, as of 4:00 p.m. ET, is one I think investors are right to cheer today. After all, we haven't had many days in which Ethereum has trended higher over the past four months or so. Thus, a move of more than 7% higher in such a short time frame is worth celebrating.\n\nNow, as is the case with most rallies in the cryptocurrency sector, it's a sea of green today, with most tokens moving in the same direction. That said, among the five largest digital assets in the market, Ethereum is leading the way with today's move.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's dive into three key factors shaping today's direction of travel for those invested in Ethereum.\n\nWhen a world-class asset like Ethereum gets beaten down to the extent it has over the past few months (falling more than 55% from its peak), one could argue that this crypto token has become too cheap to ignore for some investors. In concert with an inflation reading from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released this morning (which showed lower-than-expected inflation), investors increasingly believe that a weakening jobs market and continued improvements in inflation could lead to lower interest rates over time. That would be broadly beneficial for those who want to remain invested in more speculative, high-growth investments like Ethereum.\n\nAnother key factor to consider is Ethereum's stalwart status as the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) player in the market. Given Ethereum's outperformance when risk-on sentiment proliferates, due to its incredible network effects and importance in derivatives markets, this broad-based rally today has an outsize impact. That's not a coincidence, in my view.\n\nThat brings me to my final point: a mass unwinding of bearish bets on Ethereum, mainly in the perpetual futures and derivatives markets, has led to a buying surge that has propelled this token higher faster than many of its peers. I'd expect this rally to continue, so long as momentum remains strong, and this token doesn't enter overbought territory. Given how oversold Ethereum has become in recent weeks, I think it would take a much larger and protracted rally for such a scenario to unfold.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "If you haven't looked at Nokia (NYSE: NOK) stock lately, you might be surprised. Most consumers remember Nokia as a leading cellphone company that found itself pushed aside by the introduction of the smartphone.\n\nHowever, Nokia has reinvented itself as a telecom equipment company, and the tech stock now trades at its highest levels in more than 10 years. Despite those gains, its long-term growth may have barely begun; here's why.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nSo, what happened? The one reason investors have suddenly become interested in the stock is because of a deal with Nvidia . The two companies will create AI-RAN (radio access network) products powered by Nvidia's GPUs. This will tie Nvidia to the cellular network infrastructure business and give Nokia a competitive edge in optimizing 5G and later 6G networks.\n\nThanks to this deal, Nokia's stock is surging, with the stock rising by almost 50% over the last year.\n\nMoreover, despite breaking out of a range, the stock may not stop moving higher, although it now sells at a 54 P/E ratio, with a forward earnings multiple of just 19.\n\nThe falling forward multiple is likely a product of the anticipated revenue growth, which usually boosts profits. Analysts forecast a 7% increase in revenue this year, and they expect that revenue growth rate to rise to 15% in 2027. Accelerating revenue growth tends to be bullish for stocks over time, giving prospective shareholders time to buy. Additionally, faster revenue growth tends to lead to expanding multiples, which could serve as another tailwind for the stock.\n\nHence, between the rising demand for Nokia's Nvidia-powered equipment and the company's improving financials, Nokia stock could become a surprising long-term winner .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nokia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nokia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Friday, February 13, 2026\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), as well as two micro-cap stocks Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. (NGVC) and Team, Inc. (TISI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Near-Perfect CPI Report Brings Pre-Markets Near Breakeven\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\nMicron Technology&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past six months (+227.9% vs. +59.6%). The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI)-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end markets are driving top-line growth.\n\nThe surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value.\n\nMicron Technology&rsquo;s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, rising operating costs and a massive increase in capital expenditure pose a downside risk to Micron&rsquo;s near-term profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> )\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+22.3% vs. +7.5%). The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. It is refocusing on the core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading businesses through restructuring and scaling back its consumer banking footprint, which will likely support top line growth in the upcoming period.\n\nHowever, its high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. The rising expense base due to ongoing investments in technology and elevated transaction-based costs during periods of higher client activity might hamper near term profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the company's expansion in the private equity credit market is expected to diversify revenues and will support its growth over the long run. Further, a solid liquidity profile will support its capital distribution activities.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here >>> )\n\nVerizon&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+17.7% vs. -1.3%). The company recorded solid fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The buyout of Frontier Communications has accelerated its broadband expansion plans.\n\nVerizon appears to be at a critical inflection point and remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures for steady 5G deployment, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and fiber densification.\n\nHowever, the spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage surging data traffic. High spending on promotional activities to attract customers is straining Verizon&rsquo;s profits. Weakness in the wireline business is another concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>> )\n\nShares of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage have underperformed the Zacks Food - Natural Foods Products industry over the past six months (-32.8% vs. -25.9%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $595.64 million is facing risks which include margin pressure from inventory shrink, long-term lease obligations limiting flexibility, macro and supply chain vulnerabilities, and weak digital capabilities. Trading at just 0.43X EV/sales and 6.02X EV/EBITDA, valuations are attractive versus peers.\n\nNevertheless, Natural Grocers posted a 14% YoY rise in Q1 FY26 net income to $11.3M, with EPS up to 49 cents, supported by disciplined cost control and 1.6% revenue growth. EBITDA rose to $22.6M, highlighting operational leverage despite modest top-line gains. Strong liquidity ($23.2M cash, $67.6M credit availability) and a debt-light balance sheet support a 25% dividend hike and active buybacks.\n\nNatural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage is expanding cautiously with 6&ndash;8 new stores planned, enhancing brand reach in underserved markets. Its 900+ private-label SKUs support margin and loyalty, reinforcing differentiation in the competitive organic segment. Operating efficiency improved.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage here >>> )\n\nTeam&rsquo;s shares have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Maintenance Service industry over the past six months (-34.3% vs. +2.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $65.64 million is facing structural leverage, high interest burden, persistent GAAP losses, working capital drag, MS segment margin volatility and contingent legal liabilities. Upside hinges on sustained margin expansion, cash flow conversion and progress toward double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nNevertheless, Team benefits from a large, durable opportunity in critical infrastructure services, supported by aging assets, regulatory requirements, and sustained energy, midstream and industrial demand. The third-quarter 2025 results showed solid execution, with 6.7% year-over-year revenue growth, strong momentum in the IHT and MS segments, and meaningful margin expansion,driven by pricing, mix and cost discipline.\n\nCanadian operations are recovering, validating localized commercial strategies, while an integrated service model supports lifecycle-driven growth and operating leverage.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Team here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT), Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) and Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC).\n\nMark Vickery\nSenior Editor\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

      "Content": "World stock indexes struggled for inspiration Friday as investors remained cautious after heavy selling of companies seen vulnerable to AI deployment and concerns about tech sector valuations more broadly.\n\nA lower-than-expected US consumer inflation reading meanwhile modestly improved the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts \"as investors increasingly envision a trio of rate cuts by year-end,\" said a note from Interactive Brokers economist Jose Torres.\n\n\"But it's been a bumpy ride for equities today, as bulls and bears wrestle with the tailwinds of monetary policy accommodation prospects against the backdrop of a crumbling AI narrative,\" Torres added.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 percent gain following a choppy session.\n\nUS equities struggled for momentum a day after major indices lost more than one percent.\n\nMost of the large companies in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" fell Friday, with Apple and Nvidia both shedding more than two percent.\n\nIn Europe, Paris dropped 0.4 percent at the close, with L'Oreal shares falling four percent after the cosmetics giant posted sales below analyst expectations, fueling fears of weakness for its luxury brands and performance in the key Chinese market.\n\nLondon's FTSE 100 ended up 0.4 percent and the DAX advanced 0.25 percent in Frankfurt.\n\nAmid growing concerns over the massive investments by AI heavyweights, investors also worry that software, logistics and even real estate companies will see their operations upended by artificial intelligence advances.\n\n\"The concerns that have revolved around AI disruption in the software segment have spread,\" noted Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.\n\nA sense of calm had descended on trading floors early in the week after recent asset-wide volatility, helped by forecast-busting US jobs figures.\n\nHowever, growing concern about the hundreds of billions spent on AI infrastructure -- and the bundles more announced in the past few days -- have fanned speculation about when, if ever, companies will see a return.\n\nThe release of new tools this month that can perform crucial tasks in a range of fields, including legal, sales and marketing, has meanwhile compounded those jitters -- hammering companies worried about competition.\n\n\"The AI scare trade has shocked investors in 2026 and has brought a significant amount of market dislocation,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n- Key figures at around 2115 GMT -\n\nNew York - Dow: UP 0.1 percent at 49,500.93 (close)\n\nNew York - S&P 500: UP 0.1 percent at 6,836.17 (close)\n\nNew York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.2 percent at 22,546.67 (close)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.4 percent at 10,449.91 (close)\n\nParis - CAC 40: DOWN 0.4 percent at 8,311.74 (close)\n\nFrankfurt - DAX: UP 0.3 percent at 24,914.88 (close)\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 1.2 percent at 56,941.97 (close)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 1.7 percent at 26,567.12 (close)\n\nShanghai - Composite: DOWN 1.3 percent at 4,082.07 (close)\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1876 from $1.1871 on Thursday\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.3654 from $1.3622\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 152.71 yen from 152.74 yen\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 86.96 pence from 87.14 pence\n\nBrent North Sea Crude: UP 0.3 percent at $67.75 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 0.1 percent at $62.89 per barrel\n\nbur-jmb/des",

      "Content": "Let’s get this straight: I don’t want to bash any ETF issuer. I want to bash the idea that investors need to chase leverage – and that they need even more new tools to do that.\n\nIn my experience, this phenomenon is what drives events like Thursday’s new launch from Direxion, a pioneer of issuing funds that help individual investors act more like traders.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor active traders, Direxion added to its line of leveraged and inverse tools this week, introducing four new 2x leveraged ETFs that aim to deliver 2x the daily return of an individual stock. Added to the roster, and to the market’s overwhelming number of these types of ETFs:\n\nDirexion Daily ASML Bull 2X ETF (ASMU)\n\nDirexion Daily BABA Bull 2X ETF (BABU)\n\nDirexion Daily MRVL Bull 2X ETF (MRVU)\n\nDirexion Daily SOFI Bull 2X ETF (SOFA)\n\nMy concern is not about these funds themselves. It is twofold.\n\nFirst, that they will be misused by investors. I know, that’s their problem, not mine. but when someone gambles on a leveraged index ETF on a basket of stocks, even a basket of 10-20 of them, there’s some diversification. Not here.\n\nOf course, the key to using this is position sizing, which I talk about here a lot. When I buy a leveraged ETF, I typically buy it at the same exposure level I would an unleveraged ETF. So if I were buying ASMU, I’d ask myself, “what would be my starting position in ASML if I were buying it right now?” Then I’d divide that percentage of my portfolio and/or dollar amount in half. That’s how much ASMU I’d buy.\n\nSecond, this reminds me of many past market eras, where the product flood gates opened, as if to “ring a bell at the top.”\n\nLet’s close here by charting the underlying stocks of those four new Direxion 2x bull ETFs.\n\nASML (ASML) is indecisive but overvalued technically. And selling at more than 50 trailing earnings.\n\nAlibaba (BABA): Chart is leaking, $120 is a potential target. Chinese stocks’ latest rally was the typical 50% in a flash, then a skittish few months. Look at the chart to see how this has become routine for Alibaba. That makes it a good candidate for both leveraged long and short ETFs.\n\nMarvell (MRVL): Any stock with a 10-month range from $120 to $50 a share is ripe for leveraged ETFs, right? But only if you know your limits.\n\nSoFi (SOFI): Easily the worst of the bunch, currently. This chart has $10 written all over it. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is in worse shape than it has been at any point in this most recent descent. Translation: sellers are piling on, and rallies are being sold. Hard.\n\nRemember what destroys capital most, based on Wall Street’s long history. It is not missing upside, it is getting hammered by using leverage like a gambling tool.\n\nThis is a time when the temptations are greater than they’ve ever been for retail investors. Learn risk management.\n\nIronically, in this article focusing on four new 2x leveraged long ETFs, the charts here make more of a case to start screening for funds that rise when stocks fall.\n\nAnd since these stocks cannot be singled out, since there are hundreds that look like this, there are plenty of ways to start developing defensive investing skills.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monolithic-power-systems-links-cfo-211316162.html",
      "Content": "Find your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (NasdaqGS:MPWR) announced the planned retirement of long-serving CFO and Executive Vice President Bernie Blegen.\n\nThe company named an interim CFO to support continuity in its finance leadership during the transition.\n\nAlongside the leadership changes, Monolithic Power Systems approved a higher quarterly dividend following robust quarterly results.\n\nFor investors watching Monolithic Power Systems at a share price of $1,155.93, these updates connect leadership change directly to recent business performance. The stock has gained 23.5% year to date and 66.5% over the past year, with a 218.9% return over five years. This performance places the latest board and management decisions under a brighter spotlight.\n\nThe higher dividend and CFO transition, together with what the company describes as robust quarterly results, reflect management's current view of the business. For you as a shareholder or prospective investor, this combination of capital return and leadership reshuffle is a useful moment to reassess how Monolithic Power Systems fits within your broader portfolio and risk tolerance.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Monolithic Power Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Monolithic Power Systems.\n\nDoes the team leading Monolithic Power Systems have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\n\nThe leadership change at Monolithic Power Systems comes at a time when the business is reporting strong revenue but materially lower earnings compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2025 were US$751.16 million versus US$621.67 million a year earlier, while net income for the quarter and full year fell versus 2024. At the same time, the Board lifted the quarterly dividend from US$1.56 to US$2.00 per share and guided first quarter 2026 revenue to US$770 million to US$790 million. For you, that pairing of a higher cash payout with a long-planned CFO retirement and interim appointment signals confidence in the balance sheet and cash generation, but it also puts more attention on how the next finance leader will manage costs and capital allocation. With Bernie Blegen staying on to support the handover and Rob Dean stepping in as interim CFO after nine years as Corporate Controller, the company is emphasizing continuity rather than a reset in direction.\n\nThe earnings beat and record quarterly revenue line up with the existing narrative that AI data center, enterprise data and automotive demand are important drivers of Monolithic Power Systems’ growth story.\n\nLower net income and earnings per share versus last year raise questions about how much margin pressure rising investment, supply chain costs or mix shifts could create, which is a potential counterpoint to expectations of sustained earnings leverage.\n\nThe dividend increase and CFO transition are not central in the existing narrative, which focuses more on end markets and capacity build out, so income-focused capital returns and leadership succession may not be fully reflected in that story.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Monolithic Power Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\nProfit margins of 22.1% are lower than 81% last year, which shows a large compression in profitability that you may want to understand in more detail.\n\nThere has been significant insider selling over the past 3 months, which can sometimes signal that management and directors are reducing exposure at current levels.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings to grow 21.26% per year, which, if achieved, would support the view that Monolithic Power Systems can continue to build on its current scale.\n\nThe company reports strong demand in enterprise data, communications and automotive, which helps diversify away from a single end market and can reduce reliance on any one customer segment.\n\nFrom here, you may want to watch three things in particular. First, how the interim CFO and eventual successor explain margin trends and capital allocation, including the sustainability of the higher US$2.00 quarterly dividend. Second, whether revenue in early 2026 stays within or above the guided US$770 million to US$790 million range, especially in AI data center and automotive segments where Monolithic Power Systems competes with peers such as Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and ON Semiconductor. Third, how insider trading activity evolves now that compensation related stock sales have been disclosed. Together, these factors will help you judge whether the leadership transition is simply a well managed handoff or a point where the company’s risk and return profile starts to change.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Monolithic Power Systems, head to the community page for Monolithic Power Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and investors are scrambling to lock in the biggest winners. Yet even in a crowded AI trade, few names have delivered like Micron Technology (MU). The memory-chip giant has ridden the AI wave to record highs, with MU stock delivering massive returns over the past year. Surging demand for memory chips from AI hyperscalers racing to build out massive data center capacity has been the primary engine behind Micron’s remarkable ascent.\n\nBut every rally eventually meets a reality check. Micron’s momentum recently hit a speed bump earlier this week after reports suggested that Samsung Electronics is nearing certification from Nvidia (NVDA) for its next-generation HBM4 chips. High-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized chip designed to move enormous volumes of data at ultra-fast speeds, is a critical component inside AI accelerators.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nNvidia relies heavily on HBM for its AI processors, making supplier approvals a closely watched development on Wall Street. Now, with Samsung reportedly preparing to begin mass production of its next-generation HBM chips earlier than expected, competitive dynamics in the AI memory space could shift quickly.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant’s progress threatens to add meaningful pressure on Micron, which is a key supplier of advanced memory products used across data centers and AI infrastructure. Given this latest development, should you buy, sell, or hold MU stock? Let's take a closer look.\n\nBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology stands at the center of the global memory market, supplying the chips that quietly power today’s data-driven world. The company designs and manufactures a broad portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory products that sit inside everything from cloud data centers to smartphones and connected devices.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on engineering expertise and manufacturing scale, Micron plays a critical role in enabling AI workloads and other compute-intensive applications. From large-scale data centers to edge devices and mobile platforms, its memory and storage solutions form the backbone of systems that process, store, and move vast amounts of information every day. With a market capitalization of roughly $465 billion, Micron has grown into a semiconductor heavyweight.\n\nShares dipped about 2.8% on Feb. 9 following news surrounding Samsung, but that pullback barely dents what has been an extraordinary run. Over the past year, the stock has skyrocketed an eye-popping 336%, leaving the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) — up just 12% over the same stretch — far in the dust. After touching a record high of $455.50 last month, Micron now sits only about 9% below that peak, underscoring just how powerful its AI-fueled rally has been.\n\nWhile Micron has delivered a breathtaking rally, its valuation remains far from excessive. MU stock trades at roughly 12.6 times forward earnings, a sharp discount to the sector median of 23.6 times. For a company powering the AI memory boom, that gap suggests investors are still paying a relatively modest price for its growth trajectory, even after an extraordinary run.\n\nMicron kicked off fiscal 2026 with a strong quarter. In its Dec. 17 earnings report, the company crushed both top- and bottom-line expectations, posting revenue of $13.6 billion, up 57% year-over-year (YOY) and comfortably ahead of the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. The results marked Micron’s third-straight quarter of record revenue, powered by a 69% surge in DRAM sales and a 22% increase in NAND revenue.\n\nDRAM alone generated $10.8 billion, accounting for 79% of total sales, while NAND contributed $2.7 billion, or 20%. Notably, total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, HBM and data center revenue, and revenue across each business unit all reached new records. Cloud memory sales climbed to $5.28 billion, doubling YOY, while core data center revenue rose 4% annually to $2.38 billion.\n\nThe company said performance across both major segments was driven by higher pricing. Profitability also followed a similar growth trajectory. Adjusted gross margin came in at 56.8%, up from 39.5% in the year-ago quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS soared a stunning 167% YOY to $4.78, crushing the Street’s $3.78 estimate.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron struck an optimistic tone for Q2 fiscal 2026, projecting revenue of around $18.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.42. Management expects strong AI-driven demand across data centers and edge computing to continue, even as supply constraints are likely to persist through 2026, a backdrop that could further reinforce pricing strength.\n\nDespite intensifying competition, Wall Street’s conviction in Micron remains firmly intact. MU stock carries a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, with 33 out of 42 analysts calling it a “Strong Buy,” six assigning a “Moderate Buy” rating, and just three recommending a “Hold.”\n\nEven after its powerful run, optimism hasn’t faded. While MU has already surged beyond its average price target of $345.97, the Street-high target of $500 implies that there could still be roughly 21% upside ahead. That's a sign that many analysts believe the AI-driven momentum is far from over.\n\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI are both currently riding the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom. But with Supermicro facing margin pressure and NVIDIA offering far stronger profitability metrics, could NVDA now be the better investment? Let’s take a closer look –\n\nThe rise in data center capital spending has led to stiff competition between NVIDIA and its peers, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC. However, despite the challenges, NVIDIA managed to post solid quarterly results consistently, banking on the rapid progress in AI. Quarter after quarter, NVIDIA’s performances were commendable due to the increasing demand for its chips, including the latest Blackwell architecture and cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNVIDIA’s revenues jumped 62% year over year and 22% sequentially to $57 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2026, according to investor.nvidia.com. In fact, the company expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to come in at nearly $65 billion, with a plus or minus 2%. And why not? Thawing trade tensions between the United States and China are expected to support NVIDIA’s sales. The U.S. government has approved the shipment of NVIDIA’s H200 AI chips to China, while Chinese authorities have permitted their sale to selected customers.\n\nAI is significantly increasing demand for hardware, which is likely benefiting Supermicro. The company’s Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) has seen growing adoption among AI clients, offering a comprehensive package that includes integrated servers, networking, storage, cooling, software and related services. This momentum has translated into robust revenue growth, with its fiscal second-quarter 2026 sales climbing 123% year over year to $12.7 billion, easily exceeding analysts’ expectations of $10.4 billion, according to ir.supermicro.com.\n\nCEO of Supermicro, Charles Liang, added that Supermicro is scaling its AI server and storage capabilities and that its DCBBS helps customers deploy AI infrastructure faster and cost-efficiently, positioning the company to gain from the next wave of AI demand. Management remains bullish about Supermicro’s sales outlook, expecting fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues to reach $12.3 billion, and full-year net sales to hit $40 billion or more.\n\nDespite Supermicro’s rapid rise in revenue growth, ongoing pressure on its gross margins for some time has remained a concern. So, Supermicro earns less profit per dollar of sales. This is largely because, acting as an intermediary between NVIDIA and cost-conscious customers, its products have offered limited differentiation in a highly challenging, commoditized market.\n\nNonetheless, Supermicro’s gross margins dropped to 6.3% in fiscal second-quarter 2026 from 11.8% in the same quarter last year and 9.3% in the fiscal first quarter of 2026. Such low margins indicate that the company may face difficulties in generating profits once operating expenses are considered. In contrast, NVIDIA continues to demonstrate strong profitability, with its gross margin increasing to 73.4% in fiscal third-quarter 2026 from 72.4% in the fiscal second quarter of 2026, alongside steady revenue growth.\n\nNVIDIA, anyhow, consistently delivered stronger profits than Supermicro, reflected in its return on equity (ROE) of 99.2% compared with SMCI’s 17.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSupermicro, meanwhile, has a debt-to-equity ratio of 66.9%, higher than NVIDIA’s 6.3%, suggesting greater financial risk and increased exposure to economic headwinds.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTherefore, NVIDIA clearly stands out as the better stock to buy at this time, thanks to robust demand for its advanced chips and improving trade relations. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Supermicro has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick addressed the licensing requirements governing Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) sales of its advanced AI chips to China during a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nLutnick stated that Nvidia must adhere to the detailed licensing terms for the sale of its second-most-advanced AI chip, the H200, to China, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\nHe explained that the terms, which were developed in collaboration with the State Department, are detailed and non-negotiable.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\n\nBefore the IPO: How One Company Quietly Locked Up 500+ Iconic Character Rights\n\nReportedly, Nvidia had not agreed to the proposed conditions that would prevent China’s military from gaining access to the chips.\n\nThe U.S. agreed to permit Nvidia to sell its AI chips to China after a trade truce between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea last October.\n\nDespite President Trump’s approval of Nvidia’s export of H200 chips to China, the sale is still awaiting final clearance from the U.S. government, pending a national security review .\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nWhile Nvidia waits, Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba Group Holding Ltd . (NYSE: BABA ) has introduced its self-developed high-end AI chip through its T-Head unit, aiming to reduce reliance on Nvidia.\n\nThis move could have significant implications for Nvidia’s market share and potential revenue in China.\n\nIn December, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang secured a deal with President Trump to reopen Nvidia’s market presence in China, which Huang views as a potential $50 billion opportunity.\n\nHowever, the formal approval, granted in January, has yet to result in final clearance for H200 chip shipments.\n\nDespite these delays, China’s industry ministries have reportedly approved the import of the first batch of H200 chips, with initial authorizations granted to three major Chinese internet companies.\n\nHowever, the National Development and Reform Commission is still finalizing the terms.\n\nSee Also: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nAs a result of the delays, Chinese AI firms have resorted to purchasing more expensive black-market hardware or lower-performing domestic alternatives, such as Huawei’s Ascend series .\n\nResellers reported that black-market servers with 8 H200 GPUs are now commanding a 50% price premium.\n\nGlobal demand for AI hardware continues to outpace supply, further exacerbating the issue. Chinese tech firms have placed large orders for the H200, leading Nvidia to push Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd . (NYSE: TSM ) to increase production.\n\nOrders from Chinese customers far exceeded available stock, prompting Nvidia to scale up chip production in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nRead Next: Designed for investors with strong market convictions, REX Shares builds ETFs for income, leverage, and tactical positioning — explore the lineup.\n\nPhoto by JRdes via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

      "Content": "Wall Street may argue all about the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, but big tech's spending plans in global AI infrastructure are too large to ignore, right now. Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWith a significant portion of this spending already locked in through data center permits, power contracts, and supply agreements, core AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are likely to benefit from the near-term demand.\n\nHere's why stocks of these two companies can go parabolic in the coming years.\n\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, refers to AI as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" The company estimates global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of 2030. With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nBroadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\n\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\n\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects. This revenue growth trajectory can become even steeper if the company's backlog converts as expected or faster, and it has a few new multiyear client wins.\n\nHence, Broadcom can see parabolic growth even at current elevated valuation levels.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-boom-defense-backlogs-2-190000716.html",
      "Content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently projected global GDP growth of approximately 3.3% for 2026, reflecting steady expansion supported in part by continued corporate investment in digital infrastructure and advanced technologies. Labor market data further supports this resilience. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently reported that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 in January 2026, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.3%. The labor force participation rate was 62.5%, signaling a broadly stable employment environment.\n\nWithin this macro backdrop, hiring momentum remains firm across aerospace and defense, technology and digital services, with electronics among the faster-growing segments.\n\nAs per Deloitte’s recent industry projection report, the global semiconductor industry is expected to reach $975 billion in annual sales in 2026, a historic peak fueled by an intensifying AI infrastructure boom.\n\nTaken together, steady global growth, resilient labor markets and sustained technology investment create a constructive setting for equity markets. In this environment, AI-linked infrastructure and healthcare innovation stand out as two sectors offering clear earnings visibility and structural support heading into mid-2026.\n\nBelow are the two sectors that we expect to outperform the broader market this year, supported by strong demand drivers and favorable earnings momentum.\n\nAI-driven capital expenditure remains a core earnings catalyst in 2026. Hyperscalers, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, continue allocating substantial budgets toward AI data centers and cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association projects global semiconductor sales to approach $1 trillion in 2026, implying 26% industry growth, driven primarily by advanced logic and high-bandwidth memory tied to generative AI workloads. This underpins earnings visibility for GPU and accelerator suppliers such as NVIDIA NVDA and foundry leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor TSM. Equipment vendors, including ASML ASML and Applied Materials AMAT, also benefit from leading-edge node expansion. While TSM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NVDA, ASML and AMAT carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe industrial sector is supported by sustained defense spending, commercial aerospace backlog strength and accelerating electrification investment. U.S. national defense spending has remained above $800 billion annually in recent fiscal years, providing multi-year revenue visibility for prime contractors. This supports substantial funded backlogs at companies such as Lockheed Martin LMT, which exited 2025 with a record $194 billion backlog and RTX, which reported a $268 billion backlog, signaling extended revenue streams. LMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nBeyond aerospace and defense, electrification and grid modernization remain powerful structural drivers. Companies such as Eaton and Siemens continue to highlight data center power demand, transmission upgrades and energy transition investments as key growth catalysts. Collectively, these factors provide tangible backlog visibility and earnings support heading into mid-2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-potential-steel-aluminum-rollback-would-be-latest-tariff-reversal-amid-broader-affordability-push-185956950.html",
      "Content": "A significant tariff concession may be on the horizon, as the Trump administration acknowledged Friday that it could scale back some tariffs on goods containing steel and aluminium.\n\nA Friday report from the Financial Times outlined the White House's plan to reduce tariffs on some products made with the metals, from ovens to drink cans. Trump's team has responded that any decision isn't final, but this potential concession would be the latest among more than half a dozen moves to lower tariffs over the past three months.\n\nThe changes range from a reduction of food tariffs to a deescalation of tensions with trading partners to new tariff plans with exclusions so wide that they are expected to have little impact on consumers' pocketbooks.\n\nThe administration's shift in its tariff approach has been apparent since last November, when affordability emerged as a potent political issue that led to Republican election losses that month.\n\nAnd these moves have already had some apparent effects. Friday's cooler-than-expected inflation reading saw some politically sensitive food prices in decline.\n\nThe price of coffee — a key area of White House focus — fell 0.9% between December and January. Similarly in focus have been prices for beef and veal, with those prices down by 0.4% over the same stretch. That came as the overall Consumer Price Index showed a price increase of 0.2% in January from a month earlier.\n\nRead more: January CPI breakdown: Gas prices ease, housing costs remain elevated\n\nThe move also comes as a political backlash to tariffs is evident, even among Republicans. Earlier this week, six GOP lawmakers crossed party lines to reject Trump's tariffs on Canada.\n\n\"This may be an indication that President Trump's trade policy is moving into a new, more nuanced phase,\" international trade lawyer Ted Murphy of the firm Sidley Austin wrote in a note to Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nMurphy added that an initial tariff phase — defined in his view by big tariffs, quickly imposed — is being gradually replaced by a recognition \"that, at least in some cases, expanding tariffs may actually do more harm than good.\"\n\nA possible action on some steel and aluminium tariffs would represent perhaps the sharpest pivot yet.\n\nSteel and aluminum tariffs have been a priority for Trump stretching back to his first term and were some of the earliest new tariffs announced last year when he returned to office. Trump team visits to US steel plants that they say are being bolstered by these tariffs have also become a regular feature of administration travel.\n\nThe response on Friday from the Trump administration was largely to downplay the move.\n\nIn a CNBC appearance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent didn't deny that some changes could be in the works, but said it remains up to Trump and described the potential changes as \"clarification on some incidental objects.\"\n\nYet a wide array of goods could see price relief if the move goes forward — from washing machines to ovens to pie tins to drink cans — and would quite literally hit home for many consumers.\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nFriday's news came after months where the White House has offered a variety of step-backs around tariffs, all in apparent concessions to affordability worries.\n\nOn Nov. 14, grocery store tariff carve-outs were announced, including exclusions on a wide array of agricultural tariffs on items from beef to coffee to pineapples.\n\nThat was followed by tariff reductions on goods from specific countries. Brazilian food products also saw significant new exclusions in November after Trump had imposed 50% tariffs on imports.\n\nThe administration has also downplayed tensions with China in recent months ahead of an April summit. Recent months have also seen a deal with India, which cut many tariffs from 50 to 18% across a range of goods. A new deal with Taiwan , which also saw some lower duties, was announced this week.\n\nElsewhere, long-promised tariffs were revealed to be less than initially promised.\n\nTrump unveiled semiconductor tariffs in January that were notable for their limited scope , with exclusions for entire companies and chips earmarked for internal US consumption.\n\nThat means most consumer electronics — from Apple's iPhone on down — have often managed to dodge tariffs so far in Trump's second term, diminishing expectations that any change there is forthcoming.\n\nIt has been a similar story with pharmaceutical tariffs. Initial promises of 100% or higher tariffs on those goods have been replaced in recent months with a drug pricing deal that has ensured major drugmakers are excluded from tariffs, likely for the next three years.\n\nBen Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

      "Content": "Micron (MU) posted 57% year-over-year revenue growth and 28.1% profit margins as AI demand and supply shortages pushed prices sharply higher.\n\nMicron is shipping HBM4 chips with nearly $2B in Q4 revenue. Big tech plans over $700B in AI infrastructure spending for 2026.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) surged 466% over the past year while Seagate (STX) jumped 2.5% on memory chip shortages driving industry momentum.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nIt won't come as much of a surprise if you have been closely watching the market that shares of Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) climbed 4% over the past week, coinciding with a noticeable shift in retail investor sentiment on platforms like Reddit and X from neutral to very bullish. The memory chip maker has surged 338% over the past year, driven by AI infrastructure demand and persistent supply shortages that are pushing memory prices sharply higher. Micron's 57% year-over-year revenue growth and 28.1% profit margin reflect how tight supply and surging AI demand are creating a perfect storm for memory manufacturers.\n\nMentions of Micron on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets have surged recently, with users sharing bullish commentary and massive-gain posts. Sentiment jumped from 32 (bearish) on February 10 to 88 (very bullish) by February 13, a remarkable reversal that followed Morgan Stanley raising its price target from $350 to $450. One popular post titled \"$6k->$54k\" captured the FOMO energy driving retail interest, with the trader celebrating their successful options play on Micron's recent surge.\n\n$6k->$54k\nby\na user in\nwallstreetbets\n\nAnd there are real reasons to be optimistic:\n\nMicron is shipping HBM4 chips in volume with nearly $2 billion in Q4 revenue\n\nContract pricing has climbed 86% since December with room to double again\n\nBig tech companies are expected to spend over $700 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026\n\nIf you're spending time watching Micron make new highs almost daily, you are not alone. The broader data storage industry is experiencing explosive growth as global memory chip shortages drive prices higher. Western Digital ( NASDAQ:WDC ) has surged 466% over the past year, while Seagate Technology ( NASDAQ:STX ) jumped 2.5% on positive industry outlooks. Morgan Stanley notes that DRAM prices could double from current levels while still remaining below spot prices, signaling how constrained supply has become. For investors watching the AI infrastructure buildout, memory manufacturers like Micron are positioned at the center of a massive spending wave that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

      "Content": "Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) reported positive free cash flow (FCF) for the latest quarter ending Jan. 24, 2026, albeit lower than last year. Nevertheless, its FCF margin is still strong, and despite higher capex, management's guidance was for higher earnings.\n\nAs a result, analysts have higher target prices for CSCO stock. For example, Yahoo! Finance now reports that the average of 26 analysts' price targets is $87.86. That's 14% higher than today's price.\n\nDespite a Blistering Start to the New Year, the Smart Money is Still Riding with Intel (INTC) Stock\n\nExxon Mobil’s Options Heat Up—31 Unusually Active Contracts Signal Key Trading Setups\n\nOXY Earnings Play: Using Puts to Get Paid While You Wait\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nCSCO is trading at $76.87 , down from a recent peak of $86.78 on Feb. 9, just before the Feb. 11 earnings release.\n\nBased on its strong FCF and FCF margins, despite higher AI-related investments and capital expenditures (capex), Cisco Systems' stock has good upside. This article will show why and a conservative way to play CSCO.\n\nCisco reported that its fiscal Q2 revenue (ending Jan. 24, 2026) was up 10.3% to $15.3 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) rose faster, +11%.\n\nHowever, its operating cash flow (OCF), which includes all cash flow before capital expenditures (capex), was down from $2.24 billion last year to $1.82 billion.\n\nNevertheless, that still represented 11.8% of its quarterly revenue, albeit lower than last year's 16 OCF margin and 21.% in the prior quarter. This can be seen on page 17 of its slide deck:\n\nHowever, after higher capex spending, its Q2 FCF was $1.539 billion (10.0% of revenue) compared to $2.03 billion last year (14.5% FCF margin), according to Stock Analysis.\n\nMoreover, over the trailing 12 months (TTM), its FCF was still strong ($12.24 billion), representing 20.73% of TTM revenue. That was down less from the prior year's 23.6% FCF margin.\n\nAs a result, based on management's higher revenue forecasts for this year, we can expect that FCF could be higher over the next 12 months (NTM).\n\nFor example, management guided that this year it expects revenue to range between $61.2 billion and $61.7 billion (see page 4 of its earnings release). The midpoint of $61.45 billion is 8.5% higher than last year's $56.65 billion revenue.\n\nIn fact, analysts' forecasts are higher. Seeking Alpha shows that 19 analysts project $61.56 billion for the year ending July 2026, and $64.93 billion for the following fiscal year. That implies that over the next 12 months (NTM) revenue could rise to $63.245 billion , up 11.64% over FY 2025.\n\nAs a result, if we assume that Cisco Systems could maintain around 21% FCF margin (slightly higher than its TTM 20.73% margin), FCF could rise to almost $13.3 billion:\n\n$63.245 billion NTM revenue x 0.21 = $13.28 billion NTM FCF\n\nThat would be over $1 billion higher than its LTM FCF of $12.24 billion, or +8.5%.\n\nAs a result, CSCO's value over the next 12 months (NTM) could be higher. Here's why.\n\nRight now, Cisco's stock has a market capitalization of $302.456 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. As a result, its FCF yield on a trailing 12-month (TTM) basis is just over 4%:\n\n$12.24b TTM FCF / $302.456 b mkt cap = 0.0405 = 4.05% FCF yield\n\nAssuming its FCF yield improves to 4.0% over the next 12 months, the market value could rise to $332 billion:\n\n$13.28 NTM FCF / 0.04 = $332 billion NTM mkt cap\n\nThat's $30 billion higher than todays mkt cap or about 10% higher.\n\nIn other words, even before share buybacks, which have been strong at Cisco, its price target (PT) is 10% higher:\n\n$76.87 x 1.10 = $84.56 PT (i.e., +10%)\n\nThat is even lower than Yahoo! Finance's survey PT of $87.86, and Barchart's mean survey PT of $87.15 per share. Moreover, 18 analysts surveyed by AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst write-ups, show an average PT of $98.23. These surveys average $91.06 , or +18.5% higher.\n\nThe bottom line is that CSCO stock could be worth between 10% to 18.5% more than today's price.\n\nOne way to conservatively play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in one-month expiration periods. That way, an investor can get paid while setting a potential lower buy-in point.\n\nFor example, look at the March 20, 2026, expiration period. It shows that the $72.50 strike price put, over 5% lower than today's price, has a midpoint premium of $0.87 per put contract.\n\nThat means a short-seller can make $87 immediately after securing $7,250 with their brokerage firm and placing a “Sell to Open” trade order for this contract.\n\nThat represents a one-month yield of 1.20% (i.e., $87/$7,250). The worst that can happen is CSCO falls to $72.50 or lower, and the collateral is used to buy 100 shares at that price.\n\nThis could result in an unrealized capital loss. But the breakeven point is $71.63 (i.e., $72.50-$0.87), which is 6.8% lower than today's price. So, it provides a good potential entry point.\n\nMoreover, less risk-averse investors could use the premium to help buy longer-dated in-the-money (ITM) CSCO call options. That way, they can gain upside in CSCO stock that is potentially greater than buying CSCO shares. I have discussed this in other articles.\n\nThe bottom line is that Cisco Systems' stock looks cheap here, and shorting OTM puts and buying ITM calls are conservative ways to play CSCO.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Instead, the worry is about AMD's ability to compete in the rapidly rising market for artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nLuria said that performance at scale depended on more than just chip characteristics, even if AMD's Instinct MI300 GPUs seem to do well on technical benchmarks. Nvidia is ahead of the game when it comes to sophisticated networking, software integration, and ecosystem support, which are all things that large AI training clusters need.\n\nThe expert said that AMD was behind in AI accelerators and that big AI developers still relied largely on Nvidia systems for heavy workloads.\n\nEven if the company is neutral, the overall mood on Wall Street is still favorable, and many analysts still give AMD buy recommendations because they think the company has a lot of room to develop in the long run.",

However, he warned of a persistent memory crunch, noting DRAM costs rose 50% last quarter and nearly doubled again sequentially, calling the imbalance structural rather than temporary.",

But Netflix is down 38.6% from its 52-week high at the time of this writing, while Oracle has fallen a staggering 56.5%.\n\nNetflix's market cap is now just $346.9 billion as I write this, and Oracle is at $410.4 billion -- a far cry from joining Nvidia , Alphabet , Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Broadcom , Meta Platforms , Tesla , Berkshire Hathaway , and Walmart on the list of U.S. companies with at least $1 trillion in market cap.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHere's why both growth stocks are under pressure, and if they are still buys now.\n\nLike many software stocks, Oracle is undergoing a steep sell-off as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts the once seemingly intractable moat of the software-as-a-service business model. But Oracle's investments are mainly centered around building out data centers for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), as well as multicloud data centers that embed its database service into third-party clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nThe market has become (rightfully) more skeptical about capital-intensive AI spending. Especially for companies like Oracle that are depending heavily on a handful of customers to fulfill order volume.\n\nOracle exited its most recent quarter with $99.98 billion in notes payable and other non-current borrowings (basically long-term debt) compared to just $19.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Oracle announced a plan to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds in calendar year 2026 to fund the rapid expansion of OCI and meet contractual demand from companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Meta Platforms, TikTok, and xAI. The funding will come from a mix of selling at-the-market equity, convertible preferred securities, and bonds. None of these options is good, as the interest rate won't be ideal on the bonds, and Oracle's stock price is already so beaten down.\n\nTaking on debt isn't the worst thing in the world if a company is generating enough cash flow to pay it off. But Oracle reported negative $13.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2026 compared to $9.5 billion in FCF in the same quarter from a year ago. Oracle has gone from being a high-margin cash cow to a capital-intensive money pit while it expands OCI. And that has investors worried that Oracle is betting too big on AI.\n\nThe silver lining is that spending should decline in the coming years as Oracle's capital expenditures decrease and it starts realizing revenue from its backlog. But the company is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in AI spending.\n\nIf Oracle comes even remotely close to its forecast for $144 billion in fiscal 2031 (calendar year 2030) OCI revenue, the company will likely be worth far more than $1 trillion. But it could also continue underperforming the broader indexes if it doesn't get its balance sheet under control.\n\nUnlike Oracle, which has legitimate issues challenging its investment thesis, Netflix is selling off mainly for valuation concerns and mixed reactions to its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) .\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix's valuation has come down significantly since the stock peaked at a split-adjusted intraday high of $134.12 on June 30, 2025.\n\nTrading at just 26.3 times forward earnings, Netflix is within striking distance of the S&P 500 's forward P/E of 23.6. But Netflix is a far better company than the typical S&P 500 component.\n\nNetflix generates high margins and is growing at a solid rate. The company's cash flow means it can fund its content spending without relying on debt, giving it a clear runway for compounding over time.\n\nNetflix has had tons of success with both live-action and animated series and movies, from Stranger Things to its most successful film ever, KPop Demon Hunters .\n\nAdding Warner Bros. Discovery assets would broaden Netflix's content suite and allow it to pair HBO and HBO Max programming as a dual offering with Netflix or simply bundle it into a high-octane streaming subscription.\n\nWarner Bros. is a smart acquisition, but Netflix doesn't need it to succeed. Which is why the stock is still a buy even if the deal falls through.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) have struggled so far this year, with the stock down more than 18% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 32% below its 52-week high. Despite the significant pullback, unfavorable industry dynamics around memory supply could weigh on QCOM’s earnings. With sentiment already negative, the possibility of the stock revisiting its two-year low of $120.80 cannot be ruled out.\n\nQualcomm delivered better-than-expected Q1 financial numbers. Revenue of $12.3 billion rose 5% YoY and slightly exceeded consensus expectations, reflecting steady demand across key end markets. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue with a strong EBT margin, supported by higher unit volumes and a favorable product mix.\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThe core Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) business posted revenue of $10.6 billion, driven by demand across smartphones, automotive, and IoT markets. Handset revenues within QCT climbed to a record $7.8 billion, benefiting from the launch cycle of premium flagship devices. IoT revenue grew 9% YoY to $1.7 billion, driven by consumer and networking applications, while automotive revenue reached $1.1 billion, up 15%, as adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis platforms accelerated.\n\nIts adjusted EPS of $3.50 rose 3% YoY and surpassed expectations.\n\nThe market’s negative reaction to QCOM stock reflects management’s weak guidance. Management guided for second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65, both below Wall Street expectations. This raised concerns that near-term headwinds will likely weigh on its growth.\n\nThe most significant challenge impacting Qualcomm's growth is the uncertainty in global memory markets. Surging demand for memory solutions, led by AI data centers, has diverted supply away from smartphones, driving higher prices for handset manufacturers. This has been especially disruptive in China, where OEMs are responding by scaling back production plans and tightening inventory management.\n\nWhile Qualcomm maintains that the fundamental demand environment for handsets remains intact, highlighting better-than-expected global shipments in the December quarter and a strong Snapdragon design win pipeline, the near-term outlook remains cautious. OEMs are adjusting build plans downward to manage cost pressures, and Qualcomm is seeing reduced chipset orders as a result.\n\nFor the second quarter, Qualcomm forecasts QCT handset revenues of $6 billion, reflecting a sharp sequential decline. While management expects QCT handset revenues to return to their prior growth trajectory once memory supply and pricing normalize. However, until visibility into memory availability improves and OEM production plans stabilize, Qualcomm’s earnings may remain under pressure. That uncertainty helps explain why the shares have continued to slide despite solid underlying execution.\n\nWhile the company’s handset revenues could continue to face near-term pressure, management has pointed to meaningful strength in other businesses.\n\nQualcomm’s QCT IoT revenue is projected to grow by a low teens percentage YoY. That growth will likely be driven by expanding demand across both industrial and consumer IoT applications. Further, the momentum in the QCT automotive business will be sustained. Qualcomm anticipates YoY revenue growth accelerating to more than 35% in the second fiscal quarter.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, QCOM stock appears inexpensive at 16.3 times forward earnings. However, that multiple fails to attract. Analysts expect QCOM’s earnings to decline 14.7% in fiscal 2026, and there is still limited visibility into a meaningful reacceleration in fiscal 2027. With handset revenues under pressure and earnings momentum weakening, Qualcomm's stock could still remain under pressure.\n\nAnalysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on QCOM stock. However, if memory constraints persist longer than expected, the risk of Qualcomm shares drifting toward their two-year low increases.\n\nOn the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Read more here .\n\nThe AI infrastructure arms race has reached a staggering scale. Hyperscalers are collectively pouring approximately $700 billion into AI CapEx in 2026. Amazon ( Nasdaq: AMZN) just announced $200 billion in planned spend, Alphabet ( Nasdaq: GOOGL ) is projected $185, Meta Platforms ( Nasdaq: META ) up to $135 billion, and Microsoft will reveal an updated capex target closer to summer.\n\nThat kind of spending makes it \"hard to bet against Nvidia,\" as one analyst put it. But here's the paradox: Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock has struggled despite this thesis, up just 0.24% year-to-date while the broader AI infrastructure buildout accelerates. Let's explore what's going on and why stocks like Broadcom ( Nasdaq: AVGO ), Micron ( Nasdaq: MU ), and Bloom Energy ( Nasdaq: BE ) have seen stronger recent gains.\n\nHyperscaler spending is concentrated among the mega-cap tech giants. Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon are deploying massive capital into AI infrastructure and cloud computing, with Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS competing for AI workload dominance. Together, these hyperscalers are funding the largest technology infrastructure expansion in history.\n\nSecondary spending comes from 'neoclouds' like CoreWeave and Nebius , while other projects like sovereign AI data centers add even more fuel to the rapidly growing spending pie.\n\nNvidia should be the obvious winner. The company has seen explosive Data Center growth, with AI revenue exponentially growing across training and inference. Yet the stock trades at $186.94, essentially flat for the year. The market seems to be pricing in execution risk or questioning whether $700 billion in CapEx translates to sustained GPU demand beyond the initial buildout phase.\n\nPersonally, I'm betting this is a mistake on Wall Street's part. NVIDIA is my largest personal position, and I own it in the $500,000 portfolio I manage as part of 24/7 Wall Street's AI Investor Podcast. Since we first recommended a buy of NVIDIA on 9/12/2024, shares are up 55%. That's a healthy return in a year and a half for stock that was considered 'overbought' at the time by most of the media.\n\nStill, you might be wondering what other stocks benefit from this $700 billion buildout beyond NVIDIA. Here are some stocks to consider.\n\nThe $700 billion wave creates opportunities across the entire supply chain. These picks-and-shovels plays are seeing explosive growth as AI infrastructure spending accelerates.\n\nBroadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) is capturing custom chip demand, with strong AI semiconductor revenue growth driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. The stock is up 41% over the past year. We first recommended it in the $500,000 Portfolio on October 11, 2024 and later re-recommended it. Both recommendations are up more than 80%.\n\nBroadcom shares are down 4% year-to-date despite its primary customer Google announcing $185 billion in capex, a number that was more than 50% above analyst expectations.\n\nOptical components are seeing explosive growth. Lumentum ( NASDAQ:LITE ) has seen strong data center and long-haul momentum, with optical circuit switches and co-packaged optics as next growth engines. The stock has surged 637% over the past year.\n\nWe first recommended it in the AI Portfolio on 11/8/2024 and shares are up 590% since. We've pounded the table since, such as when we brought on an optics expert on our March 28th episode last year titled 'These Optical Stocks Could Be Set to Ride an Optical Supercycle.'\n\nMemory is another winner. Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) has seen AI memory demand driving record results as the only US-based memory manufacturer. The stock is up 353% over the past year. Once again, we recommended Micron before its most significant gains. Our January 17th recommendation last year is now up 292%.\n\nPower infrastructure plays are emerging. Bloom Energy ( NYSE:BE ) has seen strong momentum addressing AI data center power demands, with product backlog growing significantly. The stock has jumped 492% over the past year. Bloom Energy isn't a stock we've recommended in our $500,000 AI Portfolio, but it could make the cut when we record our next episode.\n\nIf you're looking for other stocks that could benefit from the $700 billion buildout, make sure to subscribe to the AI Investor Podcast. On our next episode, we're issuing a series of new buy recommendations. It's absolutely free to subscribe and get each new idea. So far, our average recommendation is up 87%!\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

Once again, we recommended Micron before its most significant gains. Our January 17th recommendation last year is now up 292%.\n\nPower infrastructure plays are emerging. Bloom Energy ( NYSE:BE ) has seen strong momentum addressing AI data center power demands, with product backlog growing significantly. The stock has jumped 492% over the past year. Bloom Energy isn't a stock we've recommended in our $500,000 AI Portfolio, but it could make the cut when we record our next episode.\n\nIf you're looking for other stocks that could benefit from the $700 billion buildout, make sure to subscribe to the AI Investor Podcast. On our next episode, we're issuing a series of new buy recommendations. It's absolutely free to subscribe and get each new idea. So far, our average recommendation is up 87%!\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

      "Content": "Astera Labs ALAB shares have plunged 30.8% since it reported fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday. The decline was due to a slight decrease in non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2025, which dropped 70 basis points sequentially to 75.7% compared to the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base.

Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc.

      "Content": "Though it may not feel like it amid recent concerns surrounding technology, particularly in software and some other stocks tied to the broader AI frenzy, many in the trade are still crushing it in the new year, delivering big-time gains.\n\nAnd concerning the all-star performers, three stocks that sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER reflect the top three hottest S&P 500 stocks in 2026. What’s been driving the positivity?\n\nSanDisk shares have been melting higher in 2026 months as its role in the broader AI frenzy finally comes into focus. The stock is up more than 160% in the new year alone, by far reflecting one of the strongest moves we’ve seen.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating SNDK’s performance in 2026 relative to the broader Zacks Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI is driving a huge surge in storage demand, which is where SanDisk comes in. NAND prices are rising rapidly, with AI data centers, cloud providers, and edge devices all needing more high-speed storage.\n\nThe company’s revenue acceleration is evident in recent quarterly releases, with sales of $3.0 billion climbing 61% year-over-year throughout its latest period. Its current fiscal year (ends in June) has also confirmed the favorable demand backdrop, with the current $14.1 billion estimate up a staggering 50% over the last year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWDC shares impressively reflected one of 2025’s top-performing S&P 500 stocks as well, with the fresh year already looking bright again. Western Digital provides scalable, sustainable technology for hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers, providing cutting-edge innovation that’s expected to drive the next generation of AI-driven data workloads.\n\nUp nearly 70%, the stock has been red-hot in the fresh year, underpinned by favorable quarterly results that have revealed a massive opportunity for the company.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s cash-generating abilities have seen a nice boost thanks to the environment, with free cash flow of $653 million throughout its latest period up by a triple-digit 125%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s critical to note that Western Digital also holds roughly a 20% stake in SNDK.\n\nTeradyne manufactures equipment used by other companies to test chips. Unsurprisingly, the fastest-growing segment here is chips for AI data centers and accelerators, and more complex chips mean greater test demand, with AI chips among the most complex right now.\n\nUp 60%, the stock has enjoyed a great year so far, particularly so relative to the Zacks Technology sector, which is essentially flat YTD.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTeradyne’s sales growth has been incredible over recent periods, as shown below. Recent quarterly results came in above the high-end of previous guidance, further explaining the positivity behind shares in the new year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile pockets of the broader Technology sector, particularly software, continue to get hammered in 2026, all three above – SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER – haven’t seen hardly any negativity, with all three benefiting in a huge way either directly or indirectly from the AI demand environment.\n\nNotably, all three stocks sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "After some share-price ups and downs, Cisco Systems (CSCO) now trades at a fairly reasonable 21.44 times historic earnings.\n\nCisco reported a respectable 10% year-on-year net income gain in Q2 FY2026.\n\nCSCO stock should have a clear path to $150, but keep an eye on Cisco’s expenditures.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nSometimes favored but other times reviled, Cisco Systems ( NASDAQ:CSCO ) is a technology firm that never ceases to garner interest. Cisco stock is always in motion, but the burning question is whether the share price will be higher or lower in five years' time.\n\nAt the very least, bulls and bears must concede that Cisco has come a long way since the dot-com-era days. Today, Cisco is a strong networking/communications technology market contender that's deeply immersed in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe pessimists might declare that Cisco peaked in the dot-com days, but that's an overly harsh assessment. Frankly, it's fine that some folks underestimate Cisco as this leaves the door open to significantly higher share prices in the coming years.\n\nOver the past year and a half, CSCO stock has been on a rocket ride that undoubtedly put some short sellers out of commission. There's been a recent price pullback which we'll discuss in a moment, but overall, the momentum has been decidedly to the upside.\n\nIt's probably a good thing that Cisco stock dipped from $85 to $75 as this will allow for some digestion of the gains. Notably, Cisco's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 21.44x, which is 8.43% below the sector average.\n\nTo put it another way, Cisco appears to be reasonably valued and you don't have to worry about buying at the top now. On its multi-year trajectory, CSCO stock has the potential to double to $150 in five years -- and wouldn't you rather get in at $75 than at $85?\n\nBy the way, Cisco stock also happens to pay a decent dividend for a large-cap technology stock. At the moment, Cisco's forward annual dividend yield is nearly 2%, and our five-year share-price forecast doesn't include the dividend-reinvestment opportunities.\n\nThe naysayers can complain about a CSCO stock \"rug pull\" from $85 to $75 if they want to. Yet, it's really an opportunity instead of a problem if Cisco is doing well from a financial standpoint.\n\nIndeed, value seekers ought to consider it positive news that Cisco stock sank despite perfectly good financial results. Consider, for example, that Cisco grew its second-quarter fiscal 2026 revenue by 10% to $15.3 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Cisco's management projects current-quarter revenue in the range of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion. Thus, the $15.3 net revenue recorded in the second fiscal quarter probably wasn't just a fluke.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Cisco's Q2 FY2026 non-GAAP net income increased 10% year over year to $4.1 billion. It looks even better if we use GAAP measurements and then observe that Cisco's net income grew 31% to $3.2 billion.\n\nThere's nothing objectionable in Cisco's headline numbers, so it's the bears' burden to explain why CSCO stock shouldn't at least hit $150 in five years. Moreover, Cisco is upping the ante in AI integration with its recent acquisitions of enterprise AI platform company NeuralFabric Corp. and AI software business EzDubs, Inc.\n\nRemember, the market will find excuses to rotate out of stocks temporarily even if the companies are in good shape. Technology stocks have been shaky lately, but that's not a Cisco-specific problem. If and when the market collectively decides to buy NASDAQ 100 stocks again, Cisco stock should move higher.\n\nIf there's a topic that investors ought to pay more attention to, it's financial outlays. Too much time is spent on revenue growth and not enough is spent on cost controls.\n\nWe can use Cisco's Q2 FY2026 data as an example of what investors need to keep tabs on. Sure, Cisco's revenue and income grew substantially on a year-over-year basis, but it's important to watch out for what I call \"expenses creep.\"\n\nIn this day and age, technology firms' financial outlays on AI technology continue to creep higher, quarter after quarter and year after year. That's fine as long as revenue growth continues at its current pace for these companies.\n\nChecking in on Cisco during the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company's GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year over year to $6.2 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, those expenses grew 6% to $5 billion.\n\nThis isn't a cause for panic right now, but it's definitely something to monitor closely. If Cisco starts to creep up its expenditures into the double digits, the shareholders should call for better fiscal discipline.\n\nSo, feel free to keep track of Cisco's operating expenses to make sure that the AI arms race isn't too costly for this company. That said, the upside potential remains strong for CSCO stock and unless circumstances change drastically, a five-year price target of $150 is absolutely attainable.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

This includes a roughly 13% gain over the past week.\n\nLooking at slightly longer periods, GlobalFoundries has returned about 18% over the past month and 47% over the past 3 months, inviting closer scrutiny of what is currently priced into the shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for GlobalFoundries.\n\nThat recent momentum sits within a mixed track record, with a 32.09% year to date share price return and a 12.84% 1 year total shareholder return, contrasted against a 27.49% 3 year total shareholder return decline.\n\nIf GlobalFoundries has you thinking about where else chip related trends might show up, it could be worth scanning 34 AI infrastructure stocks as a starting point for other ideas.\n\nSo, with recent gains, analyst targets close by and mixed longer term returns, is GlobalFoundries still offering value, or are you looking at a stock where the market is already pricing in future growth?\n\nGlobalFoundries’ most followed valuation narrative puts fair value at about $40.28, which sits well below the recent $48.70 share price, so the story behind that gap matters.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\n\nWant to see what kind of revenue build, margin lift and future earnings multiple have to come together to support that fair value gap?

      "Content": "Western Digital (WDC) shares surged 65% year-to-date through Thursday’s close. The company beat Q2 estimates with $3.02B revenue and $2.13 non-GAAP EPS.\n\nWestern Digital’s net income jumped 210% to $1.84B. Free cash flow more than doubled to $653M.\n\nWestern Digital targets 100TB hard drives by 2029 for AI workloads. The company authorized a $4B share buyback program.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nWestern Digital ( NASDAQ:WDC ) has delivered an exceptional start to 2026, with shares climbing 64.9% year-to-date through yesterday's close. The broader tech sector, measured by the Technology Select Sector SPDR ( NYSEARCA:XLK ), has slipped 0.68% in the same period.\n\nBest of all, Western Digital is now the second-best performer in the entire S&P 500, trailing only Sandisk's (Nasdaq: SNDK) incredible 166% jump. Not surprisingly, both stocks are rallying thanks to AI-driven demand.\n\nHowever, Western Digital's operational discipline and strategic positioning shouldn't be ignored.\n\nWestern Digital's fiscal Q2 2026 results, filed January 29, 2026, validated market enthusiasm. The company delivered revenue of $3.02 billion, beating the $2.95 billion consensus, while non-GAAP EPS of $2.13 topped estimates of $1.94.\n\nGross margin expanded to 46.1%, while operating income surged 6.57% year-over-year to $908 million. Net income jumped 210% to $1.84 billion, and free cash flow more than doubled, climbing 127.53% to $653 million.\n\nCEO Irving Tan framed the results around the company's core thesis: \"Western Digital's strong performance this quarter reflects our disciplined execution to meet demand in the AI-driven data economy, and the confidence our customers place in our ability to deliver reliable, high-capacity HDDs at scale.\"\n\nYear-over-year comps are more difficult as the company spun SanDisk off earlier in 2025, but the future looks bright. Wall Street sees Fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS at $8.86. In 2027, the Street is modeling growth up to $13.30. If current trends hold, those figures will likely underestimate Western Digital's earnings power.\n\nWestern Digital operates at the intersection of two powerful tailwinds: the explosion of AI-generated data and hyperscaler appetite for cost-effective, high-capacity storage. On February 10, 2026, Western Digital unveiled its AI storage roadmap at WD Innovation Day, targeting 100TB hard drives by 2029 through new UltraSMR and HAMR technologies. This represents a fundamental shift in how data centers will store massive datasets required for AI model training and inference.\n\nThe sector-wide momentum is undeniable. Seagate ( NASDAQ:STX ), Western Digital's primary competitor, has posted a 57% year-to-date gain.\n\nWestern Digital's Q3 guidance points to continued strength. The company expects revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, representing roughly 40% year-over-year growth. Analysts remain bullish, with 21 of 27 rating the stock a Buy or Strong Buy. Morgan Stanley ( NYSE:MS ) put a $369 price target on the stock, while Cantor Fitzgerald went higher at $420.\n\nThe company has also strengthened its balance sheet. In early February, Western Digital completed full redemption of its 4.750% Senior Notes due 2026, eliminating near-term debt maturities. It also authorized a $4 billion share buyback program, signaling management's confidence in sustained profitability.\n\nWestern Digital's 2026 start validates the company's transformation from a diversified storage player to a focused, high-margin provider of AI infrastructure. The rally has room to run if solid execution continues and hyperscalers keep building.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etfs-gain-us-taiwan-sign-151700576.html",
      "Content": "The landmark trade agreement signed between the United States and Taiwan on Feb. 12, 2026, has ignited a new wave of optimism for the island&rsquo;s industrial powerhouses. By reducing reciprocal tariffs from 20% to 15%, the deal directly lowers the cost of entry for Taiwanese high-tech exports &mdash; particularly semiconductors, generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts &mdash; into the world&rsquo;s largest economy.\n\nThis reduction effectively places Taiwan on a \"fair footing\" with other Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, removing the competitive disadvantage previously caused by \"Trump-era\" reciprocal duties.\n\nFor investors, this pivotal deal creates a significant tailwind for Taiwanese giants like Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and, by extension, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold heavy concentrations of them, as these companies remain poised for margin expansion and increased shipment volumes in the days ahead.\n\nBy holding a diversified basket of these firms, ETFs offer a direct route to capitalize on this improved competitive landscape without the risk of picking individual stocks.\n\nBefore suggesting these ETFs for your portfolio, let us delve a little deeper into the specifics of this trade deal and the prospects for Taiwanese companies, so you can make a more informed investment decision.\n\nThe U.S.-Taiwan relationship is far from simple, operating within a complex geopolitical framework.\n\nAs the United States steadily pushes for a &ldquo;Silicon Shield&rdquo; by reshoring 40% of the semiconductor supply chain to its shores, Taiwan leverages its dominance in AI hardware to secure more favorable trade terms.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the agreement effectively codifies the mutual dependency between the two nations, with the United States lowering trade barriers in exchange for Taiwan deepening its critical technology investments in America.\n\nThe deal includes an $84 billion commitment from Taiwan to purchase U.S. goods &mdash; including LNG, crude oil and aircraft &mdash; between 2025 and 2029, along with a $250 billion investment pledge by Taiwanese firms into U.S. manufacturing. Taiwan has also pledged to remove or reduce 99% of tariff barriers on U.S. goods, as well as provide &ldquo;preferential market access&rdquo; for U.S. exports, including autos, beef products and minerals (as per a CNBC press release).\n\nThis \"reciprocal trade\" framework, while aimed at narrowing the U.S. trade deficit, will add impetus to the booming Taiwanese economy by fueling the insatiable global demand for AI.\n\nBolstered by this deal, Taiwan&rsquo;s economy, which grew 8.6% in 2025, is expected to maintain its momentum despite global \"AI bubble\" fears. According to Fortune, this growth was largely fueled by a 78% surge in exports to the United States, backed by ballooning AI demand.\n\nNow that the tariff is reduced, more export volumes are expected to be registered this year, which should help Taiwanese \"enablers\" capture efficiency gains in the coming days.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, for those looking to capitalize on this transformation, the following ETFs offer the most direct exposure:\n\niShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EWT\n\nThis fund, with net assets worth $8.15 billion, offers exposure to 88 large and mid-sized companies in Taiwan. Its top three holdings include TSM (24.66%), Mediatek (4.72%) and Hon Hai Precision Industry HNHPF (4.56%).\n\nEWT has surged 37.5% over the past year. The fund charges 59 basis points (bps) as fees. It traded at a good volume of 6.98 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nFranklin FTSE Taiwan ETF FLTW\n\nThis fund, with net assets worth $706.3 million, offers exposure to 130 Taiwan large and mid-capitalization stocks. Its top three holdings include TSM (22.09%), HNHPF (6.35%) and Mediatek (6.25%).\n\nFLTW has soared 46.2% over the past year. The fund charges 19 bps as fees. It traded at a volume of 0.49 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nFidelity Emerging Markets Multifactor ETF FDEM\n\nThis fund, with net assets worth $448.1 million, offers exposure to 250 stocks of large and mid-capitalization emerging markets companies that have attractive valuations, high quality profiles, positive momentum signals, lower volatility than the broader emerging markets equity market, and lower correlation to the U.S. equity market. TSM holds the first position in this fund, with 10.30% weightage.\n\nFDEM has gained 30.6% over the past year. The fund charges 28 bps as fees. It traded at a volume of 0.20 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "ASML Holding ASML shares have surged 11.3% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 3.4%. ASML stock has also outperformed its peers, namely Lam Research LRCX and KLA Corporation KLAC, while underperforming Applied Materials AMAT in the same time frame.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of Lam Research, KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have returned 10.8%, 1.1% and 19.1%, respectively. This surge in stock price has also made ASML stock overvalued. ASML stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 12.66X compared with the sector average of 6.37X, which makes it overvalued at present, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of F.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow the question remains: Should the investors buy, sell or hold shares of this semiconductor manufacturing equipment player?\n\nSustained demand for artificial intelligence and high performance computing chips by global data centers, AI labs and hyperscalers has reinforced ASML’s long-term growth outlook as the company provides extreme ultraviolet (EUV) semiconductor lithography tools to chip manufacturers that enable them to accelerate capacity expansion.\n\nASML’s management on the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call noted that ASML’s customers have become more confident about medium-term AI demand, leading to stronger order intake and investment plans as chipmakers transition from 4-nanometer to 3-nanometer and prepare for the 2-nanometer transition.\n\nAs EUV intensity per wafer continues to rise, AI and HPC workloads are addressed more efficiently. In memory, robust demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM nodes is expected to tighten supply through at least 2026, further supporting EUV demand.\n\nASML is also benefiting from a growing installed base, which is driving high-margin service and upgrade revenues as customers increasingly view upgrades as the fastest way to add capacity. With a €38.8 billion backlog and reaffirmed long-term targets, ASML remains well-positioned to capitalize on the AI-led semiconductor investment cycle.\n\nFor 2026, ASML expects its revenues in the range of €34-€39 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 revenues is pegged at $43.31 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 17%.\n\nAlthough ASML faces competitive pressure from players like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA Corporation in the broader wafer equipment manufacturing market, ASML holds a near-monopoly in EUV technology.\n\nEUV is crucial for the world’s most advanced chips at 3nm and below; it benefits from extraordinary pricing power and strategic importance with major customers like TSMC, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML’s venture into sub-2nm production with High Numerical Aperture (High-NA) EUV systems is the next technological leap for chipmakers. This technology will provide ASML with long-term potential as the industry moves toward denser and more efficient chips. ASML’s High-NA machines will be central to that shift.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 earnings is pegged at $33.63, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20.3%. The consensus estimate has been revised upward in the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML’s unmatched EUV leadership, AI-driven demand visibility, and strong earnings momentum support a long-term bullish view, making this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock attractive at present.

      "Content": "ASML Holding ASML shares have surged 11.3% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 3.4%. ASML stock has also outperformed its peers, namely Lam Research LRCX and KLA Corporation KLAC, while underperforming Applied Materials AMAT in the same time frame.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of Lam Research, KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have returned 10.8%, 1.1% and 19.1%, respectively. This surge in stock price has also made ASML stock overvalued. ASML stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 12.66X compared with the sector average of 6.37X, which makes it overvalued at present, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of F.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow the question remains: Should the investors buy, sell or hold shares of this semiconductor manufacturing equipment player?\n\nSustained demand for artificial intelligence and high performance computing chips by global data centers, AI labs and hyperscalers has reinforced ASML’s long-term growth outlook as the company provides extreme ultraviolet (EUV) semiconductor lithography tools to chip manufacturers that enable them to accelerate capacity expansion.\n\nASML’s management on the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call noted that ASML’s customers have become more confident about medium-term AI demand, leading to stronger order intake and investment plans as chipmakers transition from 4-nanometer to 3-nanometer and prepare for the 2-nanometer transition.\n\nAs EUV intensity per wafer continues to rise, AI and HPC workloads are addressed more efficiently. In memory, robust demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM nodes is expected to tighten supply through at least 2026, further supporting EUV demand.\n\nASML is also benefiting from a growing installed base, which is driving high-margin service and upgrade revenues as customers increasingly view upgrades as the fastest way to add capacity. With a €38.8 billion backlog and reaffirmed long-term targets, ASML remains well-positioned to capitalize on the AI-led semiconductor investment cycle.\n\nFor 2026, ASML expects its revenues in the range of €34-€39 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 revenues is pegged at $43.31 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 17%.\n\nAlthough ASML faces competitive pressure from players like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA Corporation in the broader wafer equipment manufacturing market, ASML holds a near-monopoly in EUV technology.\n\nEUV is crucial for the world’s most advanced chips at 3nm and below; it benefits from extraordinary pricing power and strategic importance with major customers like TSMC, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML’s venture into sub-2nm production with High Numerical Aperture (High-NA) EUV systems is the next technological leap for chipmakers. This technology will provide ASML with long-term potential as the industry moves toward denser and more efficient chips. ASML’s High-NA machines will be central to that shift.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 earnings is pegged at $33.63, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20.3%. The consensus estimate has been revised upward in the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML’s unmatched EUV leadership, AI-driven demand visibility, and strong earnings momentum support a long-term bullish view, making this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock attractive at present.

The startup’s core tech is its Command family of generative AI models, which Cohere says are efficient enough to be deployed on limited GPUs — an attractive promise for enterprises looking to get a handle on cost and resource management.\n\nLast summer, Cohere launched North , a higher-level enterprise platform and AI workspace for secure, custom AI agents and workflows built on Cohere’s models.\n\nCohere’s CEO Aidan Gomez said last October that the startup may IPO “soon.” If “soon” means in 2026, Cohere may be contending against OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX/xAI, which are all reportedly weighing their own public debuts.\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to Cohere for comment.",

      "Content": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\n\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\n\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\n\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\n\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\n\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm sees a \"compounding execution moat\" for the company in leading edge manufacturing.",

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\n\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\n\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\n\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\n\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\n\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm sees a \"compounding execution moat\" for the company in leading edge manufacturing.",

      "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Analog Devices (ADI) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-analog-devices-adi-143004519.html",
      "Content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $9.97.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Investing.com -- D.A. Davidson initiated coverage of four major semiconductor names, AMD, Intel, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in notes to clients on Thursday, with only one receiving a Buy rating.\n\nAnalyst Gil Luria initiated coverage of the group, pointing to diverging competitive positions.\n\nOn Broadcom , D.A. Davidson stated that the company is “sitting on a shrinking iceberg” as hyperscalers increasingly favour customised accelerators.\n\nThe firm warned that the largest of customers could internalise more of their silicon stack, ultimately “pressuring supplier economics.” Luria believes Broadcom’s AI ASIC exposure does not justify “a premium multiple versus market leaders such as NVIDIA,” initiating the stock at Neutral with a $335 price target.\n\nIntel was also started at Neutral. D.A. Davidson said “it wouldn’t be an overstatement to claim that Intel is attempting one of the hardest resets in semiconductor history,” arguing the company must rebuild leading-edge process capability while proving itself as a third-party foundry.\n\nWhile noting “real developments” in the business, the firm said Intel remains “the ultimate ‘show me’ story,” and set a $45 price target.\n\nAMD received a Neutral rating as well. D.A. Davidson said AMD is “a marginal AI accelerator player … in the act of playing catch-up,” despite strength in CPUs. The firm initiated with a $220 price target.\n\nFinally, TSMC was the lone Buy. Luria said the company’s leading-edge execution represents “a durable, self-reinforcing advantage” as AI compute demand expands. He also highlighted “a compounding execution moat in leading edge manufacturing.” The analyst assigned TSM a $450 price target.\n\nRelated articles\n\nD.A.

      "Content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) just released an artificial intelligence (AI) networking chip that could reshape how the world's biggest data centers handle AI workloads. The Silicon One G300 delivers 102.4 terabits per second of switching capacity.\n\nThat's more than double what the previous generation could handle. The chip powers new systems designed specifically for massive AI clusters, where thousands of GPUs must constantly communicate.\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nHere's what investors should know about CSCO stock in light of the news.\n\nThe G300 chip tackles AI's biggest infrastructure problem. When training large language models or running AI inference at scale, data must be constantly moved between GPUs. Any delays or dropped packets can stall entire jobs, wasting expensive compute time.\n\nCisco's chip uses something called Intelligent Collective Networking. Think of it as traffic management for data. The chip has an industry-leading buffer that can absorb sudden bursts of traffic without dropping packets. It also continuously monitors the network and reroutes traffic around issues before they cause failures.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Cisco reports that the technology delivers 33% higher network utilization than traditional approaches. Job completion times drop by 28%. That means more AI tokens generated per hour from the same GPU hardware. For companies spending millions on AI infrastructure, those improvements translate directly to better returns on investment.\n\nCisco has built complete systems around the G300 that address AI's power and cooling challenges. The new Cisco N9000 and Cisco 8000 systems come in both liquid-cooled and air-cooled versions. The liquid-cooled systems achieve nearly 70% better energy efficiency. One new system delivers the same bandwidth as six older systems. That matters enormously as data centers struggle with power constraints, fitting more AI capacity in the same physical space while using less energy.\n\nCisco also introduced 1.6 terabit optics and new 800G linear pluggable optics that cut power consumption by 50% compared to older designs. Overall, switch power consumption drops by 30%, improving operational reliability and sustainability.\n\nCisco's management shared compelling numbers during recent investor conferences. The company took in $1.3 billion in AI infrastructure orders during just the first quarter of fiscal 2026. That's from hyperscalers alone. The figure doesn't include sovereign cloud providers, neoclouds, or enterprise customers.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, Cisco expects to take in at least double the $2 billion in AI orders from fiscal 2025, while AI-powered revenue should increase to $3 billion. Even more impressive, Cisco now has design wins at five of the six largest hyperscalers. In Q1 alone, the company won four new design wins across four different hyperscalers. These aren't one-time purchases, as design wins can generate orders for three-plus years. Four hyperscalers increased their orders with Cisco by more than 100% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That shows deepening relationships beyond initial trials.\n\nSilicon One gives Cisco real advantages. CFO Mark Patterson called it one of the company's \"most strategic assets.” The chip is also highly programmable. Customers can upgrade equipment with new features even after deployment. That protects long-term infrastructure investments and creates stickiness. Cisco now has a variety of Silicon One product families, covering everything from AI data centers to enterprise networks.\n\nThe hyperscaler business receives the most attention, but Cisco sees significant opportunities elsewhere. For example, the sovereign cloud and neocloud pipeline exceeds $2.5 billion. These customers want AI infrastructure but need local control over their data and operations. Cisco's relationships with partners such as HUMAIN position it well.\n\nEnterprise AI remains early, but could dwarf everything else. Cisco's partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) focuses on simplifying enterprise AI deployment. The companies offer validated reference architectures that remove complexity.\n\nPresident Jeetu Patel noted at Cisco's AI Summit that token generation will become \"one of the core currencies of every company and every country.\" Organizations that can generate AI tokens efficiently and cost-effectively will gain a competitive advantage.\n\nWhile AI grabs headlines, Cisco's campus networking refresh provides steady growth. The company has billions of dollars worth of installed switches approaching the end of support. These older systems pose security risks and can't handle modern AI workloads.\n\nCisco refreshed virtually its entire campus portfolio in June. The new switches incorporate AI and security directly into the fabric. Campus networking orders accelerated in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Adoption of new platforms is happening faster than previous product launches.\n\nThis isn't a one-quarter spike. The campus refresh will unfold over multiple years as enterprises modernize their networks to support AI-powered applications and agile workloads.\n\nCisco generated strong cash flow while investing heavily in AI. The company bought back $2 billion in CSCO stock during Q1 at an average price of $68. That shows management's confidence while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nGross margins held steady at around 68% despite the inclusion of a lower-margin hyperscaler business. The company manages its diverse portfolio to maintain profitability while growing revenue.\n\nOperating expenses are growing more slowly than revenue. Earnings are growing faster than the top line in every recent quarter and in the full-year guidance.\n\nOut of 24 analysts covering Cisco stock, 15 recommend a “Strong Buy,” one recommends a “Moderate Buy,” and eight recommend a “Hold” rating. That makes for a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating. The average CSCO stock price target is $86.90, which represents 16% potential upside from current levels.\n\nThe AI networking opportunity is massive, and Cisco has real technological advantages. Design wins at multiple hyperscalers validate the technology and create multi-year revenue streams.\n\nThe sovereign cloud and enterprise markets are just beginning. As AI moves beyond hyperscalers into broader deployment, Cisco's full-stack approach becomes even more valuable. Cisco's campus refresh also supports steady growth as the company scales its AI infrastructure. Security through Splunk adds another growth vector as customers prioritize protecting AI deployments.\n\nNear-term volatility is possible if AI spending pauses or memory costs spike. But Cisco's diversified business model and strong balance sheet can handle bumps. For investors who can handle some volatility, Cisco offers exposure to AI infrastructure growth at a reasonable valuation with dividend income while you wait.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

In the last year the stock has gained 8.1%.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for NXP Semiconductors investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver the last three years, NXP Semiconductors failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 9.0% (annualized).\n\nThis means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.7% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. The revenue drop of 3.4% is as underwhelming as some politicians. The only thing that's clear is there is low correlation between NXP Semiconductors' share price and its historic fundamental data. Further research may be required!\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNXP Semiconductors is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for NXP Semiconductors in this interactive graph of future profit estimates .\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of NXP Semiconductors, it has a TSR of 36% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nNXP Semiconductors provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 7% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NXP Semiconductors better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with NXP Semiconductors .\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "論壇中心／綜合報導\n台股封關氣勢如虹，台積電供應鏈個股表現尤其亮眼，資深分析師蘇威元在《財經週日趴》分享選股心法，他以去年12月推薦的沛亨(6291)為例，該股從175元漲到封關日的276元，短短兩個月就大漲58%，蘇威元強調，抓住飆股關鍵在於「題材要對、財報要爆發」，並掌握四大財務指標。\n蘇威元表示，想要抓到飆股，首先要選對產業族群，像是AI、矽光子、記憶體、PCB、散熱等，都是目前的主流題材。他以去年12月初推薦的沛亨為例，該股同時具備矽光子、記憶體與無人機三大題材加持，當時股價約175元，封關日攻上漲停板來到276元，漲幅高達58%。\n\n在財務面上，蘇威元建議投資人要關注四大指標：毛利率連續成長、營收年月雙增、本益比相對不高、以及EPS連續跳升。他強調，沛亨的毛利率從2025年第一季的30.18%，一路攀升至第三季的36.46%，呈現連續三季跳升，這種趨勢通常代表股價有很高的噴出機會。月營收方面，沛亨1月營收月增9.47%、年增77.54%，年月雙增表現亮眼。\n\n在籌碼面上，蘇威元建議觀察千張大戶或600張大戶的動向，搭配外資買進平均成本，當股價站上外資成本之後，往上攻的機會就很高。蘇威元也提醒投資人，雖然技術指標有助於選股，但股市投資仍存在風險，建議投資人在過年期間可以好好做功課，深入研究個股基本面，並依據自身風險承受能力審慎評估，切勿盲目追高，才能在開紅盤後穩健獲利。\n《民視新聞網》提醒您：內容僅供參考，投資人於決策時應審慎評估風險，並就投資結果自行負責。\n原文出處： 財經週日趴(影)／蘇威元：台積電概念股飆漲密碼 這四指標抓飆股一次賺58%\n更多民視新聞報導\n陳建全：安控大廠二刀流獲利傳奇 轉投資台積電狂賺8億！\n蘇威元:有成精密四劍齊發 台積電.記憶體.能源.SIC高毛利率動能強\n蘇威元:輝達菁英級隊友研揚 通吃機器人+智慧城市商機\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "[ FTNN新聞網 ]記者蔡曉容／綜合報導\n台股封關，投資人將時間和眼光轉向ETF。PTT 股板近期正熱烈討論野村投信發行的「野村臺灣新科技50」（00935）。該組合主打創新科技選股與高比例電子股配置，吸引投資人拿來與元大台灣50（0050）、富邦科技（0052）、凱基台灣TOP 50（009816）比較。\n原PO指出，00935以「臺灣創新科技50指數」作為追蹤標的，透過FactSet辨識創新科技產業，並以流動性、市值、研發費用占比、營益為正等條件篩選成分，最後以自由流通市值加權配置，單一持股上限30%、前五大成分股合計上限65%。最新成分股中電子產業占比高達99%，成立以來的指數報酬也位於臺灣50指數上緣。不過其0.435%的費率，相較0050的0.22%偏高，也成為討論焦點。\n\n部分投資人認為，00935的科技純度高、波動集中且成分股明確，直呼「這支很強」、「漲幅蠻常超越0050」。也有人分析其持股結構，包括大型電子權值股占比較高，因此視其為分散電子股的工具。有網友分享實際操作，表示已持有約20張，對績效頗為滿意。\n\n不過也有投資人質疑其費率偏高，策略能否長期勝出仍有疑問，有人認為不如直接買大型權值股，也有人指出0050內扣費用降至0.075%後更具吸引力。另有部分投資人偏好其他科技主題ETF，例如0052或費率更低的009816，認為長期投資仍應重視成本優勢。\n根據野村投信官網資料，00935前十大成分股為：台積電（2330）29.99%、聯發科（2454）12.44%、台達電（2308）11.79%、日月光投控（3711）5.16%、智邦（2345）3.55%、聯電（2303）3.26%、奇鋐（3017）2.33%、國巨（2327）2.17%、欣興（3017）2.33%以及致茂（2360）1.81%。\n◎《FTNN新聞網》提醒您：本資料僅供參考，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估並自負投資風險。\n更多FTNN新聞網報導\n過年前踢開高息ETF！國家隊倒貨00878、0056等4檔「提15億出場」 0050單週挨砍破萬張\n「這檔」ETF上週獲外資9.4萬張進貨！再買8.4萬張00919 與0050同連3買\n8兆資金瘋ETF！金蛇年10大吸金王揭曉 0052、0050、00904規模翻倍\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "蘋果公司 (AAPL-US) 近期在確保尖端半導體方面陷入苦戰，全球最大的代工企業台積電 (TSM-US)(2330-TW) 的產能不足，正在成為 iPhone 增產的瓶頸。而蘋果也失去做為第一大客戶的特殊優勢。\n此前超過 15 年，蘋果一直是台積電「優先客戶」，享有最先進製程的首發權與議價優勢。然而，隨著人工智慧基礎設施需求的爆炸式增長，這場權力結構正發生根本性轉變。在 2025 年，輝達 (NVDA-US) 已經超越蘋果，正式成為台積電營收貢獻度最高的客戶。\n輝達崛起與產能爭奪戰 數據顯示，輝達 2026 財年的增長率高達 62%，相較之下，蘋果的產品營收增長僅為 3.6%。台積電 2025 年的營收成長幾乎完全由高效能運算 (HPC) 驅動，市場預計， 2026 年輝達將占台積電營收份額的 20%，領先蘋果的 16%。\n\n這場權力轉移不僅體現在營收數字上，更是一場物理上的「矽晶圓爭奪戰」。一顆輝達 Blackwell 或 Rubin GPU 的晶粒面積超過 800 平方公釐，而蘋果 A20 晶片僅約 100 至 120 平方公釐。這意味著，每生產一顆輝達 GPU，就會消耗相當於 6 到 8 顆 iPhone 晶片的物理空間。\n\n據報導，截至 2026 年 1 月，台積電的 2 奈米產能已達到每月 50,000 片以上晶圓。台積電計畫在 2026 年年底前，將 2 奈米的月產能進一步提升至 120,000 至 140,000 片。儘管產能持續增加，但 2 奈米的所有產能目前已處於全數售罄的狀態，客戶甚至需要支付比 3 奈米高出 50% 的溢價 (每片晶圓約 3 萬美元) 來爭奪產量。\n當台積電產能滿載時，這便成了一場零和競爭，而願意支付高額溢價的 AI 客戶顯然更具優勢。\n議價優勢喪失與前所未有的漲價壓力 媒體報導，台積電執行長魏哲家於 2025 年 8 月親自造訪蘋果加州總部，傳達了一個關鍵訊號：蘋果將面臨「多年來最大幅度的漲價」，且不再享有保證產能的特權。\n過去蘋果憑藉龐大且穩定的訂單，能換取最優惠的製造條件，但如今台積電的產能分配更像是一場拍賣會，由利潤更高、成長更快的 AI 客戶取勝。\n台積電 2025 年第四季毛利率高達 62.3%，已接近軟體公司的水準，反映出其在供不應求環境下的強大議價力。\n蘋果的戰略調整 面對產能受限與成本攀升，蘋果採取了 15 年來首次的重大策略轉向。蘋果已宣布與英特爾 (INTC-US) 達成代工合作，預計在 2027 年將入門級 M 系列晶片 (如 MacBook Air 所用) 轉往 Intel 18A 製程生產，以規避單一供應鏈風險並緩解對台積電的依賴。\n同時，雙方的競爭火線已延伸至「先進封裝」領域。隨著蘋果 M5、M6 系列晶片導入 Chiplet 模組化設計並尋求 CoWoS 封裝架構，蘋果將與輝達在台積電 AP6 與 AP7 等 3D 先進封裝產線上「正面對撞」。業界普遍認為，未來幾年半導體產業的核心戰略將進入「封裝為王」的時代。\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "商傳媒 ｜記者陳宜靖／綜合外電報導\n全球晶圓代工龍頭台積電宣布調整日本布局策略，原定於熊本第二工廠量產6奈米製程，如今轉向更先進的3奈米技術，為日本半導體自主化與產業升級投下震撼彈。隨著人工智慧（AI）與資料中心需求飆升，日本在高階晶片供應鏈中的角色正面臨關鍵轉折。\n根據規劃，台積電位於熊本縣菊陽町的第二工廠，原本鎖定2027年啟動6奈米量產，主攻電動車與高效能運算晶片。然而近期公司高層向日本政府說明，將評估導入3奈米製程，顯示策略方向已從成熟製程升級至尖端技術。半導體線寬愈小，電晶體密度愈高，運算效能與能效比同步提升。3奈米目前廣泛應用於高階智慧型手機與伺服器晶片，是AI算力競賽的核心節點。\n\n日本過去在半導體材料與設備領域具全球領導地位，但在先進製程量產上逐漸落後。目前日本企業多集中於40奈米以上製程，若能在本土建立3奈米產線，將補強高階晶片缺口，有助於提升整體產業競爭力與經濟安全。尤其在地緣政治風險升高的背景下，分散生產基地成為各國共同課題。\n\n日本政府已規劃提供最高1.2兆日圓補貼支持台積電設廠。製程升級意味設備與研發成本增加，資金需求勢必擴大。市場觀察，政府在強化供應鏈韌性與財政負擔之間需取得平衡。支持者認為，投資尖端製程可帶動周邊材料、設備與人才培育，創造長期經濟效益；審慎者則指出，高階晶片市場競爭激烈，需求波動風險不容忽視。\nAI浪潮為此次轉向提供重要動能。資料中心對高效能晶片需求激增，3奈米製程成為全球科技企業布局焦點。台積電過去僅在台灣量產最先進技術，如2奈米已於台灣率先啟動試產。若日本成功導入3奈米，象徵技術外溢與國際合作進入新階段，也顯示企業在全球多點布局的策略深化。\n另一方面，日本本土晶片計畫亦同步推進。由政府力挺的Rapidus預計於2027年在北海道千歲市量產2奈米製程，目標打造國產尖端晶片品牌。市場期待台積電與Rapidus形成互補格局，一方面由國際龍頭提供成熟量產經驗，另一方面培養本土自主技術，形成雙軌並進的產業生態。\n產業鏈效應亦備受關注。日本在光阻材料、矽晶圓與半導體設備等領域具深厚實力，若先進製程落地，將強化本土供應鏈整合。熊本大學等學術機構正加速培育半導體專業人才，地方政府亦投入資源建構技術聚落。分析指出，人才與技術累積需時間發酵，短期內仍仰賴跨國合作與經驗移轉。\n綜合觀察，台積電熊本廠升級3奈米不僅是單一企業決策，更牽動日本半導體戰略轉型。從AI算力競逐、供應鏈重組到經濟安全布局，皆顯示全球半導體版圖正重新洗牌。未來能否在成本、技術與市場需求間取得最佳平衡，將決定日本在新一輪晶片競賽中的定位。\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的;

AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "Got some idle money you're ready to put to work for a while? Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nQualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\n\nPayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\n\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\n\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\n\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\n\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\n\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee the 3 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) has been one of the hottest stocks in the market, but a 14% pullback from highs hit in early February could be a buying opportunity. And despite its recent highs, the stock is still not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and just over 7.5 times fiscal 2027 estimates.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe company is a leading producer of NAND storage devices, or flash memory. It is one of the few pure-play ways to invest in this segment of the tech market after the company was spun off from Western Digital about a year ago. NAND has been a very cyclical market over the years, but the space looks like it is at the beginning of what appears to be a long-lasting supercycle.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that the NAND market was in complete disarray. After seeing huge demand for electronics stemming from the pandemic, memory makers overbuilt production, causing a huge oversupply in the market that led prices to crash. Things became so bad that NAND gross margins turned negative.\n\nThis disarray led many memory makers to hugely cut NAND production and redirect their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory). At the same time, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized form of DRAM, began to take off because of its importance in helping optimize the performance of graphics processing units when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. HBM comes with strong unit economics, but it needs huge wafer capacity, so it began eating up memory maker resources.\n\nSoon after, AI data centers also started to need huge, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use NAND to help store training data. With production slashed and demand now suddenly surging, flash memory prices have been skyrocketing because there is now a huge NAND shortage. Given the economics and demand for HBM, along with growing demand for NAND, these market dynamics are unlikely to shift anytime in the near future.\n\nWith flash memory in short supply, Sandisk continues to benefit from increased prices, which are also dramatically lifting its gross margins and profits. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 61%, while its gross margins expanded from 32.3% a year ago to 50.9%, leading its adjusted earnings per share to surge fivefold.\n\nWith the NAND market going from a cyclical business to a structural growth story on the back of AI data centers, Sandisk finds itself in an enviable position. And with the boom in AI infrastructure spending, the company is set to see huge growth ahead. This makes the recent dip a buying opportunity.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd sold its entire position in CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) during the fourth quarter, according to a February 11 SEC filing, with an estimated transaction value of $9.75 million.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated February 11, Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd reported selling all 479,000 shares of CoreCivic in the fourth quarter. The estimated transaction value was $9.75 million.\n\nTop holdings after the filing:\n\nNASDAQ:GOOGL: $225.77 million (34.6% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ:TSEM: $172.85 million (26.5% of AUM)\n\nNYSE:CLF: $96.28 million (14.7% of AUM)\n\nNYSE:GEO: $91.00 million (13.9% of AUM)\n\nNYSE:PSTG: $67.01 million (10.3% of AUM)\n\nAs of February 11, shares of CoreCivic were priced at $18.50, up 2.5% over the past year and underperforming the S&P 500 by 11.8 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nPrice (as of market close February 11, 2026)\n\n$18.50\n\nMarket capitalization\n\n$1.98 billion\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$2.09 billion\n\nNet income (TTM)\n\n$109.24 million\n\nCoreCivic, Inc. operates correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, and provides government real estate solutions across the United States.\n\nThe company generates revenue primarily through long-term contracts with government agencies for facility management, rehabilitation programs, and property leasing.\n\nIts main customers are federal, state, and local government entities seeking corrections, detention, and reentry services.\n\nCoreCivic, Inc. is a leading U.S. provider of partnership correctional and detention management services, with a diversified portfolio spanning safety, community reentry, and real estate segments. The company leverages its scale and experience to deliver secure facility operations and rehabilitation programs for government partners. Its integrated service offerings and long-term contracts support stable cash flows and position CoreCivic as a key player in the specialty REIT sector.\n\nWhen a concentrated portfolio reallocates capital away from a government services operator that just posted $604.0 million in quarterly revenue and $26.5 million in fourth quarter net income, it likely signals positioning, not necessarily pessimism.\n\nCoreCivic grew full-year 2025 revenue to $2.2 billion and net income to $116.5 million, with normalized funds from operations per diluted share of $2.05. Management expects 2026 net income between $147.5 million and $157.5 million and EBITDA as high as $445.0 million. That is not a business in retreat.\n\nFor a portfolio already heavily weighted toward cyclical and policy-sensitive names like Cleveland-Cliffs and GEO Group, trimming or exiting another corrections exposure may simply reduce thematic overlap or open up opportunities for targeted bets in other names. CoreCivic’s leverage of 2.8 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and expanding credit facility provide flexibility, but the stock still carries headline and regulatory risk.\n\nBefore you buy stock in CoreCivic, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CoreCivic wasn’t one of them.

The estimated transaction value was $38.60 million based on the average closing price during the fourth quarter of 2025.

Moreover, shares within a whisper of their 52-week low of $42.45.\n\nThe stock has come under pressure as the commercial insurance market has entered a slump. Consequently, the stock has lost steam. In addition, some company insiders have engaged in stock sales — which can poison market sentiment and serve as a warning to retail investors.\n\nOn the other hand, some institutional investors (like Reinhart Partners) remain bullish on the stock.

      "Content": "Find your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nIf you are wondering whether Sandisk’s current share price lines up with its underlying worth, this article walks through what the numbers say about value.\n\nThe stock last closed at US$630.29, with returns of 9.4% over 7 days, 61.7% over 30 days and 129.0% year to date, while the 1-year return is very large.\n\nRecent headlines around Sandisk have focused on its role in storage technology and broader interest in tech names, giving extra attention to a stock that has already moved sharply. This context matters for anyone trying to understand whether the current price reflects fundamentals or more sentiment-driven trading.\n\nRight now, Sandisk scores 2 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by its valuation score . We will look at what different valuation approaches suggest and then finish with a simple way to bring this into one clearer view of value.\n\nSandisk scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model looks at the cash Sandisk is expected to generate in the future and then discounts those projected cash flows back to today to estimate what the business might be worth right now.\n\nFor Sandisk, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $1.41b. Analysts and Simply Wall St then project cash flows out over the next decade using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with analyst estimates feeding into the earlier years and extrapolated figures used for the later period. For example, projected Free Cash Flow for 2028 is $11.98b, and the discounted values for the 2026 to 2035 stream of cash flows range from roughly $4.71b to $10.39b per year in present value terms.\n\nPulling those together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2,008.01 per share. Against the recent share price of US$630.29, this implies Sandisk trades at about a 68.6% discount. On these assumptions, the DCF view indicates that the stock is materially undervalued.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Sandisk is undervalued by 68.6%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 52 more high quality undervalued stocks .\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Sandisk.\n\nFor a business like Sandisk, where investors often focus on revenue potential, the P/S ratio is a useful way to compare what the market is paying for each dollar of sales. It sidesteps short term earnings swings and puts the spotlight on the top line.\n\nIn general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/S multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more conservative range. So the key question is not just whether a multiple is high or low, but whether it fits the company’s profile.\n\nSandisk currently trades on a P/S ratio of 10.42x, which is well above the Tech industry average of 2.00x and above the peer group average of 4.98x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Sandisk is 8.80x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/S might be, given factors like Sandisk’s earnings, profit margins, risk profile, industry and market cap. Because it blends these company specific drivers, it can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry.\n\nComparing the current 10.42x P/S to the 8.80x Fair Ratio suggests Sandisk is trading above this fair value range.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nP/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 23 top founder-led companies .\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, and on Simply Wall St that means building a Narrative, which is simply your story about Sandisk, linked to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins that roll up into a Fair Value you can compare to the current price on the Community page used by millions of investors.\n\nInstead of only relying on ratios or a single DCF output, a Narrative lets you say, for example, “I think Sandisk looks closer to the bearish case with revenue growing around 16.3% a year, margins at about 13.8% and earnings of roughly $1.7b by 2029, which implies a Fair Value near $157.81.” Or: “I am closer to the bullish view that lines up with earnings of about $5.7b by 2028 and a Fair Value of around $322.00.” You can then see in real time how new news or earnings updates shift those numbers and whether your Fair Value is above or below today’s share price.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for Sandisk?

      "Content": "Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd initiated a new position in Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) during the fourth quarter, acquiring 7,250,000 shares in a trade estimated at $96.28 million, according to a February 11 SEC filing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated February 11, Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd established a new position in Cleveland-Cliffs by purchasing 7,250,000 shares. The fund’s quarter-end stake was valued at $96.28 million.\n\nThis was a new position, now comprising 14.75% of Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd’s 13F reportable assets under management as of December 31.\n\nTop holdings after the filing:\n\nNASDAQ: GOOGL: $225.77 million (34.6% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: TSEM: $172.85 million (26.5% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: CLF: $96.28 million (14.8% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: GEO: $91.00 million (13.9% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: PSTG: $67.01 million (10.3% of AUM)\n\nAs of February 11, shares of Cleveland-Cliffs were priced at $12.48, up 10.4% over the prior year.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nPrice (as of market close 2/11/26)\n\n$12.48\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\n$7.12 billion\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$18.61 billion\n\nNet Income (TTM)\n\n($1.48 billion)\n\nCleveland-Cliffs produces flat-rolled steel, stainless steel, electrical steel, tinplate, tubular components, and hot-briquetted iron.\n\nThe company generates revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of steel products and value-added steel solutions for various industrial applications.\n\nIts main customers include automotive manufacturers, infrastructure and manufacturing firms, distributors, converters, and other steel producers across North America.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc. is a leading North American steel producer with a vertically integrated business model, leveraging both steelmaking and iron ore mining assets. The company serves a diversified customer base, with significant exposure to the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Its scale, product breadth, and control over raw materials position it as a key supplier in the regional steel industry.\n\nThis move creates a $96.28 million position that now accounts for 14.75% of reported assets, instantly making steel a core driver of portfolio performance in a heavily concentrated portfolio.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs just reported fourth-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, flat year over year, alongside a $235 million net loss and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $21 million. For the full year, revenue slipped to $18.6 billion from $19.2 billion, and net loss widened to $1.4 billion. Liquidity stood at $3.3 billion, and management is guiding for 2026 steel shipments of roughly 16.5 to 17.0 million net tons, with targeted unit cost reductions of about $10 per net ton.\n\nThat backdrop makes the allocation notable. This is a portfolio already concentrated in large technology names and cyclical plays, with over $225 million in Alphabet and nearly $173 million in Tower Semiconductor. Adding a nearly $100 million steel position alongside a $91 million stake in GEO tilts exposure toward economically sensitive assets.\n\nLong-term investors should focus less on quarterly losses and more on balance sheet flexibility, cost discipline, and whether improved trade dynamics and automotive demand can translate into sustained margin recovery. A position this large suggests the buyer believes the cycle is closer to a trough than a peak.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cleveland-Cliffs, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cleveland-Cliffs wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The global semiconductor industry appears to be going through structural tailwinds. Fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, global semiconductor industry annual sales are projected to touch $975 billion in 2026, a historic peak. Furthermore, with sustained growth, annual sales may touch $2 trillion by 2036.\n\nWith that in mind, it's unsurprising that semiconductor stocks have surged higher. While some investors might have missed out on the big rally, there also still seem to be pockets of opportunity left. Amid volatility, shares of STMicroelectronics (STM) have trended 43% higher in the last 52 weeks. This lesser-known chip stock seems to hold significant potential.\n\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSTMicroelectronics recently announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), and this multi-billion-dollar collaboration underscores the point of scope for value creation. As part of the deal, STM will be a supplier of advanced semiconductor technologies and products to AWS. Further, STM will issue warrants to AWS for up to 24.8 million shares. Besides establishing credibility, this deal is likely to be a top-line growth driver for STMicroelectronics and STM stock.\n\nBased in the Netherlands and headquartered in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of semiconductor products globally. The company’s key business segments include RF & Optical Communications, Analog Products, MEMS & Sensors, Embedded Processing, and Power & Discrete Products. In terms of end users, the automotive, industrial and personal electronics segments are business growth drivers for the company.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, STMicroelectronics reported revenue of $11.8 billion with a gross margin of 33.9%. For the same period, the firm reported free cash flow of $265 million.\n\nWhile STMicroelectronics reported revenue degrowth in fiscal 2025, SMT stock has trended higher by 28% in the last six months, in part due to a positive long-term outlook backed by key strategic partnerships.\n\nWhile revenue degrowth is a concern, STM stock has been in an uptrend. After all, the company has multiple growth catalysts in the next few years. The partnership with AWS is one growth trigger. Similarly, the company’s chip supply to SpaceX for Starlink is expected to double in the next two years.\n\nSTM has also indicated that revenue from silicon carbide power devices is expected to return to 2024 levels by next year. This is after a contraction in revenue in 2025. Further, the firm is targeting data center revenue of $1 billion before the end of the decade.\n\nIn another important development in December 2025, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a €500 million financing agreement with the company. This is the initial tranche for a €1 billion credit line that’s intended to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. According to the agreement, 60% of the funds will be utilized toward “high-volume manufacturing capabilities” within Europe while 40% will be dedicated to research & development activities. These investments are likely to translate into growth and provide STM with an innovation edge, especially with the emphasis on R&D.\n\nGiven the ratings of 17 analysts, STM stock is a consensus “Moderate Buy.” While eight analysts assign a “Strong Buy” rating to STM, another eight have a “Hold\" rating while one analyst has a bearish “Strong Sell” rating.\n\nBased on these opinions, STM stock has a mean price target of $33.25 currently, implying potential downside of 1% from current levels. However, the most bullish price target of $45 suggests that STM could rise as much as 34% from here.\n\nOne important point to note is that STM stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 times. With analysts estimating earnings growth of 100% and 68% for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively, shares will likely remain in an uptrend.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The optics industry is poised for significant growth due to the increasing demand for high-speed interconnects in data centers, as traditional copper solutions are reaching their physical and thermal limits.\n\nSeveral publicly traded optical and memory-related companies, including Lumentum, Coherent, Finisar, and SanDisk, have already shown strong momentum and could benefit from the next wave of data center expansion.\n\nThe sector presents opportunities for both primary and secondary plays, with pricing power likely for companies that can meet demand in an environment where supply constraints are becoming a critical bottleneck.\n\nRead: If you follow markets closely, Kalshi lets you profit directly from being right about what comes next.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB4w0hSpP6Y\n\nOur AI Investor Podcast hosts, Eric Bleeker and Austin Smith, have been counting down 12 trends they believe AI investors will want to keep an eye on in 2026.\n\nRecently, the two discussed the ongoing growth of the optics industry. Optical interconnects are becoming increasingly important as data centers expand because traditional copper solutions are limited by distance, data rate, and thermal constraints. This is why companies like Lumentum, Coherent, and Finisar have already seen strong gains and remain core investments in this space. Other companies, such as Sienna and Applied Optoelectronics, also contribute to the sector’s growth potential.\n\n\"When I look at an industry that could have incredible pricing power because they can't meet demand, optics exists in that space,\" says Bleeker. \"The challenge of interconnecting all these data centers is so great that previous solutions won’t be reliable at the scale needed for the future.\"\n\nBleeker suggests that investors could explore both primary and secondary plays within the industry, while cautioning that some memory stocks, like SanDisk, may carry higher long-term risk. He and Smith agree that the sector is still in the early stages of its growth cycle, making it an attractive area for investment.\n\nAustin: So our final trend optics, listeners of this pod have heard you talk about this a lot. I don't think we need to explain it anymore, but why is this trend continuing like this? This does not seem to be a spent trend as far as you're seeing it.\n\nEric Bleeker: Yeah, you know, we allude to it if someone wants to catch up on optics. The episode to listen to is March 28th of last year. The title of that episode is I've Got Right Here. These Optical Stocks Could Be Set to Ride an AI Supercycle. The main stocks we discussed on that podcast were Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) , Coherent (NASDAQ: COHR) , and Finisar. We've recommended all three and purchased them since the day of that podcast. Momentum is up 595% for Lumentum, 249% for Coherent, and 129% for Finisar. We also have stocks in the portfolio like Sienna and Applied Optoelectronics.\n\nThe big reason is the interconnect issue. The future will have millions of processors, whether GPUs or TPUs, in a data center network, and you need interconnects between chips. Historically, that's been done with copper. It's extremely cost-effective, but copper has data rate and distance limits, and we’re rapidly approaching a situation where it won’t scale.\n\nAustin: It also has thermal challenges.\n\nEric Bleeker: Yeah, it’s cost-effective, but one of the areas where optics has been historically non-cost-effective, its cost curve is coming down. Solutions for copper like Credo in the portfolio are hitting limits as you scale for next-generation data centers.\n\nThe question is: what's the next bottleneck? Momentum’s earnings call said they are already unable to meet customer demand by 30%. This is before co-pack optics takes off and before a lot of orders come in for next-generation data centers.\n\nWhen I look at an industry that could have incredible pricing power because they can't meet demand, optics exists in that space. The challenge of interconnecting all these data centers is so great that previous solutions won’t be reliable at the scale needed for the future.\n\nWe’ve recommended a lot of stocks in this sector and could add secondary plays. We’ve also talked about memory stocks, like SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) , though they might be a little too risky long-term depending on industry dynamics. Many companies supplying this industry may be fantastic investments.\n\nThat’s how we’re looking at optics right now. We brought this up alongside memory as two of our biggest trends in early 2025. Both worked out phenomenally, and I still think there’s a lot of growth here. Especially optics - it feels like it’s only in the first or second inning of its journey.\n\nMost investors are forced to guess how the market will react to news rather than trading the news itself. Kalshi flips that model by letting you trade directly on real world outcomes like interest rates, inflation prints, recessions, and the results are shocking.\n\nEach market is simple. You predict whether something will happen or not. If you are right, the contract pays out. Everyday people are printing money based on things they already know, and having a blast at the same time.

      "Content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus .\n\nRelease Date: February 12, 2026\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group ( NASDAQ:BTDR ) achieved a significant revenue increase of 226% year-over-year, reaching $225 million in Q4 2025.\n\nThe company has expanded its self-mining hash rate to over 63 exahashes per second, establishing itself as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners.\n\nBTDR is making strategic progress in AI infrastructure, with plans to retrofit a 225-megawatt facility in Norway for AI workloads, leveraging hydropower for cost efficiency.\n\nThe company is actively expanding its GPU as a service platform, with plans to add capacity in Malaysia and the United States, targeting sectors like biomedical, robotics, and gaming.\n\nBTDR's vertically integrated strategy, including proprietary chip design and a robust global power portfolio, positions it well for future growth in both Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure.\n\nDespite revenue growth, BTDR's gross profit and adjusted EBITDA declined sequentially due to lower Bitcoin prices and higher electricity costs.\n\nThe company faces litigation that could potentially delay development at its Clarington site, impacting its AI data center expansion plans.\n\nBTDR's gross margin significantly decreased to 4.7% in Q4 2025 from 24.1% in Q3 2025, driven by lower Bitcoin prices and increased depreciation expenses.\n\nOperating expenses increased to $66.3 million in Q4 2025, up from $60.5 million in Q3 2025, due to higher headcount and general corporate activities.\n\nThe company reported an adjusted net loss of $82.6 million in Q4 2025, primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, despite higher revenue.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BTDR.\n\nIs BTDR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nQ : What are the main items being discussed in your co-location negotiations? Is it down to price, duration, timing, or design? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: Discussions vary with different counterparties, covering all those aspects. These discussions are sensitive and active, and while we are confident about closing deals soon, predicting the exact timeframe is challenging.\n\nQ : Regarding financing, what should we expect in terms of debt, cost of capital, and credit enhancements? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The cost of capital will depend on the counterparties and deal terms, making it hard to predict until deals are finalized. Credit enhancements are crucial for determining development costs, and we are exploring various approaches, though nothing dramatically different from existing market practices.\n\nQ : Can you provide more details on the infrastructure piece, specifically the Tel Norway site and its customer profile? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The Tel Norway site retrofit is expected to complete by year-end, with production GPUs installed early next year. The site benefits from a low PUE of around 1.1 due to its hydropower and cold climate. Customer discussions are sensitive, but there is overlap with US customers.\n\nQ : How should we think about the growth of your Bitcoin mining business in 2026, especially with AI infrastructure deals in play? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: We are long-term believers in Bitcoin and will continue investing in mining capacity. While we haven't projected future hash rates, we remain committed to expanding our self-mining operations.\n\nQ : With lower Bitcoin prices, is there a point where you would slow mining activity due to higher costs? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: There is a price point where we might slow down, but we haven't reached it yet. Our fleet's efficiency and low energy costs allow us to continue operations even if prices drop further. Older machines might be turned off first, but we don't anticipate reaching that point soon.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Content": "Never miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\n\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\n\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\n\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\n\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\n\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\n\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nThe company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\n\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\n\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nYou will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Title": "What Makes Monolithic Power (MPWR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-monolithic-power-mpwr-strong-170004817.html",
      "Content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPWR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Monolithic Power on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I will start with a brief overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Fourth quarter total revenue reached $225,000,000, up 226% year over year and 33% sequentially. Gross profit totaled $10,600,000, adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000 for the quarter.\n\nWhile both metrics declined sequentially, the results primarily reflect a combination of lower average Bitcoin pricing, modestly higher electricity costs, substantially higher depreciation expense due to the rapid expansion of our self-mining capacity, and further investment in new talent to support our growing AI HPC initiatives. I will discuss these factors in greater detail later in the call. Let me begin with a brief review of our power and infrastructure portfolio. We continue to make meaningful progress during the quarter, advancing a global portfolio of sites that we believe are well suited to support both large-scale Bitcoin mining and next-generation AI and HPC workloads.\n\nAcross regions, our focus remains on developing power-rich, capital-efficient infrastructure that provides flexibility, speed to market, and long-term strategic optionality. From an energy infrastructure perspective, execution during the quarter remained on track. At the January, we had over 1.66 gigawatts of capacity online, and a total global power pipeline of three gigawatts. We believe this represents one of the most attractive and AI-suitable power portfolios in the industry and provides us with a vast opportunity as the demand for such capacity continues to grow. Over the past several months, have seen a significant shift in market dynamics around AI data center development.\n\nDemand for large-scale colocation capacity has increased substantially and we have responded by refining our approach to better align with this opportunity. Therefore, we are currently prioritizing colocation services provided to Norway and the United States that are suitable for large-scale AI HPC deployments. Let me walk through a few sites and where we stand with our development plans. First, Teadle, Norway, represents our most near-term colocation opportunity. This 225-megawatt facility was originally constructed to Tier III data center specifications, which puts us in a favorable position for conversion to AI workloads.\n\nWe estimate the retrofit will require much less incremental capital expenditure to add uninterruptible power supply systems, backup batteries, and generation, as well as some additional cooling capacity compared to industry benchmarks for greenfield Tier III data center development, which typically run in the $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 per megawatt range. The site benefits from hydropower with attractive economics; independent 100-megawatt transformers provide redundancy. We are currently in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expect to be in a position to announce a signed lease agreement for Teadle as soon as possible in 2026, although the exact timing is very difficult to predict.\n\nThis site should be capable of supporting initial test GPU deployment late 2026 and first production GPUs expected in early 2027. Second, our 570-megawatt site in Clarington represents one of the larger AI data center development opportunities in the United States. Have made progress on two fronts here. First, the local utility has accelerated our interconnection timeline. Second, we are currently in discussion with multiple prospective tenants. These are well recognizable companies in the space, and the discussions are progressing. While litigation has recently been filed that could potentially delay development at this location, believe that we have meritorious claims and a strong defense and will pursue an expedient solution.\n\nGiven the scale of this site, even a partial or first phase lease would represent a significant milestone for Bitdeer Technologies Group and would provide substantial contracted revenue while derisking our development capital. Third, at Rockdale, we are pursuing a strategy that allows us to maintain our current Bitcoin mining operations while developing new HPC capacity. We are evaluating the acquisition of adjacent land to our existing facility we could potentially construct a purpose-built HPC data center. This approach would minimize disruption during data center development to our 563-megawatt mining operation, which continues to generate revenue. The greenfield HPC build would be designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\n\nThe Rockdale site benefits from its location in the ERCOT market, provides operational flexibility. We are currently talking with prospective colocation tenants for this site. The dual-track approach, maintaining Bitcoin mining while developing HPC capacity, reflects our commitment to both businesses and our ability to optimize our power portfolio across use cases. While we are prioritizing colocation for our larger sites, continue to see opportunity in GPU-as-a-service for targeted markets. We are expanding our cloud platform in Malaysia by 10 to 15 megawatts, building on the success we have had in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming sectors who need fully managed orchestrated infrastructure.\n\nIn the United States, we are planning to add 10 megawatts of GPU capacity in Washington state and are evaluating a partial conversion of our Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud. I want to be clear that the scale of our long-term US GPU-as-a-service expansion is predicated on signing customer contracts. Do not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. Expect all major GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customers who are seeking meaningful capacity with comprehensive managed services. This disciplined approach ensures we are deploying capital we have revenue certainty. A key element of our strategy is how we are approaching data center development.\n\nWe have built an internal development team with experience in very large data center construction and we are augmenting that team through strategic hires, working with experienced EPC contractors and general contractors on a fee basis rather than through joint venture arrangements. This gives us greater control over timelines and specifications, and importantly, it allows us to retain more of the economic value these assets generate. As we look ahead, the growth will continue to be anchored by our three strategic pillars, between mining, ASIC development, and HPC AI. Together, these represent a vertically integrated, highly defensible platform that leverages our deep technology expertise, proprietary chip design capabilities, and extensive global power portfolio.\n\nThe supply-demand imbalance for AI compute continues to widen, and we expect this shortage to persist well into 2027. Time to power is a critical variable, and we believe Bitdeer Technologies Group is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers seeking both near-term and midterm capacity. On the Bitcoin mining side, the rapid expansion of our self-mining platform continues. We exited the year with more than 55 exahash per second of self-mining hash rate, and in the month of January alone, we brought another eight exahash per second online, exiting the month of January at over 63 exahash per second. This firmly establishes Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners by total hash rate under management.\n\nSupported by the disciplined rollout of our SealMiner fleet, accelerated deployment of SealMiner rigs has driven material improvements in fleet-wide efficiency. The SealMiner A2 and A3 being actively deployed in our self-mining business operate at approximately 15 to 16.5 joules per terahash and 12.5 to 14 joules per terahash respectively, and represent industry-leading power efficiency. As these next-generation rigs replace legacy third-party equipment, our blended fleet efficiency continues to improve, with our overall fleet-wide efficiency currently standing at 17.5 joules per terahash as of 01/31/2026. As SealMiner penetration increases throughout 2026, we expect our overall fleet-wide efficiency to continue to improve, enhancing our mining margins. Looking ahead, our self-mining operations are not plateauing.\n\nOur investments in chip design are delivering tangible results. During the quarter, we commenced mass production of the SealMiner A3 series. Initial shipments began in November, and we have deployed a total of 8.7 exahash of our SealMiner A3 to date. As we continue to retire older-generation third-party rigs, we expect the A3 series to continue to meaningfully contribute to our fleet efficiency improvements and growth throughout 2026. On the R&D front, our CLO4-1 chip was completed back in September. The CLO4-1 represents a meaningful step forward in efficiency and positions Bitdeer Technologies Group to maintain technological leadership as the industry continues its relentless drive towards lower power consumption per unit of hash rate.\n\nMass production of mining rigs based on the CLO4-1 chip will begin in Q1 2026. CLO4-2 chip design remains under development at our US-based design center. Additionally, we have successfully taped out a new Litecoin chip, SEAL-DL1, designed for Doge and Litecoin mining. The initial test results of SEAL-DL1 have exceeded comparable rigs in both energy efficiency and hash rate. On the recent market conditions, the CLDL1 generates higher fiat-based returns per megawatt than our SealMiner A2. Preparation for USA SealMiner manufacturing remains in progress. This initiative is a core component of our vertically integrated strategy and aligns with both operational resilience objectives and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.\n\nNow let me walk through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all figures I refer to today are in US dollars. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $224,800,000, up 225.8% year over year and up 32.5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth and sequential growth in revenue was primarily driven by significantly higher self-mining hash rate as a result of continued CLMiner deployment, as well as contributions from SealMiner sales, offset in part by slightly lower Bitcoin prices for the quarter. Self-mining revenue was $168,600,000, compared to $41,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $130,900,000 in Q3 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 306% and a sequential growth of 28.7%.\n\nContinued growth from Q3 2025 levels reflects a significant increase in average operating hash rate and associated Bitcoin production during the quarter, offset in part by 13% lower average Bitcoin prices quarter on quarter. SealMiner sales revenue was $23,400,000, up 105.4% over the $11,400,000 reported in Q3 2025. Total gross profit for the quarter was $10,600,000, reflecting a gross margin of 4.7%, versus 7.4% in Q4 2024 and $40,800,000 or 24.1% in Q3 2025. Significant decline in gross margin reflects the combined impact of several drivers during the quarter. First, obviously, we experienced 13% lower Bitcoin prices during the quarter along with the gradual increase of the global hash rate.\n\nSecond, on the cost side, experienced an approximately 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit during the quarter when compared to Q3 2025, mainly due to the seasonal winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites. Third, the growth in our self-mining hash rate comes with a concurrent noncash depreciation expense associated with this fleet of new miners. Additionally, during the quarter, we changed our methodology for calculating depreciation expense to reflect a more conservative approach. Now depreciate rigs using a three-year straight-line method versus our prior assumption of a five-year depreciable life for hardware. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $66,300,000 compared to $42,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $60,500,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following factors compared to Q3. We added more headcount to support both mining site operations and our AI infrastructure expansion, incurred additional holiday season compensation, along with an increase in year-end general corporate activities. These expenditures reflect the operational requirements of our growing infrastructure footprint and the resources necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives. Other operating expenses for the quarter was $43,800,000 compared to $3,700,000 in Q4 2024 and other operating income of $26,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to the fair value change of Bitcoins pledged for the Bitcoin-collateralized loan since Q3 2025.\n\nOther net gain for the quarter was $208,900,000 compared to other net loss of $4 and $79,800,000 in Q4 2024 and $238,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to noncash fair value change of derivative liabilities related to the convertible senior notes issued in November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025. Adjusted net loss was $82,600,000 versus $37,400,000 in Q4 2024 and $36,300,000 in Q3 2025. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, higher operating and interest expense, partially offset by the year-over-year higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000, versus negative $4,300,000 in Q4 2024 and positive $39,600,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher operating expenses attributed to salaries and wages for recent additions to our headcount, as well as a number of elevated costs associated with year-end holiday allowance and year-end general corporate activities. To provide a better sense of our G&A expense on a run-rate basis, our Q4 2025 results reflect approximately $3,000,000 of salary, wage, and benefits expense which will largely be recurring, as well as another $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 in consulting, legal, and travel expenses which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $599,500,000, primarily driven by SealMiner supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs from the mining business, general corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97,900,000, which includes $50,700,000 of capital expenditures relating to data center infrastructure construction, GPU equipment procurement, and tariffs and freight for mining rigs delivered to the data centers, and $150,600,000 of proceeds from the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the quarter $454,500,000, which resulted primarily from $388,500,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $168,000,000 in borrowings from a related party, and $141,500,000 of proceeds from shares sold under our ATM and ELOC program, free offset by $171,100,000 of repayments of borrowings. For the full calendar year 2025, capital expenditures for the continued build out of our global power and data center infrastructure totaled $176,000,000. Looking to full year 2026, we anticipate total infrastructure spend in the range of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 for crypto mining data center construction.\n\nPlease note that this guidance covers power and crypto mining data center infrastructure only and does not include CapEx for SealMiners and GPU. AI cloud and colocation capital expenditures are also not included. Turning to our balance sheet and financial position. We exited the year with $149,400,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $83,100,000 in cryptocurrencies, held at cost less impairment, $135,600,000 in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1,000,000,000 in borrowings excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities were $501,100,000, relate to the November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025 convertible senior notes.\n\nThis represents $171,400,000 reduction compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a noncash fair value adjustment driven by the change in our stock price and settlement for partial principal of November 2024 convertible senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, this does not impact our liquidity or operations. Regarding our outstanding ATM and ELOC facility, we received approximately $143,600,000 in gross proceeds during the quarter. Approximately 6,700,000 additional shares issued. We have exercised disciplined capital allocation throughout the year using the ATM and ELOC opportunistically to support our growth initiative while minimizing dilution.\n\nAs a final note to our financial update, we wish to note that starting in Q1 2026, we will begin to use GAAP instead of IFRS as our accounting standard. In summary, we are proud of our team's execution this quarter and throughout 2025. I want to express my deep pride what our team has accomplished this year. Established Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the world's largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining operators by total hash rate under management. Our leadership position in self-mining and our proprietary SealMiner technology provide multiple paths to value creation that few, if any, competitors can match.\n\nOur pipeline of developed and contracted power capacity gives us a meaningful competitive edge in serving a variety of customers. The colocation opportunity ahead of us is immense, we are pursuing it proactively. We enter 2026 with strong operational momentum, a differentiated asset base, and a team that has proven its ability to execute at scale. Excited about what lies ahead and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, Operator. Please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open for questions. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *11 and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Giles of B. Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nNick Giles: Yes. Thank you so much, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Haris, really appreciate the comprehensive update, especially on the colocation side. And my first question was just, and I am sure you are speaking to a range of customers, and you know, at this point of negotiations or discussions, what is really the main items that are being discussed? Is it down to price, duration, timing? There is still a lot of work ongoing around design. Just any additional color on where you stand in the process.\n\nHaris Basit: It is different with different potential counterparties, and we are all of those things that you mentioned are being discussed, maybe not with the same counterparty, but you know, I hesitate to say too much about these discussions. They are sensitive, and you know, very active at this time. So you know, we feel pretty confident that we are going to get colocation deals done in the near future. Predicting that time frame is going to be hard. And, you know, the discussions are pretty intense with several counterparties.\n\nNick Giles: No. Understood. That is helpful, and just my second question was, we think about financing, you made some important comments there on having a larger share of the economics. But should we be expecting in terms of debt cost of capital and what kind of credit enhancements are you looking at, if any?\n\nHaris Basit: Cost of capital for these projects, for the colocation projects, will be very much determined by the counterparties and exact terms of the deal. So I think that is hard to predict right now until we, you know, announce which of these deals are done with which counterparties. Was that responsive to your question? I am not sure if that is what you were.\n\nNick Giles: Asking.\n\nHaris Basit: I mean, that is an important part of any deal. And, you know, it is because it does determine the cost of development to a large extent. And so we are, you know, we are looking at many different approaches here. It is a very important part of getting the deal done right. So it is something that we are focusing on as well. I cannot really say which ones are better or worse. It depends a lot on the counterparty, and it depends on, you know, there is a number of ways to do this. Most of them have been already done in the Marketplace.\n\nAnd know, I do not think you will see anything too dramatically different from those when we announce.\n\nNick Giles: Got it. Understood. Well, again, I appreciate the update, and continue. Best of luck.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Colonnese of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Colonnese: Today. First one for me on the infrastructure piece. It sounds like you are pretty far along in negotiations for a potential colo deal at the Teadle site. Curious what type of customers you are in discussions with specifically at that campus. And, Haris, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the full retrofit for the 225 megs could be completed by the end of this year. There a PUE you guys are assuming that number? I know it is built with Tier III standards in mind, but any additional color would be helpful there.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is correct. We do expect completion of that Teadle Norway site in at the end of this year and then installation of production GPUs at the beginning of next year. And the PUE at that site is actually very low, which is one of the biggest advantages of that site. It is, you know, it is 100% hydropower. It is a nice cold climate. And there is chilled water available from a nearby lake. So the PUE there, for estimation purposes, is around 1.1. It is dramatically better than most locations.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. And then, the typical customer profile for that site specific, I know you are in discussions with the range of customers across the portfolio. I would be just curious with that international facility, the type of customers you are looking at.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, there is some difference, but, you know, there is still a lot of overlap with the customers there versus customers in the United States. So but, you know, I really do not want to say too much about who we are talking to and the exact nature of those deals. They are fairly sensitive negotiations at this point. Understood. Understood. And then as it relates to the Bitcoin mining business, you guys are one of the few public miners that continue to rapidly expand your self-mining capacity. How should we think about growth in this business in 2026? Particularly as you look to pursue these AI infrastructure deals across parts of the portfolio?\n\nHaris Basit: So one thing to say is that we are long-term believers in Bitcoin. And, of course, Bitcoin is in a little bit of a down cycle right now. But long term, we believe in Bitcoin. And we will continue to invest in our Bitcoin mining capacity. We have not given any projections for what the total hash rate for our company might be by the end of this year or in any future quarter yet. We are still evaluating that and we may project that at a later time. But at this time, we do not have any projections to share publicly for future growth of our hash rate.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. Thanks for the color, Haris, and best of luck with these opportunities.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all this capacity you have activated. But maybe along those lines that was asked before, with the lower Bitcoin prices, is there a price where you slow your mining activity because costs are higher versus what the hash price would be?\n\nHaris Basit: I am sure there is such a price, so we just have not reached it yet. So you know, our efficiency of our fleet keeps improving. And, so it also, you know, as price goes down, it be the entire fleet. Some parts of the fleet, you know, because of the efficiency and because of the energy price at that location, can continue to operate for quite some, you know, in quite some even further decrease beyond here. And then you will, some of the older machines that have been around for several years, those could be turned off first. Right? In fact, just in our normal upgrade cycle, we will be replacing those.\n\nSo there is, you know, we have not reached that point now, and I do not anticipate that we will. But, you know, of course, there is such a price. It is just much lower than what we are at now.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. That is good information. I guess as you keep lowering your costs, then you can handle lower Bitcoin prices. But just as another topic, is the GPU-as-a-service, is there a good market for the, say, N minus one GPU clusters rather than spending money on the very leading edge of GPUs? Is there still a need for GPU-as-a-service for the older GPUs?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. There is. We are, though, however, typically pursuing the latest and greatest GPUs. But I mean, we still get demand for, you know, even our oldest H100s that we have in Singapore.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi of ROTH. Your line is now open.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Yes, good morning. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Haris, could you dive a little bit more into sort of the scale and scope of the hires you have made for digital infrastructure towards the end of the year that you spoke to, and then kind of the cadence of continued investment in maybe Q1 and into 2026? I guess, at what point do you feel like you have an adequate team to kind of attack this opportunity?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, we are very pleased with some of our recent hires. We have hired people with direct expertise in AI, in cloud services. And a lot of those folks have been in the United States, but also in Asia. The team is, you know, the number of people dedicated to this has grown dramatically. I do not think I have an exact number. But we continue to hire. I do not think we have reached, you know, a place where we think we have enough folks yet. But we are still looking for people, especially on the side of the engineering part of building data centers with still open racks there. So no.\n\nI expect that we will continue to hire throughout the year. And a lot of those folks will be in the United States. But, you know, we have also done significant AI hiring in Asia.\n\nDarren Aftahi: Got it. And then same question on the Rockdale site is sort of twofold. In terms of land acquisition for that, kind of where are you, and what is the timeline on process? And then I know Oncor is supposed to put another substation in, and I think you guys have spoken to additional capacity there. I think it is in the 100-some plus megawatts. But in light of kind of the seesaw that is going on with ERCOT and decision on batching, just kind of curious about your thoughts about prospects of Rockdale actually growing as a site. Thanks.\n\nHaris Basit: The recent, you know, information around ERCOT and power allocation in that region, we do not believe that applies to the growth at Rockdale. So the 179, up to 179 megawatts that we anticipate we could add there, should not be affected by that. And I say it that way because, of course, we do not know what the exact regulations will be. They are just still under discussion. So we do expect that we will get most of that, if not all of that additional capacity. The land acquisition there is moving forward. You know, it is not done until it is done, but we are, we are, yeah.\n\nI am not sure how to characterize where we are in that process, but, you know, we are actively pursuing it. And we expect that we will finish it. But until we do, it is hard to say exactly when that is going to happen. Great. Appreciate the insights. Thanks.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis of BTIG. Your line is now open.\n\nGreg Lewis: Hey. Thank you, and good morning. Good open. Hey, I guess first, I mean, on published numbers, I guess you guys are the bitcoin miner of the listed companies by XFASH. So congrats on that. I did want to talk a little bit about the GPU business. You noted about potential expanse. You should a mouthful. The potential expansion in Malaysia. Know, just kind of curious, is that infrastructure that we are building, are we leasing? And then just kind of how should we think about, you know, the rollout of that, I guess, I think you mentioned 15 megawatts in Malaysia for the GPUs.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is infrastructure that we are leasing. I welcome Matt or Jihan to add to that. They want. But what was the second part of your question? How should we think about the rollout of bringing those 15 megawatts online and generating revenue from that? I mean, we have proactively purchased some, I think, the GB200 NVL72 and installed it just recently there. So that is in place right now. In terms of additional machines there, do not think we have made any announcements at present. So that is actually.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. But it is, but it sounds like it sounds like we could start seeing revenue maybe in the second quarter, and then maybe that scales up sequentially for a couple of quarters?\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I think, John and Matt are closer to that than I am. So I do not know if, is that a, is that a correct statement that you have?\n\nJihan Wu: I think we will be able to deploy GPUs into those infrastructures at the fourth quarter or third quarter of this year. It depends on when that infrastructure will be ready. We will no tests. It will be ready around June. But, and maybe there will be one or two month delays. So I sent 2024 can be more conservative estimation.\n\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Alright. Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time, and have a great day.\n\nJihan Wu: Thank you, Greg.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question and the all the extra hash, bro. I guess, can we just get a bit more color on Clarrington? Like, do you need litigation results before signing an HPC customer there? You view that differently. Maybe any guardrails on timeline there? And then I have a follow-up on the mining piece.\n\nHaris Basit: So because it is litigation, we have to be sort of, you know, more careful in what we say here. You know, our attorneys feel very strongly that we have a very good case here, and the litigation has little merit, and we will, you know, prevail here. And on the business side, we are, you know, exploring alternative that can mitigate the impact of the litigation. I do not really want to say a lot more than that. You know, as we said in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate that there will be, you know, some potential delay. But, you know, we are still confident in the site overall.\n\nBut it is early days, and we, you know, we are looking at some significant alternatives.\n\nJihan Wu: Yeah. I think the alternative, alternative here, we have multiple alternative options. Creating alternative options is to solve those problems. I believe it is very critical solving those problems. And at a company level, Clarrington, Rockdale, and our lower chin size, we would be able to have lots of alternatives. Other than Carrington. This is the company level. And under the Clariton level, we believe we have several solutions. So I do not think that we are really caught at this kind of litigation.\n\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on the that latest tape out for the Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, do you anticipate mining some of these other assets? Alongside Bitcoin? And maybe I was looking at some of the margin profile. It looks like there is still some margin there. But maybe the opportunity in those as well.\n\nJihan Wu: Well, I think 99% or 98% will still be Bitcoin mining. This autochrome mining operations cannot really be scalable very much due to the market cap. So we count into a very small size operations. But on those, on those capacity, we deploy those manual rates yield out of from those capacity will be significantly improved. So I think it is worth the effort to add some, add some. And then, by the way, this is our first b commanding chip and the manual machines that are designed and manufactured totally depends on our Singapore and the Malaysia office. And the Malaysia operation as well. Malaysia operation, we started to build since last year or earlier.\n\nI think that this product, it also means that our supply chain center in Malaysia has been quite mature. So Malaysia and Vietnam, we will have two supply chain center. For companies. Think it is very strategic and important for the resilience of our business in the future.\n\nHaris Basit: Understood. That is helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\n\nBrett Knoblauch: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe now that we are several weeks into the year, I am curious if you have any insights into what wafer allocation is going to look like this year compared to last year? And on the back of that, with Bitcoin price coming down, network cash staying resilient, hash price going to kind of near all-time lows, does that, you know, more incentivize you guys to use manufacturing capacity for, call it, internal use rather than sell external? Or how should we kind of look at the split between what you guys manufacture for yourselves Versus sell this year? Thank you.\n\nJihan Wu: We cannot tell the exact number or situation with the different allocation, but we have a really good relationships. And even though the we all know that the demand for AI business is huge, several times. Then take them to rehab, but we will get some co coda from additional capacity. And the hash price drops to historically due now recently. And it became very difficult for sending the money works with profit. But we have our own capacities or electricity cost is one of the lowest on the market. And our CapEx, so perhaps combined together, we are the lowest on the market.\n\nSo our self money definitely became kind of very defensive, very safe strategy for our companies to make sure that even though in this kind of environment, our Bitcoin mining operations will be profitable. So self deployment will be a very important strategy in 2006, especially in the kind of a very bearish marketplace. I think our market share for the Bitcoin mining output will continue to grow. Into something.\n\nHaris Basit: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Grondahl: Hey, thank you. Hey, Haris, I just wanted to ask, on the November call, there was a significant emphasis on, you know, GPU rental, and that is what Bitdeer Technologies Group wanted to do. And now it seems like you are adjusting that a little bit on some of the larger sites, you know, colocation. Can you just talk about pivot away or why you are seemingly deemphasizing GPU rental at some of those large sites?\n\nHaris Basit: Maybe, Jihan, do you want to do that answer first, and then I can chime in if there is still.\n\nJihan Wu: Yes. I as an on the very live site, colocation is kind of very natural and good choice for a company. And for GPU rental, we have a smaller size Washington State and Tennessee State. We can absolutely handle that ourselves. And maybe a larger capacitors for a lot of interest is besides, like, 10 megawatts or 50 megawatts. They want the nitrocytes anyway, and the nitrocytes in before company better to have some coefficient deal.\n\nHaris Basit: Do you have another question, Mike?\n\nMike Grondahl: No. So hey. Just so I understand, you have just sort of the larger sites, you will go colocation. The smaller ones, you go GPU rental. I guess that was kinda my takeaway. Is that fair?\n\nHaris Basit: Yes. That is correct. Got it.\n\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line Steven Glagola of KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Glagola: Hey, thanks for the question. I have two. First for Haris. I would like to clarify whether Bitdeer Technologies Group’s US AI cloud expansion and potential expansion in Washington and Tennessee is dependent on securing multiyear reserve capacity agreements? And if so, one of those commitments would primarily be for bare metal deployments. That is one. And then second, for Jihan and Matt, you know, it would be helpful to hear your perspective on why USA cloud expansion is strategically attractive at this stage. You know, how do you think about sort of long-term competitive advantages in AI cloud as you broaden beyond your current Asia-centric footprint? Thank you.\n\nHaris Basit: So the first part, our expansion of GPU in the United States is dependent on, you know, signing contracts, at least any significant large-scale expansion is. You know, we can speculatively do small expansion in the United States. But as we said in the statement, anything significant would be backed by contracts.\n\nJihan Wu: And we have our own data centers. I think that is very important advantage right now in the US market. Means that under the end of this year, we will be able to deploy the H300 and about rubings with our own data centers. In the United States right now is the center of AI innovation globally. The demand in US market is so much stronger than any other market. And also the US customers also just one. Capacity on US soil. So we have this kind of capacity in US. And we are going to build it, and then we can build it. We will finish it.\n\nI think this will be the most important advantage on the market right now.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitdeer Technologies Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitdeer Technologies Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "On February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) , acquiring 214,891 shares in an estimated $55.59 million trade based on quarterly average pricing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners initiated a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp., purchasing 214,891 shares. The estimated transaction value was $55.59 million, calculated using the average price during the quarter. The fund’s quarter-end stake in MSGS was valued at $55.59 million, with the net position change reflecting both purchase volume and share price fluctuation in the period.\n\nThis was a new position for the fund, representing 1.66% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\n\nTop five holdings after the filing:\n\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\n\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares of MSGS were priced at $279.76, up 34.3% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 19.92 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\n$6.73 billion\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$1.07 billion\n\nNet Income (TTM)\n\n($16.56 million)\n\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n\n$279.76\n\nOperates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (NBA), New York Rangers (NHL), development league teams, and esports organizations\n\nOwns and manages sports assets, generating revenue from media rights, sponsorships, and merchandising\n\nServes sports fans, media partners, and corporate sponsors, with a focus on the New York metropolitan area and global sports audiences\n\nMadison Square Garden Sports Corp. is a leading owner and operator of major professional sports franchises, leveraging iconic brands such as the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. The company capitalizes on its strong market presence and diversified sports assets to drive revenue from multiple streams, including media, sponsorship, and merchandising. Its strategic focus on marquee teams and premier sports entertainment positions it as a key player in the U.S. sports and entertainment industry.\n\nRecently, Reinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately 215,000 shares of Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (MSGS) valued at around $55.6 million. Here’s what it means for investors.\n\nTo begin, MSGS stock has performed well recently. Over the last five years, shares of MSGS have advanced by 63%, with much of that gain coming in the last year alone. MSGS operates legendary sports franchises, including the New York Rangers and New York Knicks.\n\nAcross sports leagues like the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), franchise values are soaring. In addition, video streaming services and advertisers are desperate to land exclusive rights to must-watch live events, with sports being the most sought-after category.\n\nTherefore, organizations like MSGS (and their associated leagues) now find themselves in a powerful position to negotiate lucrative media rights deals with both local, national, and even international distributors. All that said, MSGS still remains a relatively small company (market cap of around $6 billion). Moreover, it remains stubbornly unprofitable, with a net income of ($16.6 million) over the last 12 months.\n\nTo close, investors may want to tread with caution. While MSGS stock does have great potential, its lack of consistent profitability could hold it back. Those interested in sports stocks would be wise to consider this list of best sports stocks to buy in 2026 .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Madison Square Garden Sports, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Madison Square Garden Sports wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "On February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a significant buy of Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) , adding 537,726 shares in a transaction estimated at $95.28 million based on quarterly average pricing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners increased its holding in Paycom by 537,726 shares. The estimated transaction value was $95.28 million, based on the average closing price during the quarter. At quarter-end, the value of the stake rose by $82.74 million compared to the prior period, a figure that includes both the impact of share purchases and market price changes.\n\nThe move was a buy, resulting in Paycom accounting for 2.9% of the fund’s reportable assets as of December 31, 2025.\n\nTop holdings after the filing:\n\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\n\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\n\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares were priced at $124.94, down 38.5% over the past year and trailing the S&P 500 by 53.0 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$2.00 billion\n\nNet income (TTM)\n\n$453.20 million\n\nDividend yield\n\n1.3%\n\nProvides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and analytics applications.\n\nOperates a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, generating recurring revenue from subscription fees for its suite of integrated HCM tools.\n\nServes small to mid-sized businesses in the United States seeking comprehensive workforce management and compliance solutions.\n\nPaycom provides cloud-based HCM software delivered through a SaaS model, offering end-to-end workforce management solutions for small to mid-sized businesses in the United States.\n\nReinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately $95 million worth of Paycom shares during the fourth quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2025). Here’s what investors should take away from this transaction.\n\nFirst off, it’s important to contextualize this purchase. Paycom shares have been in steady decline for several years. Indeed, since 2021, Paycom stock has fallen by roughly 70%. While there are many reasons for this slide, the biggest has to be the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMany analysts are concerned that AI will serve as a replacement to many ‘off-the-shelf’ software products — particularly in the field of payroll and human resources. That would be a major problem for Paycom, whose business model revolves around the sale of such products. What’s more, the concern isn’t simply theoretical. Paycom’s revenue growth has slowed from 30% in 2021 to under 10% in 2025.\n\nThat’s not to say that Paycom stock can’t bounce back. However, given the rapid development of AI, SaaS companies like Paycom remain at risk. While Paycom stock could be the right choice for investors betting on a turnaround, average investors may be wise to consider these tech stocks to watch in 2026 .\n\nBefore you buy stock in Paycom Software, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paycom Software wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Bitdeer’s Q4 earnings are out (NASDAQ: BTDR), and the financial results show the bitcoin miner increasing its revenue by 225% to $224.8 million over the quarter.\n\nBitdeer booked a net profit of $70.5 million compared to a net loss of $531.9 million in Q4 2024. Bitdeer’s total revenue for the quarter was triple the $69.0 million it reported in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe #1 podcast for emerging tech stocks, Bitcoin, and weekly news analysis. Subscribe to the Blockspace Podcast here, on Apple, Spotify, or anywhere you listen to podcasts.\n\nThe surge in top-line growth stemmed primarily from the expansion of self-mining operations, which generated $168.6 million during the quarter. Bitdeer expanded its proprietary hashrate to 58.0 EH/s, up from 8.9 EH/s in the prior year period, and expanded its total hashrate under management to 71 EH/s.\n\nBitdeer mined 1,673 bitcoin in the quarter, a sharp rise from the 469 bitcoin produced a year earlier. It improved its bitcoin mining fleet efficiency to 17.9 J/TH as the firm replaced older machines with its proprietary SEALMINER rigs.\n\nBitdeer sales of SEALMINER rigs and accessories contributed $23.4 million to quarterly revenue. Bitdeer recently taped out its new SEAL-DL1 chip for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining as production of its bitcoin mining rigs topped 65 EH/s in January.\n\nBitdeer earned $2.3 million from its HPC and AI Cloud segment for the quarter. The firm recently deployed NVIDIA GB200 systems in a Malaysian data center to service AI workloads. This move aligns with Bitdeer’s stated dual-track strategy to leverage high-performance computing demand.\n\nThe company’s management outlined a strategic shift toward AI/HPC infrastructure, prioritizing colocation models for its largest power assets. Matt Kong, Chief Business Officer, noted the firm plans to prioritize colocation for sites like Tydal, Norway, and Clarington, Ohio, to capture superior economics.\n\nThe timeline for the 570 MW Clarington project remains under review following legal complications. Bitdeer faces a lawsuit from a neighboring tenant alleging the data center plans violate shared infrastructure rights. This dispute has introduced uncertainty regarding the deployment schedule for one of the company’s largest sites under development.\n\nBitdeer’s balance sheet featured $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, with an additional 2,017 bitcoin valued at approximately $218.6 million. Bitdeer’s debt stands at $1.0 billion following recent convertible note issuances.",

      "Content": "Revenue surged 225.8% YoY to $224.8 million in Q4 2025, but gross profit fell to $10.6 million (4.7% margin) as a ~13% lower average Bitcoin price, higher electricity costs and a shift to a three‑year depreciation schedule materially pressured profitability.\n\nBitdeer is rapidly scaling self‑mining and hardware: self‑mining revenue hit $168.6 million, the company exited 2025 with >55 EH/s and topped >63 EH/s in January, began mass production of SEALMINER A3 and plans SEAL04‑1 volume production in Q1 2026 (SEAL‑DL1 Litecoin chip taped out).\n\nThe firm is pivoting toward AI/HPC colocation and GPU-as-a-Service with 1.66 GW online and a 3 GW pipeline (key sites Tydal, Clarington, Rockdale), while reporting heavy cash use (net operating cash outflow $599.5 million), ~$1.0 billion of borrowings and a switch to GAAP reporting in Q1 2026.\n\nInterested in Bitdeer Technologies Group? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\n4 Blockchain Stocks That Aren’t Coinbase\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $224.8 million, up 225.8% year over year and 32.5% sequentially, as the company highlighted continued scale-up in self-mining and growing focus on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure opportunities. Management described the quarter as a period of “execution and strategic progress” as Bitdeer positions itself as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Bitdeer posted gross profit of $10.6 million, representing a gross margin of 4.7%, down from 24.1% in the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.2 million, compared with $39.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $4.3 million in Q4 2024.\n\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\n\nBeyond the Halving: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nChief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the sequential decline in profitability primarily reflected a 13% lower average Bitcoin price versus Q3 2025, a roughly 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit driven mainly by winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites, and “substantially higher depreciation expense” tied to rapid expansion of self-mining capacity. The company also increased headcount to support mining operations and AI/HPC initiatives and incurred higher year-end compensation and corporate activity costs.\n\nBitdeer also changed its depreciation methodology to a more conservative approach, moving to a three-year straight-line method for mining rigs compared with a prior five-year useful life assumption, which contributed to higher depreciation expense.\n\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nSelf-mining revenue was $168.6 million, up from $41.5 million in Q4 2024 and $130.9 million in Q3 2025. Management attributed the quarter-over-quarter increase to a higher average operating hash rate and Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and a gradual rise in global network hash rate.\n\nBitdeer also reported $23.4 million in SEALMINER sales revenue, up 105.4% from $11.4 million in Q3 2025.\n\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nOn fleet expansion, Basit said Bitdeer exited 2025 with more than 55 exahash per second (EH/s) of self-mining hash rate and added another 8 EH/s in January, exiting the month at more than 63 EH/s. As of January 31, 2026, overall fleet efficiency stood at 17.5 joules per terahash, with SEALMINER A2 and A3 rigs operating at approximately 15–16.5 J/TH and 12.5–14 J/TH, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bitdeer commenced mass production of the SEALMINER A3 series, with initial shipments beginning in November and 8.7 EH/s deployed to date. Basit said mass production of rigs based on the SEAL04-1 chip is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026, while SEAL04-2 remains under development at the company’s U.S.-based design center. Bitdeer also announced it taped out a Litecoin chip (SEAL-DL1) designed for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, with initial test results said to exceed comparable rigs in energy efficiency and hash rate. CEO Jihan Wu noted the company expects “99% or 98%” of operations to remain Bitcoin-focused, while adding that small-scale altcoin mining could improve yields on certain capacity.\n\nIn Q&A, management said there is a Bitcoin price level that could prompt the company to slow mining activity, but it “hasn’t reached it yet,” adding that higher-efficiency portions of the fleet could operate through further price declines while older machines would be turned off first.\n\nBitdeer emphasized progress on its global power and infrastructure footprint. Basit said the company had more than 1.66 gigawatts (GW) of capacity online at the end of January and a total global power pipeline of 3 GW. Management said it is prioritizing colocation services at AI-suitable sites in Norway and the U.S., reflecting increased demand for large-scale colocation capacity.\n\nKey site updates included:\n\nTydal, Norway: A 225-megawatt facility built to Tier 3 data center specifications. Basit said retrofit capex should be lower than typical greenfield Tier 3 development benchmarks of $8 million to $12 million per MW. The site uses hydropower and includes independent 100 MW transformers for redundancy. Management said it is in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expects to be able to announce a signed lease “as soon as possible in 2026,” though timing is difficult to predict. In Q&A, Basit said estimated PUE is around 1.1, citing hydropower, cold climate, and chilled water availability from a nearby lake. He added the company expects completion of the Tydal site by the end of the year, with production GPU installation at the beginning of next year.\n\nClarington (U.S.): A 570-megawatt site where the local utility has accelerated the interconnection timeline, and the company is in discussions with “well recognizable companies” as prospective tenants. Management disclosed litigation has been filed that could delay development, but said it believes it has a strong defense and is exploring alternatives to mitigate impact.\n\nRockdale (Texas): Bitdeer said it is evaluating acquisition of adjacent land to develop greenfield HPC capacity while maintaining its existing 563 MW Bitcoin mining operation. Management said it believes expected additional capacity of up to 179 MW should not be affected by recent ERCOT discussions, though regulations remain under discussion.\n\nWu characterized the company’s approach as using colocation for very large sites while pursuing GPU-as-a-Service for smaller sites such as Washington State and Tennessee/Knoxville, where Bitdeer believes it can manage deployments directly.\n\nBitdeer said it continues to see opportunities for GPU-as-a-Service in targeted markets and is expanding its cloud platform in Malaysia by 10–15 MW, building on activity in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming. In the U.S., the company plans to add 10 MW of GPU capacity in Washington State and is evaluating a partial conversion of its Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud.\n\nManagement stressed that significant U.S. GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customer contracts and that it does not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. In response to an analyst question, Basit reiterated that major U.S. AI cloud expansion is dependent on signing contracts.\n\nOn Malaysia, management said the infrastructure is being leased. Wu added the timeline to deploy GPUs depends on infrastructure readiness, noting it was expected around June but that delays are common; he suggested Q3 or Q4 as a more conservative estimate.\n\nBitdeer reported net cash used for operating activities of $599.5 million, which management said was primarily driven by SEALMINER supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs, corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97.9 million, including $50.7 million of capital expenditures and $150.6 million in proceeds from cryptocurrency disposals. Net cash generated from financing activities was $454.5 million, driven mainly by $388.5 million of proceeds from convertible senior notes, $168 million in related-party borrowings, and $141.5 million of proceeds from shares sold under its ATM and ELOC program, partially offset by $171.1 million in repayments.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Bitdeer ended the year with $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $83.1 million in cryptocurrencies held at cost less impairment, $135.6 million in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1.0 billion in borrowings, excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities tied to convertible senior notes were $501.1 million, which management said reflected non-cash fair value adjustments and did not impact liquidity or operations.\n\nFor capital spending, Bitdeer said full-year 2025 infrastructure capex totaled $176 million. For 2026, it anticipates $180 million to $200 million of infrastructure spend for crypto mining data center construction, excluding capex for SEALMINERS, GPUs, AI cloud, and colocation.\n\nBasit also noted the company will begin using GAAP instead of IFRS starting in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:BTDR) is a global digital asset mining and computing services provider focused on delivering secure and efficient hashrate solutions to institutional and retail customers.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $159, citing valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 30% year-to-date. Shopify's \"strong\" quarter, continued growth momentum and the post-earnings pullback \"represents an attractive entry point for investors to own the de facto modern-day eCommerce infrastructure,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho also upgraded Shopify to Outperform from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $150.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded BorgWarner (BWA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $82, up from $46. The firm says the company's entrance into the AI data center market is a \"pivotal shift.\"\n\nBarclays upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $375, up from $315. The company has the highest industrial exposure within the analog group \"by far\" and a strong correlation between its sales growth and the Purchasing Managers' Index, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nJPMorgan upgraded MercadoLibre (MELI) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $2,800, up from $2,650.

      "Content": "Investing.com -- Barclays upgraded Analog Devices to Overweight in a note Thursday, arguing the company is best positioned to benefit from an improving industrial backdrop and carries “the cleanest operating model and balance sheet” in the group.\n\nAnalyst Tom O’Malley said purchasing manager indexes have finally provided “the PMI inflection needed for some broader Industrial recovery,” though he cautioned that scars remain from the last cycle.\n\nBarclays noted that inventories at distributors have normalised, but “company inventories remain historically high impacting loadings and utilization, and impairing margins.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the bank sees emerging growth tied to data-center trends but remains selective across analog names. O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\n\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\n\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\n\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\n\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\n\nRelated articles\n\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\n\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marvell-technology-inc-mrvl-trending-140005205.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMarvell is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +80.9%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.51 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.18 billion and $10.04 billion estimates indicate +41.9% and +22.7% changes, respectively.\n\nMarvell reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMarvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This suggests that the year is off to a far better start than anticipated. Additionally, Silicon Motion expects Q1 operating margins of 16% to 18%, indicating higher profitability.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Monolithic Power (MPWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Monolithic Power's main business drivers.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, based in Kirkland, WA, designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. The company focuses on the market for high-performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs).\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s products are widely used in industrial applications, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud computing, and automotive and consumer applications.\n\nBeing a fabless company, Monolithic works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\n\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.14. This compares to a loss of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -430.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -481.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $224.84 million for the quarter ended December 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nBITDEER TEC GRP shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.\n\nWhile BITDEER TEC GRP has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BITDEER TEC GRP was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $203.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.15 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Cricut, Inc. (CRCT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2025. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nCricut, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $198.69 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The stock, metals, and crypto markets have been completely dislocated for four months, with each dancing to its own drummer. Going back to the late 1960s, the S&P 500 and gold have been highly correlated at times and highly negatively correlated at other times. Over that period, gold and silver have had a very negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (USD), as most of the great advances in the metals have occurred during long periods of dollar weakness, and vice versa. One might think that a weak USD would coincide with strong stock-market returns, but that's just not always the case. Starting in 2014, Bitcoin (BTC) was negatively correlated with the USD. The first two massive runs by BTC occurred when the USD was weak, while two of the BTC bear markets occurred when the USD was trending higher. That negative correlation seemed to break in 2024, and there have been periods of risk-on behavior when BTC has been highly correlated with the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). Those times include 2017, March 2020 until November 2021, and a number of times since the end of the 2022 bear market. But the BTC and QQQ correlation has also been busted of late. BTC topped in October 2025 and has witnessed a nasty bear market, while the QQQ has gone sideways since October. John Murphy was the first technician to write about Intermarket Technical Analysis in his 1991 book, and he offers an important lesson: some correlations have (for the most part) lasted for decades and others that simply last until they don't. Investors have to be flexible or the markets will throw them to the wolves.",

      "Content": "We recently published 10 Stocks Turning Heads With Double-Digit Returns . Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) was one of the best performers on Wednesday.\n\nGlobalfoundries jumped to an over one-year high on Wednesday, as investors gobbled up shares after the company swung to profitability last year, marking a 439 percent improvement year-on-year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) said that it swung to a net income of $888 million in 2025 from a $262 million net loss in 2024. This came despite a mere 1 percent uptick in net revenues at $6.79 billion from $6.75 billion year-on-year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter alone, net income stood at $200 million, reversing a $729 million net loss in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues, however, were flat at $1.83 billion.\n\nFollowing the results, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) saw its intra-day share price on Wednesday jump to as much as $48.88 before trimming a few cents to finish the session just up by 16.32 percent at $48.74 apiece.\n\nIn other news, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) announced plans to buy back $500 million worth of its common shares in a bid to boost shareholder value.\n\nThe buyback may be implemented from time to time, through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions, among others.\n\nThe initiative will run for a period of 12 months and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at anytime.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GFS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-incorporated-nasdaq-txn-110015581.html",
      "Content": "The projected fair value for Texas Instruments is US$175 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\nTexas Instruments' US$227 share price signals that it might be 29% overvalued\n\nOur fair value estimate is 20% lower than Texas Instruments' analyst price target of US$219\n\nDoes the February share price for Texas Instruments Incorporated ( NASDAQ:TXN ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model .\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n2026\n\n2027\n\n2028\n\n2029\n\n2030\n\n2031\n\n2032\n\n2033\n\n2034\n\n2035\n\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\n\nUS$6.36b\n\nUS$7.42b\n\nUS$7.97b\n\nUS$8.80b\n\nUS$12.1b\n\nUS$13.6b\n\nUS$15.0b\n\nUS$16.1b\n\nUS$17.2b\n\nUS$18.2b\n\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\n\nAnalyst x14\n\nAnalyst x15\n\nAnalyst x7\n\nAnalyst x2\n\nAnalyst x1\n\nEst @ 12.53%\n\nEst @ 9.80%\n\nEst @ 7.88%\n\nEst @ 6.54%\n\nEst @ 5.60%\n\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%\n\nUS$5.7k\n\nUS$6.0k\n\nUS$5.9k\n\nUS$5.9k\n\nUS$7.3k\n\nUS$7.4k\n\nUS$7.3k\n\nUS$7.1k\n\nUS$6.9k\n\nUS$6.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 3.4%) ÷ (11%– 3.4%) = US$257b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$257b÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = US$93b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$159b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$227, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.639. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nThreat\n\nDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

      "Content": "The most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nHappily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity , or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Skyworks Solutions, Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:SWKS ) recent soft profit numbers didn't appear to worry shareholders, as the stock price showed strength. Our analysis suggests that investors may have noticed some promising signs beyond the statutory profit figures.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nMany investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow , but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\".\n\nSkyworks Solutions has an accrual ratio of -0.13 for the year to January 2026. That implies it has good cash conversion, and implies that its free cash flow solidly exceeded its profit last year. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$1.1b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$394.3m. Skyworks Solutions' free cash flow actually declined over the last year, which is disappointing, like non-biodegradable balloons. However, that's not all there is to consider. We can see that unusual items have impacted its statutory profit, and therefore the accrual ratio.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nSkyworks Solutions' profit was reduced by unusual items worth US$59m in the last twelve months, and this helped it produce high cash conversion, as reflected by its unusual items. This is what you'd expect to see where a company has a non-cash charge reducing paper profits. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If Skyworks Solutions doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nConsidering both Skyworks Solutions' accrual ratio and its unusual items, we think its statutory earnings are unlikely to exaggerate the company's underlying earnings power. Based on these factors, we think Skyworks Solutions' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Skyworks Solutions has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nAfter our examination into the nature of Skyworks Solutions' profit, we've come away optimistic for the company. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity , or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Track your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nCadence Design Systems (NasdaqGS:CDNS) has introduced the ChipStack AI Super Agent, described as a first-of-its-kind agentic AI solution for front-end silicon design and verification.\n\nThe platform uses multiple virtual engineers powered by Cadence’s existing EDA tools, with the company indicating potential productivity gains of up to tenfold in chip design workflows.\n\nEarly adoption by Nvidia and Qualcomm, along with Cadence’s investment in robotics AI, points to growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to semiconductor and intelligent device development.\n\nFor you as an investor, this update sits at the intersection of electronic design automation and accelerating AI chip development. Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\n\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\n\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\n\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nThe ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\n\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\n\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\nHigher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\n\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\n\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\n\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nFrom here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons. You might also track how Cadence links ChipStack with newer areas such as robotics AI, since success there would show that its AI tools can extend beyond classic semiconductor design into a broader intelligent-device market.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Cadence Design Systems, head to the community page for Cadence Design Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Microchip Technology’s fourth-quarter results reflected the impact of architectural modernization in its end markets, particularly automotive and industrial, as well as sustained improvement in inventory correction across distribution channels. Management pointed to robust growth from networking, data center, and FPGA product lines as the primary drivers of the outperformance, with CEO Steve Sanghi noting, “Microcontrollers and analog businesses were both about flat sequentially, which was well above the typical seasonal level for December.” The quarter benefited from increased demand in aerospace and defense, while the distribution inventory correction reached a more normalized level, supporting stable operating margins and cash flow.\n\nIs now the time to buy MCHP? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\n\nRevenue: $1.19 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.18 billion (15.6% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $0.44 vs analyst estimates of $0.43 (2.7% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $402 million vs analyst estimates of $401.6 million (33.9% margin, in line)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.26 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.50 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.49\n\nOperating Margin: 12.8%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year\n\nInventory Days Outstanding: 201, up from 198 in the previous quarter\n\nMarket Capitalization: $43.7 billion\n\nWhile we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\n\nMatthew Prisco (Cantor Fitzgerald) asked about the sustainability of above-seasonal growth and the drivers behind backlog strength. CFO Eric Bjornholt explained that distribution inventory is largely corrected, with strong backlog and bookings for the next quarter, but noted visibility beyond the current quarter remains limited due to short lead times.\n\nVivek Arya (Bank of America Securities) questioned the timeline for reaching the company’s long-term gross margin target. CEO Steve Sanghi and CFO Bjornholt said margin improvement will be gradual, with normalization of inventory reserves and underutilization charges, but did not commit to a specific timeframe.\n\nJim Snyder (Goldman Sachs) inquired about customer inventory behavior and the potential for restocking. Sanghi indicated restocking has not started broadly, but increased expedite requests suggest customer inventories are nearing consumption rates, especially as supply tightens.\n\nBlayne Curtis (Jefferies) asked about the sustainability of licensing and other segment revenue, and the impact on gross margin. Management clarified the licensing benefit will not repeat, but other product lines—including memory and FPGA—are expected to remain strong, supporting gross margin.\n\nChris Caso (Wolfe Research) pressed on the prioritization of debt reduction over share buybacks. Sanghi and Bjornholt emphasized a conservative approach, with no plans for repurchases until leverage is significantly reduced, following lessons from the recent downcycle.\n\nIn coming quarters, the StockStory team will be monitoring (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from automotive Ethernet and industrial connectivity design wins, (2) normalization of customer and channel inventories and its effect on order patterns and lead times, and (3) progress toward improving gross margin through a richer product mix and higher factory utilization. Developments in data center and aerospace/defense segments will also be key to tracking growth.\n\nMicrochip Technology currently trades at $80.73, up from $78.04 just before the earnings.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-txn-buy-sell-040422738.html",
      "Content": "Over the past six months, Texas Instruments has been a great trade, beating the S&P 500 by 9.4%. Its stock price has climbed to $226.03, representing a healthy 17.1% increase. This run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\n\nIs now the time to buy Texas Instruments, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it’s free .\n\nWe’re happy investors have made money, but we're swiping left on Texas Instruments for now. Here are three reasons why TXN doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nA company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, Texas Instruments’s sales grew at a mediocre 4.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the semiconductor sector. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\n\nSadly for Texas Instruments, its EPS declined by 1.8% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 4.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\n\nAs you can see below, Texas Instruments’s margin dropped by 19.6 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it’s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Texas Instruments’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 14.7%.\n\nTexas Instruments isn’t a terrible business, but it doesn’t pass our bar. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 34.5× forward P/E (or $226.03 per share). While this valuation is fair, the upside isn’t great compared to the potential downside. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere. We’d recommend looking at one of our top software and edge computing picks .\n\nThe market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\n\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Kadant (+351% five-year return).

Find the list for free.\n\nTo own Microchip, you need to believe its embedded control franchise can translate rising demand for connected, AI-capable devices into durable, higher quality earnings while it works through elevated inventory and a still-leveraged balance sheet. The new full-stack edge AI platform supports the AI-driven embedded control catalyst story, but does not change that the key near term swing factor is how quickly inventories normalize and factory underutilization charges ease, with high debt remaining a central risk.\n\nAmong recent announcements, the launch of the MCPF1525 high density power module for PCIe switches and AI servers ties directly into the same AI and edge compute theme as the MCU and MPU edge AI stack. Together, they broaden Microchip’s participation in AI related workloads, from ultra low power endpoints to data center infrastructure, which could matter for revenue momentum if the current recovery in industrial, auto and data center demand holds.\n\nYet, while edge AI expansion looks promising, investors should still be aware of the company’s high leverage and the possibility that prolonged inventory normalization could...\n\nRead the full narrative on Microchip Technology (it's free!)\n\nMicrochip Technology's narrative projects $6.6 billion revenue and $1.4 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Get insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\n\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\n\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\n\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\n\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\n\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nThe SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\n\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\n\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nFrom here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marvell-mrvl-esop-share-filings-220939663.html",
      "Content": "In recent days, Marvell Technology filed two employee stock ownership plan-related shelf registrations to offer a combined 4,373,572 common shares worth about US$333.80 million.\n\nThese filings come as Marvell leans further into AI-focused data center silicon, following acquisitions that deepen its role in hyperscaler infrastructure.\n\nWe’ll now examine how Marvell’s ESOP-related share registrations, alongside its expanding AI data center role, shape the existing investment narrative.\n\nOutshine the giants: these 26 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement .\n\nTo own Marvell today, you need to believe its pivot toward AI and cloud data center silicon can offset rising revenue concentration risk in a handful of hyperscale customers. Near term, the key catalyst remains AI data center demand and large custom silicon ramps, while the biggest risk is any slowdown or insourcing by those same customers. The new ESOP-related shelf registrations look immaterial to that core thesis and do not change the main risk reward balance.\n\nThe most relevant context for these ESOP filings is Marvell’s recently reported Q3 FY2026 results, where AI-driven data center revenue helped deliver record US$2,074.5 million in quarterly sales. That print underlined how central AI infrastructure has become to the story and why investors are focused on upcoming catalysts like the March 5 earnings call and updates on hyperscaler programs, rather than on routine share registration activity tied to employee ownership plans.\n\nYet despite this strong AI momentum, investors should still be aware that Marvell’s heavy dependence on hyperscaler data center capex leaves the business exposed if those spending plans suddenly change...\n\nRead the full narrative on Marvell Technology (it's free!)\n\nMarvell Technology's narrative projects $12.1 billion revenue and $2.9 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 18.7% yearly revenue growth and a $3.0 billion earnings increase from -$103.4 million today.\n\nUncover how Marvell Technology's forecasts yield a $116.27 fair value , a 42% upside to its current price.\n\nSome of the most optimistic analysts were assuming revenue could climb about 23.5 percent annually to roughly US$13.6 billion by 2028, yet the latest AI centric news and Marvell’s growing dependence on hyperscaler capex show how sharply opinions can differ and why you should weigh several viewpoints before deciding what this stock is really worth.\n\nExplore 26 other fair value estimates on Marvell Technology - why the stock might be worth as much as 89% more than the current price!\n\nDisagree with existing narratives?

It maintained a Neutral rating. Mizuho predicted that global handset shipments will drop 4% year over year in 2026, with additional declines anticipated in the second half. This is due to memory constraints and pricing pressures. The downgrade came after an industry call on handsets.\n\nOn February 5, 2026, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) expected second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, both lower than LSEG projections. The firm attributed a global memory chip shortage to impacting smartphone users. After-hours trading saw a 9% decline in shares, which have now dropped more than 13% this year as of February 5, 2026. According to CEO Cristiano Amon, memory limits were the only reason for the projection failure. OEMs, especially in China, were cutting back on inventory as memory prices rose across the mobile device industry.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and distributes semiconductors, software, and wireless technology solutions.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-shares-drop-15-post-165700060.html",
      "Content": "KLA Corporation KLAC shares dropped 15.1% post second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Jan. 29. The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares? Let’s find out?\n\nKLA shares have jumped 90.6% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 23.1% and the Zacks Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry’s appreciation of 37.4%. KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, ASML Holding ASML and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, ASML Holding and Axcelis have returned 81.9%, 87% and 48.1%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to grow mid-to-high teens on a year-over-year basis in 2026. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects the core WFE market to grow in the high single to low double digits in 2026, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025. The company expects the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to roughly $12 billion for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus its forecast for 2025.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $36.58 per share, up 3% over the past 30 days and indicating 9.9% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.39 billion, suggesting 10.1% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.12 per share, up 2.4% over the past 30 days and indicating 8.4% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting 9.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nKLAC shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 33.83X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 26.08X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 32.21X and 20.17X, respectively. However, ASML is pricey with a P/E multiple of 41.48.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKLA benefits from strong demand for advanced packaging despite increasing lead times and conservative guidance. Robust AI demand bodes well for KLAC’s prospects and justifies a premium valuation.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which suggests that investors should start accumulating the stock right now as the dip offers a massive opportunity.

      "Content": "Pre-market trading took a nice jump higher on this morning&rsquo;s long-awaited (government-delayed) non-farm payrolls report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . That&rsquo;s because headline jobs numbers reached their highest single-month level since December 2024 to +130K &mdash; double what analysts had been expecting. The Unemployment Rate also continued to tick down: +4.3%, down 10 basis points (bps) for the second consecutive month.\n\nThat&rsquo;s a pretty neat improvement, but Wages are downright perfect: up month over month to +0.4% from +0.3% previously, but down to +3.7% year over year, which is the lowest monthly print in since February of 2021. Labor Force Participation was up slightly to 62.5%, while the U-6 read (aka &ldquo;real unemployment&rdquo;) sank to its lowest level since July to 8.0%, down 40 bps month over month.\n\nBy sector, Healthcare led the way once again, at +82K new jobs filled, followed by Social Assistance at +42K and Construction +33K. Interestingly, the biggest growth here was in non-residential construction, perhaps indicating data centers for AI are making their mark in the labor force. Meanwhile, the Federal Government shed -34K jobs last month, and Financial Services lost -22K.\n\nIdeal as much of these headline numbers are, there are a few flies in the ointment. Chief among them was a reassessment of 2025 job growth, which ended the year +584K but has since been revised to a more paltry +181K. Thus, for as nice as today&rsquo;s numbers look, keep in mind there are revisions likely, and they may be to the downside.\n\nIn all, there remain 7.4 million unemployed Americans (among those who had previously been in the workforce, so new college grads don&rsquo;t count), 1.8 million of them the long-term variety. This number increased +400K over the past year. So while the market toasts yet another metric signaling a strengthening economy, we should remain aware that the labor force is not quite as strong as it was just a couple years ago.\n\nPre-market futures are up nicely on this news: the Dow +238 points, +0.46% &mdash; riding higher after another all-time high close Tuesday &mdash; the S&P 500 +40 points, +0.57%, the Nasdaq +196, +0.78% and the small-cap Russell 2000 is currently leading all major indexes at this hour: +24 points, +0.93%.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) beat earnings estimates by 6 cents to 67 cents per share in Q4, but news that the anticipated split into different companies is taking a back seat, as of this morning&rsquo;s report.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsem-tower-revises-model-higher-161800468.html",
      "Content": "By Lisa Thompson\n\nNASDAQ:TSEM\n\nREAD THE FULL TSEM RESEARCH REPORT\n\nAs demand exceeds capacity, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) has decided to accelerate its investment as it sees margins continue to expand from the sale of new products. It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.\n\nFor Q1 2026, Tower guided to revenues of $412 million plus or minus 5%, which results in slightly accelerating year-over-year growth.\n\nAs of last night’s closing price, the company trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.3 EV to estimated sales for 2027. Since its low at $28.54 on April 4, 2025, the stock has rocketed 379%. TSEM trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.5 EV to estimated sales for 2027, higher than its peers, who trade at an average of 5.7x. However, if we look at the components of that average, we see they diverge, with SMIC and Taiwan Semiconductor averaging 8.4x, while slower-growing Global Foundries and United Microelectronics are at or under 3.0x. At 8.4xs, TSEM stock would be worth approximately $175 per share using 2027 revenues. To be conservative, we are raising our price target to $150 as TSEM works to reach those revenue numbers.\n\nQ4 2025 Results\n\nThe biggest revenue contribution in the quarter again came from RF infrastructure, surpassing RF Mobile. In Q4, RF Infrastructure grew 102% to $141 million, up from $107 million in Q3 2025, and showed growth of 81.3% for the year. SiPh was $95 million of that (including some NREs) for the quarter and grew 70%. For the year, SiPh contributed $228 million compared to $106 million the year before. The growth rates are accelerating as well as the percent contribution to total sales. As they become a bigger portion of total revenues, growth should continue to accelerate.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mrvl-declines-8-3-months-154800725.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology MRVL shares have lost 8.2% in the past three months, underperforming its Computer and Technology sector, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and peers like Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Micron Technology MU.\n\nShares of Broadcom and NVIDIA have lost 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively, while Micron Technology shares have surged 52.4%. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry appreciated 2.7% in the same time frame compared with no change for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven this decline in a month, the question arises: Should investors buy, sell or hold the stock at present? Let’s dive deeper into the fundamentals and financials of the MRVL stock to answer this question.\n\nMarvell Technology’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 signals softer near-term growth. The company guided revenues of $2.2 billion (+/- 5%), representing just 21% year-over-year growth, a slowdown compared to recent quarters. The top line has been in a declining trend for the past three quarters.\n\nDespite strong demand for electro-optics, management expects data center revenues to grow 20% year over year in the fourth quarter, suggesting a decelerating growth rate in the past six quarters. One of the major reasons for this decelerating growth is the growing presence of players like Broadcom and Astera Labs in the AI connectivity space.\n\nBroadcom is strong in networking, data center, broadband, Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHYs and switches. In the communications segment, Broadcom mainly provides high-speed connectivity, optical or wireline networking equipment, cable or broadband IC portfolio, PCIe switch and retimer.\n\nMarvell Technology’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with a 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system. The volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\n\nThe company recently launched the Golden Cable initiative to accelerate and expand the Active Electrical Cable ecosystem for faster deployment of AI infrastructure by cloud and hyperscaler customers. MRVL is also gaining from the adoption of scale-up switches that connect AI accelerators within and across racks, requiring multi-terabit bandwidth and ultra-low latency.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Micron Technology and NVIDIA, are in the AI processing, networking and memory space. Besides semiconductor partners, MRVL has collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nMicron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth. MRVL has collaborated with MU on HBM design and integration for AI compute platforms to provide a custom HBM compute architecture.\n\nThe growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Marvell Technology has partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution.\n\nTogether with its deep expertise in the AI semiconductor space and strong partner base, the company is able to keep its operating costs low and grow its top line at the same time, hence benefiting from a high growth rate in the bottom line. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, non-GAAP operating expenses grew just 4% year over year, even as revenues climbed 37% year over year, showcasing disciplined cost management.\n\nThe consensus estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 81%. The estimate has remained unchanged for the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMRVL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/S) ratio of 6.87, well below the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry average of 8.4, indicating that the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough MRVL’s top line is showing a declining growth rate, the company has been able to retain its earnings growth through prudent cost measures. Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Considering these factors, we suggest investors retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-com-qualcomm-highlighted-zacks-145500161.html",
      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\n\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\n\nA recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\n\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\n\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\n\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\n\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\n\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\n\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\n\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\n\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\n\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\n\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\n\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nQualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\n\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\n\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\n\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\n\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\n\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\n\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\n\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\n\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\n\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nMicron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\n\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\n\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\n\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\n\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\n\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\n\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\n\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\n\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\n\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated Feb. 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners, LLC. increased its position in Yeti by 373,641 shares during the fourth quarter of 2025. The estimated value of the additional shares acquired was $14.37 million, based on the average quarterly closing price. At quarter-end, the total Yeti position was valued at $134.08 million, up approximately $45.76 million from the prior period, reflecting both trading and price movement effects.\n\nAfter this buy, Yeti accounted for approximately 4.02% of 13F reportable AUM at the end of December 2025.\n\nTop holdings after the filing, other than Yeti:\n\nUNK: FCNCA: $167 million (approximately 5.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.9 million (approximately 4.4% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $133 million (approximately 4.0% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.7 million (approximately 3.8% of AUM)\n\nNASDAQ: SKWD: $123.5 million (approximately 3.7% of AUM)\n\nAs of Feb. 10, 2026, shares were priced at $47.06, up approximately 30.2% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 15.79 percentage points.\n\nMetric\n\nValue\n\nMarket capitalization\n\n$3.66 billion\n\nRevenue (TTM)\n\n$1.83 billion\n\nNet income (TTM)\n\n$160.31 million\n\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n\n$47.06\n\nYeti offers hard and soft coolers, drinkware, bags, outdoor living gear, and accessories primarily under the YETI and Rambler brands.\n\nThe company generates revenue through direct-to-consumer e-commerce, independent retailers, and international distribution channels.\n\nIt targets outdoor enthusiasts, recreation consumers, and specialty retail shoppers in the United States and select international markets.\n\nYeti designs premium coolers and drinkware for outdoor enthusiasts, leveraging a multi-channel strategy to reach a broad consumer base. The company is a leading designer and distributor of premium outdoor products, focusing on durable coolers and innovative drinkware. Its consistent growth reflects strong positioning within the leisure and outdoor recreation market.\n\nThis new filing comes about one week before Yeti releases fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2025 financial results on Thursday, Feb. 19. Investment firm Reinhart Partners is clearly confident in the business. But interested investors should watch the upcoming report closely.\n\nThat’s because Yeti’s business has been under pressure recently. Its products are certainly discretionary for consumers who may be looking to tighten their financial spending. That’s not the company’s only issue, either.\n\nIn the third quarter, Yeti’s adjusted earnings per share decreased 14%, even as net sales increased 2%. The company cited the “unfavorable net impact from higher tariff costs in the third quarter” as the reason. Yeti’s international sales actually increased by 14%, while sales in the U.S. declined 1%.\n\nThe company continues to innovate, however. Management is confident enough to increase its share repurchase target to $300 million. Yeti also updated fiscal year guidance slightly to the high end of prior projections for sales and free cash flow.\n\nYeti is also transforming its supply chain and diversifying its manufacturing footprint to address tariff and supplier issues. That work is likely why Reinhart Partners added more Yeti to the portfolio. The upcoming fourth-quarter report will help investors determine whether tariff and supply chain headwinds are now in the past.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Yeti, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Yeti wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\n\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\n\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,353 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,155,789 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 920 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-silicon-motion-140003883.html",
      "Content": "Silicon Motion (SIMO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chip company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Silicon Motion belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +90%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.7%. This estimate has changed +21.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $299.65 million indicates a year-over-year change of +80%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.24 billion and $1.41 billion estimates indicate +39.5% and +14.2% changes, respectively.\n\nSilicon Motion reported revenues of $278.46 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.7%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.61%. The EPS surprise was -2.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Silicon Motion surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSilicon Motion is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The flash-crash rally hit a speed bump on Tuesday after the disappointing December retail sales report.\n\nToday’s January non-farm payrolls report and Friday’s consumer price index numbers could move the markets.\n\nWith earnings for the fourth quarter all but over, economic data could play a bigger role the rest of the month.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nFutures are trading higher after a stellar and surprising January jobs report as we get to the middle of the trading week. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a winning day, closing up 0.20% at 50,188, the disappointment over the December retail sales report hung over the market like a sword of Damocles all day. With today's January non-farm payrolls report and the January consumer price index expected on Friday, economic data could drive markets. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday at 6,941, down 0.33%, while the Nasdaq closed at 23,021, lower by 0.59%. The Russell 2000 declined 0.24% to 2,682.\n\nYields were down again across the Treasury curve, and some traders attributed the buying to forthcoming economic data and the fact that two new voters for the Federal Reserve both stated that the Federal funds rate could remain where it is for some time, as they saw potential for inflation to reignite. The 30-year bond closed at 4.79%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.14%.\n\nPrices were modestly lower across the energy complex, with some attributing the move to profit-taking. Concern over a U.S.-Iranian confrontation remains central, and oil prices could spike if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. Ships were advised earlier this week to avoid Iranian waters, so the threat remains. Brent Crude closed down 0.11% at $68.93, while West Texas Intermediate finished Tuesday at $64.10, down 0.40%. Natural gas ended the day at $3.12, down 0.54%.\n\nGold was lower on Tuesday, as the same issues that weighed on the broader market also affected bullion. One positive noted by traders was that gold held above the $5,000 level, closing at $5,023, down 0.65%. Silver closed at $80.63, down 3.20%\n\nThe cryptocurrency market was range-bound and generally traded lower on Tuesday, as major tokens struggled to sustain recent gains and investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of critical U.S. economic data today and later this week. The crypto market remains pressured by ongoing liquidation-driven selling and a lack of fresh capital to drive prices higher, as evidenced by negative funding rates. Leveraged holders will likely be forced to refinance their holdings. At 8 AM EST, Bitcoin was trading at $67,201, while Ethereum was quoted at $1,957.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\n\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, February 11, 2026.\n\nBETA Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BETA ) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Jefferies with a $30 target price.\n\nCloudflare Inc. ( NYSE: NET ) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, which raised the target price for the stock to $260 from $230.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods Inc. ( NYSE: DKS ) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, and the price target for the retail giant was raised to $253 from $230.\n\nMonro Inc. (NASDAQ: MNRO) was upgraded to Outperform from Perform at Oppenheimer with a $40 target price.\n\nTyler Technologies Inc. (NYSE: TYL ) was raised to Buy from Neutral at DA Davidson, which actually lowered the target price for the company to $460 from $510.\n\nBP Plc. (NYSE: BP) was downgraded to Sell from Buy at Melius Research with a $31 target price.\n\nMattel Inc. (NYSE: MAT ) was downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JPMorgan, which trimmed the target price for the toy giant to $14 from $23.\n\nNoble Corp. plc ( NYSE: NE ) was cut to Hold from Buy at Fearnley with a $38 target price.\n\nQualcomm Inc. ( NASDAQ: QCOM ) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Daiwa, which has a $140 target for the legacy tech giant.\n\nXPO Inc. ( NYSE: XPO ) was cut Neutral from Positive at Susquehanna with a $210 target price.\n\nBridge Bio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. ( NASDAQ: BBOT) was started with a Buy rating at Stifel, which has a $23 target for the stock.\n\nEnergy Fuels Inc. ( NYSE: UUUU ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Goldman Sachs, with a $30 target price.\n\nJefferson Capital Inc. ( NASDAQ: JCAP ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Texas Capital with a $28 target price.\n\nSamsara Inc. ( NYSE: IOT ) was initiated with a Buy rating at Goldman Sachs, which has set a $36 target price objective.\n\nVelo3D Inc. ( NASDAQ: VELO ) was started with a Buy rating at Lucid Capital, with a $25 target price.\n\nMost Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\n\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .",

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Skyworks SWKS and RF Industries RFIL.\n\nIndustry: Electronics - Radio Frequency\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2847030/2-radio-frequency-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry participants like Skyworks and RF Industries are benefiting from the continued adoption of WiFi 7, as well as the rapid proliferation of the edge IoT, AI data centers and automotive electrification. The growing need for faster connections, low latency, and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots.\n\nThe democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry participants. Nevertheless, industry players are facing a challenging demand environment that has resulted in inventory buildup. Sluggish capital spending by telecom carriers has been a headwind. Industry participants are suffering from heightened global macroeconomic uncertainties. Weakness in end-markets like automotive, industrial and infrastructure has been concerning.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in the congested RF spectrum.\n\nThey serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF Industry\n\nAccelerated 5G Deployment Acts as a Tailwind : The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which is expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. The growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects.\n\nInnovation Opens up Business Avenues : The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense.\n\nThe diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. The evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. The rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. Industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.\n\nGrowing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospects : Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #20, which places it in the top 8% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2026 have moved up by 7.4% since June 30, 2025.\n\nGiven the bright prospect, there are a few stocks worth watching in the industry. However, before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry has underperformed the S&P 500 and its broader sector over the past year. The industry has declined 9.6% over this period against the S&P 500&rsquo;s return of 16.8% and the broader sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 21.8%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing the Semiconductors - Radio Frequency stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.51X, lower than the S&P 500&rsquo;s 22.98X and the sector&rsquo;s 25.91X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.71X and as low as 7.89X, the median being 14.65X.\n\n2 Radio Frequency Stocks to Watch\n\nRF Industries : Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have moved up 111.8% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRF Industries benefits from growing adoption of its integrated solutions, with backlog increasing to $15.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. The company is gaining its footprint among wireless, aerospace, public safety and industrial OEM customers. RFIL&rsquo;s prospects ride on diversifying portfolio, customers and end markets, as well as an expanding partner base.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RFIL&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 8 cents to 43 cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nSkyworks : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from positive momentum in demand signals and backlog improvement, especially in automotive electrification, edge IoT, and AI data centers. The growing adoption of Wi-Fi 7 and upcoming Wi-Fi 8 systems drives growth. Strong demand for RF content in real-time video, sensors and software-defined vehicles provides a boost to SWKS&rsquo; prospects.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues between $875 million and $925 million. SWKS expects a roughly 20% decline in Mobile, while Broad markets are expected to remain flat sequentially but grow high single digits year over year.\n\nSkyworks shares have dropped 4.8% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SWKS&rsquo; fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 6.8% to $4.70 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Find your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\n\nLam Research announced a set of senior leadership changes, including the retirement of its COO and the appointment of Sesha Varadarajan to the role.\n\nThe company added Dr. Anirudh Devgan, a key figure in electronic design automation, to its board of directors.\n\nLam also entered a multi year partnership with CEA Leti to work on advanced specialty technology devices and semiconductor materials.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:LRCX, these leadership and partnership moves come on top of a share price of $226.61 and very large multiyear share returns, including about 353.0% over 3 years. The stock is also up 22.5% year to date and about 174.7% over 1 year, which places these corporate decisions in the context of a company that has already seen strong recent market interest.\n\nBoard level changes and deep technical collaborations can influence how Lam Research positions itself in semiconductor equipment over the coming years. If you follow the stock, a key question is how this refreshed leadership team and new partner relationships shape Lam’s role in next generation chip manufacturing technologies.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Lam Research by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Lam Research.\n\nDoes the team leading Lam Research have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\n\nFor you as an investor, the key takeaway is that Lam is tightening the link between executive decision making and the chip design ecosystem while also pushing its process technology into more complex device types. The promotion of long time insider Sesha Varadarajan to COO suggests operational continuity in core etch and deposition tools, which sit at the center of AI and memory manufacturing. Bringing Cadence CEO Anirudh Devgan onto the board ties Lam more closely to electronic design automation, an area that influences how next generation chips are architected before they ever hit a fab. The multi year partnership with CEA Leti broadens Lam’s R&D reach across MEMS, 3D imaging, RF, photonics and optical interconnects, areas that matter for AI hardware, advanced data centers and high performance computing. Taken together with recent earnings strength, guidance and ongoing dividends and buybacks, these leadership and partnership steps frame a company that is actively aligning its internal structure and research pipeline with where complex chip manufacturing is heading, while still leaving you to judge execution quality and competitive outcomes against peers like Applied Materials, KLA and Tokyo Electron.\n\nThe CEA Leti partnership and Varadarajan’s operational role tie directly into the narrative that Lam’s process technology in advanced packaging, etch and deposition can support higher wafer fab equipment demand linked to AI and memory cycles.\n\nAt the same time, board and C suite changes add another layer of execution risk to a story that already leans on continued leadership in complex architectures such as 3D NAND and advanced packaging, where rivals like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron are also investing heavily.\n\nThe appointment of an EDA focused board member and the push into specialty devices and compound semiconductors extend beyond the original narrative, which centers more on core wafer fab equipment and may not fully capture optionality in areas like RF filters, photonics and quantum related applications.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Lam Research to help decide what it's worth to you.\n\n⚠️ Executive transition risk as Lam moves from long serving COO Patrick Lord to Sesha Varadarajan. Any disruption in operations, product execution or customer support is likely to show up quickly in a cyclical equipment market.\n\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged at least one risk, and the partnership and leadership changes sit against a backdrop of customer concentration and strong competition from equipment vendors such as Applied Materials and KLA that could pressure share of future spend.\n\n🎁 The CEA Leti agreement broadens Lam’s reach into specialty technologies such as MEMS, 3D imaging, RF and photonics, which can support its goal of serving a wider range of AI and high performance computing related device needs.\n\n🎁 Recent earnings strength, active capital returns through dividends and buybacks, and a board that now includes a leading EDA executive give Lam additional tools to pursue opportunities in advanced memory and packaging where it already has a meaningful presence.\n\nFrom here, you may want to track how smoothly the COO handover progresses, for example through future commentary on system shipments, service performance and customer satisfaction. Board level influence is slower to read, so watch for any shift in Lam’s product roadmap or R&D focus that ties chip design requirements more tightly to its equipment offerings. On the CEA Leti side, pay attention to concrete milestones such as joint demonstrators, published results or early customer engagements in areas like RF filters, photonics or compound semiconductor processes that use Lam’s etch and deposition tools. Finally, set the leadership and partnership story alongside future quarterly results, guidance and competitive commentary from Applied Materials, KLA and Tokyo Electron to see whether Lam’s positioning in AI infrastructure, memory and specialty technologies continues to align with where capital spending is flowing.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Lam Research, head to the community page for Lam Research to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 50.79% contrasts with a modest 5 year total shareholder return of 4.78%, hinting that enthusiasm around edge AI launches and fresh financing is a relatively recent shift in market sentiment.\n\nIf edge AI and power efficient chips are on your radar, it could be a good moment to widen your watchlist with our screener of 33 AI infrastructure stocks .\n\nAfter such a sharp move in the share price and with a fresh edge AI story in the spotlight, the real question now is whether Microchip still trades at a discount or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\n\nAt $76.86, the most followed narrative pegs Microchip Technology's fair value closer to $86.96, framing the recent AI driven enthusiasm against longer term assumptions.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\n\nCurious what sits behind that fair value gap? Revenue climbing faster than the wider market, margin rebuild, and a future earnings profile that assumes a premium valuation. The exact mix of growth, profitability and required return is already mapped out. You just have to see how bold those forecasts really are.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $86.96 (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\n\nHowever, there are still pressure points to keep in mind, including elevated inventory and factory underutilization charges, as well as substantial debt that can constrain flexibility.\n\nFind out about the key risks to this Microchip Technology narrative.\n\nThere is a twist here. While the popular narrative suggests Microchip Technology is about 12% undervalued with a fair value of $86.96, our DCF model points to a value of $63.58, which would make the current $76.86 price look expensive. Which story do you think fits the risk you are willing to take?\n\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\n\nIf the current fair value story does not quite fit how you see Microchip, you can stress test the assumptions yourself and shape a version that lines up with your own research in just a few minutes. Then Do it your way .\n\nA great starting point for your Microchip Technology research is our analysis highlighting 1 key reward and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n\nDo not stop your research with one company.

Keeping that in mind, here are three profitable companies that don’t make the cut and some better opportunities instead.\n\nTrailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 21.9%\n\nKnown for its memorable Super Bowl commercials that put it on the map, GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is a domain registrar and web services provider that helps entrepreneurs establish an online presence through domain registration, website building, hosting, and e-commerce tools.\n\nWhy Do We Pass on GDDY?\n\nUnderwhelming ARR growth of 8.4% over the last year suggests the company faced challenges in acquiring and retaining long-term customers\n\nDemand will likely be soft over the next 12 months as Wall Street’s estimates imply tepid growth of 6.5%\n\nHigh servicing costs result in a relatively inferior gross margin of 63.6% that must be offset through increased usage\n\nAt $96.62 per share, GoDaddy trades at 2.6x forward price-to-sales.

      "Content": "Shares of analog chips maker onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) jumped 3.1% in the afternoon session after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results where earnings per share beat analyst estimates, but revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter fell short. The analog chip maker posted an adjusted EPS of $0.64, beating the consensus estimate of $0.62. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, in line with expectations but representing an 11.2% decline from the previous year. However, the positive earnings surprise was tempered by the company's forecast for the first quarter, which projected both revenue and earnings below Wall Street's projections. Despite the weak outlook, investors appeared to focus on the better-than-expected profit and a strong free cash flow margin of 31.7% for the quarter. The stock's rally represented a significant reversal from an initial 4.6% drop immediately following the earnings release, suggesting a shift in sentiment as the market digested the full report.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $66.82, up 1.7% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy onsemi? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free .\n\nonsemi’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 18 days ago when the stock dropped 2.7% on the news that Intel reported disappointing earnings report and weak forecast for the current quarter. Shares of the chipmaker plunged about 12% after it posted a fourth-quarter loss and provided a softer-than-expected outlook. The company's first-quarter revenue projections of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion fell short of analyst consensus. More concerning for the broader sector, Intel executives flagged industry-wide supply shortages as a significant problem that could persist into 2026, with supply capabilities expected to be at their lowest point in the first quarter. When a market leader like Intel signals such widespread issues, it often creates a ripple effect, raising investor concerns about the health and near-term prospects of the entire semiconductor industry.\n\nonsemi is up 17.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $66.82 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of onsemi’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,674.\n\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "KLA Corporation recently reported past second-quarter fiscal 2026 results showing higher revenue of US$3,297.15 million and net income of US$1,145.68 million year over year, alongside issuing guidance for third-quarter revenue of about US$3.35 billion and GAAP diluted EPS between US$8.07 and US$9.63.\n\nIn parallel, KLA’s board affirmed a quarterly dividend of US$1.90 per share and the company completed a multi-year share repurchase totaling 18,859,237 shares for US$9.06 billion, underscoring its continued emphasis on returning cash to shareholders while semiconductor demand related to AI investment remains a key theme in its commentary.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we will explore how KLA’s strong earnings performance and capital return program shape the company’s broader investment narrative.\n\nCapitalize on the AI infrastructure supercycle with our selection of the 33 best 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush converting record-breaking demand into massive cash flow.\n\nTo own KLA, you need to be comfortable tying your fortunes to wafer fab equipment spending and, increasingly, AI-driven capacity investments. The latest quarter’s higher revenue and earnings, coupled with Q3 guidance, reinforce that near term demand remains intact for now, even if that may not materially change the existing catalysts around AI-related tool orders and the broader semiconductor capex cycle. The affirmed US$1.90 dividend and completion of a US$9.06 billion buyback fit neatly into KLA’s pattern of returning substantial cash, but they do not remove the key risks: potential swings in wafer fab budgets, high valuation multiples versus “fair” estimates, and reliance on a few large chip manufacturers. Instead, this news mainly strengthens the sense that management is leaning into the current industry upturn.\n\nHowever, investors should also be aware of how quickly wafer fab spending plans can reset. KLA's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? Uncover how much higher they are than fair value .\n\nThe three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$758 to US$1,297 per share, showing how far apart private investors can be. Set against KLA’s strong recent earnings and sizable capital returns, this spread invites you to weigh differing expectations for future AI-driven equipment demand and the risk that spending could cool faster than many anticipate.\n\nExplore 3 other fair value estimates on KLA - why the stock might be worth as much as $1297!\n\nDisagree with this assessment? Create your own narrative in under 3 minutes - extraordinary investment returns rarely come from following the herd.\n\nA great starting point for your KLA research is our analysis highlighting 3 key rewards that could impact your investment decision.\n\nOur free KLA research report provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate KLA's overall financial health at a glance.\n\nThe market won't wait.

      "Content": "ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, as revenue was in line with estimates but down from the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe semiconductor firm posted Q4 revenue of $1.53 billion, in line with analyst expectations.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at $0.64, exceeding expectations of $0.62.\n\nFor the full year, the company generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, achieving a record high free cash flow margin of 24%, which was returned to shareholders through share repurchases.\n\n“We remained disciplined in our execution and met expectations in the fourth quarter as we saw increasing signs of stabilization in our key markets,” ON Semiconductor CEO Hassane El-Khoury said. “We continue to invest in intelligent power and sensing technologies that position us to win in the most critical technology transitions shaping our industry.”\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects first-quarter 2026 revenue of $1.49 billion at the midpoint, slightly below analyst projections of $1.51 billion. Adjusted EPS guidance for the quarter is $0.47 at the midpoint, under analysts’ estimate of $0.61.\n\nJefferies analysts maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on ON Semiconductor with a $73 price target, noting that growth in AI Data Centers is helping offset headwinds from non-core business exits and some industrial lumpiness.\n\nThe analysts noted that AI data center revenue is on a run-rate exceeding $400 million in Q1, while aggregate exits of roughly $300 million are expected across the March, June, and September quarters.\n\nThey highlighted modest improvement in auto and a target of over 40% gross margin by Q4, though they remain cautious on broader analog recovery trends.\n\n“Overall, the outlook is largely unchanged despite the moving pieces,” the firm wrote.\n\nShares of ON Semiconductor added 4.3% on the results, trading at about $68.",

Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\n\nAMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\n\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\n\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nApplied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\n\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although they develop solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holdings develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions like Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in GAA transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nWith these factors in place, AMAT’s long-term growth outlook remains strong.

      "Content": "Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) shares rose after the company -- which sells critical design architecture for making semiconductors -- saw artificial intelligence (AI) demand boost its revenue. The stock, however, has still lost about a third of its value over the past year and it faces a big potential risk next fiscal year. Let's see what that is -- and what investors should do.\n\nAfter an initial dip following its results, Arm shares rallied as investors turned their focus more toward its AI opportunities than worries about smartphones. Arm said it sees its data center business becoming its largest segment in the coming year, and that it will reach a 50% market share among top hyperscalers. This growth is being led by the shift toward inference and AI agents, which it says makes central processing units (CPUs) more important within the data center.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHowever, the company did admit that increasing memory supply constraints could put a dent in smartphone sales, with talk of a potential 15% reduction in volumes over the next year. That said, it noted that even a 20% reduction would only equate to a 2% to 4% effect on its smartphone royalties. However, this company is trading at a growth multiple, so that is a big potential risk.\n\nOverall, Arm's fiscal third-quarter revenue jumped 26% year over year to $1.24 billion. License revenue rose by 25% year over year to $505 million. Its agreement with Softbank contributed $200 million to that total. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by two, to 50. Over half of its top 30 customers use this license. It also added six Arm Flexible Access customers, bringing the total to 318.\n\nRoyalty revenue, meanwhile, rose 27% year over year to $737 million. The growth was driven by increased adoption of newer ARM technology, including Armv9 architecture and Arm CSS (compute subsystems), which carry higher royalty rates. It said five customers are now shipping devices with CSS chips, including the top four Android phone makers.\n\nAnnualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, soared 28% to $1.62 billion. Looking ahead, Arm guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to come in around $1.47 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%. Royalty growth is projected to be up by the low teens and licensing by the high teens. It forecasts that adjusted earnings per share will be between $0.54 and 0.62.\n\nArm's licensing and royalty business model is attractive given its high gross margin and recurring nature, and the company has an opportunity to continue to grow nicely in the data center space. Meanwhile, its ties to Softbank provide a steady stream of growth.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 49 based on analysts' fiscal 2027 consensus, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.7 (with below 1 considered undervalued), ARM looks reasonably priced. However, the likely weakness in the smartphone market next year isn't necessarily embedded in those estimates, and as such, this would keep me on the sidelines for now.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvts-trades-premium-valuation-hold-151800624.html",
      "Content": "Navitas Semiconductor NVTS is currently trading at a high price-to-sales (P/S) multiple compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Navitas Semiconductor’s forward 12-month P/S ratio sits at 49.54X, significantly higher than the industry’s forward 12-month P/S ratio of 8.26X. The Zacks Value Score of F also suggests that NVTS stock is overvalued.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor stock trades at a higher P/S multiple compared with other industry peers, including Lam Research LRCX, Applied Materials AMAT and FormFactor FORM. At present, Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have P/S multiples of 11.58X, 8.46X and 7.69X, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s elevated valuation raises concerns about whether the stock can justify such lofty multiples. Considering the premium valuation, investors must be wondering whether they should buy, hold or sell the stock, especially amid near-term challenges.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor has decided to walk away from its low-margin mobile products to focus its resources on high-power business. This strategic decision is hurting the company’s top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2025, NVTS’s revenues decreased 53.4% year over year to $10.1 million, reflecting adverse impacts from its strategic decision to deprioritize its lower-margin China mobile business.\n\nThe company projects a further decline in its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2025. Navitas Semiconductor expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenues to be $7 million (+/- $0.25 million), down significantly on a sequential basis as the company is pruning its low-margin mobile business to align its resources toward high-power business.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s decision to prune its mobile business seems to have weighed on investors’ sentiments, as reflected by a decline in NVTS’ share price over the past three months. NVTS stock has plunged 11% over the past month, underperforming the industry’s decline of 2.7%.\n\nThe stock has underperformed its industry peers, including Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor. Shares of Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have returned 3.8%, 7.6% and 31%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, for investors, not everything is gloom and doom.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is shifting its focus toward high-power markets, such as AI data centers, performance computing, energy and grid infrastructure, and industrial electrification. This strategic move aligns with the company’s “Navitas 2.0” strategy, under which the company is reallocating resources toward high-power markets, pruning lower-margin mobile business, and working more closely with hyperscalers, graphics processing unit vendors and system OEMs.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s inclusion in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt AI factory ecosystem is an important step. The new architecture shifts data center power distribution from traditional AC/DC stages to a high-voltage DC approach that requires faster, more efficient power electronics. This creates an opening for Navitas Semiconductor’s gallium nitride (GaN) and high-voltage silicon carbide (SiC) technologies, both of which are now part of the NVIDIA-led ecosystem.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Navitas Semiconductor highlighted that it is one of the few companies offering both GaN and SiC solutions across the full power path from the grid to the graphics processing unit. The company has begun sampling mid-voltage GaN devices at 100 volts, which target the last stage of power conversion inside AI servers. It is also sampling 2.3 kV and 3.3 kV SiC modules for grid and energy storage applications that support these new data center designs.\n\nNVTS expects 2026 to be a transition year, with small but growing shipments tied to traditional server power supplies. The larger opportunity depends on how fast hyperscalers adopt the 800-volt architecture and will depend on Navitas Semiconductor's ability to secure multi-generation design wins.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is strengthening its position in high-power markets through strategic partnerships. In mid-December, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its distribution relationship with Avnet, making the latter a globally franchised distribution partner. Under the deal, Avnet will provide technical and commercial support for NVTS’ GaN and SiC products across regions.\n\nIn early December, NVTS entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Cyient Semiconductors to accelerate GaN adoption in India. The two companies plan to co-develop GaN products, system modules and design platforms aimed at high-voltage, high-power markets, such as AI data centers, electric mobility and grid infrastructure.\n\nIn late November, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its partnership with WT Microelectronics in Asia. NVTS is consolidating its distributor base, and WT Microelectronics will take the lead for customer engagement and logistics in Asia, per the partnership agreement. This collaboration is meant to improve support for high-power customers in the region.\n\nIn mid-November, Navitas Semiconductor announced a long-term partnership with GlobalFoundries. Under this collaboration, the two companies will develop and manufacture next-generation GaN power devices at Global Foundries’ Vermont facility, with development planned for early 2026 and production expected later that year.\n\nThese partnerships bode well for the company's prospects as Navitas Semiconductor is trying to prepare for future demand. Through these strategic partnerships, NVTS aims to strengthen its supply chain, improve customer access, and prepare for large future opportunities, once high-power markets begin to scale in 2026 and 2027.\n\nNVTS shares are trading above their 50-day & 200-day moving averages, a bullish technical signal that indicates the potential for continued upward momentum in the near term.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is in a good position to benefit from the fast growth of AI data centers and is making steady progress through its strategic partnerships, which bode well for the company’s prospects and support its long-term growth plans. The company’s GaN and high-voltage SiC products now play a role in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt power setup, which shows that the technology is relevant and in demand.\n\nHowever, Navitas Semiconductor’s premium valuation warrants a cautious approach to the stock.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-txn-reliance-international-141502723.html",
      "Content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Texas Instruments' (TXN) international operations for the quarter ending December 2025? Given the extensive global presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nWhile analyzing TXN's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.42 billion, showing rise of 10.4%. We will now explore the breakdown of TXN's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Japan contributed $290 million in revenue, making up 6.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $297.43 million, this meant a surprise of -2.5%. Looking back, Japan contributed $313 million, or 6.6%, in the previous quarter, and $277 million, or 6.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRest of World generated $98 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 2.2% of the total. This represented a surprise of +26.34% compared to the $77.57 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of World accounted for $74 million (1.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $69 million (1.7%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $948 million came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 21.4%. This represented a surprise of +3.13% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $919.21 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $972 million, or 20.5%, and $786 million, or 19.6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nRest of Asia accounted for 10.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $457 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.19%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $476.96 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Rest of Asia contributed $505 million (10.7%) and $432 million (10.8%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nChina generated $951 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.9% compared to the $933.3 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, China accounted for $1.02 billion (21.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $821 million (20.5%) to the total revenue.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments to report $4.51 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to contribute 6.5% (translating to $293.26 million), 1.7% ($77.37 million), 20.5% ($925.54 million), 10.5% ($473.62 million), and 20.7% ($933.44 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $19.36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 9.5% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to make up 6.4%, 1.7%, 20%, 10.3%, and 20.5% of this total, corresponding to $1.24 billion, $322.14 million, $3.86 billion, $2 billion, and $3.97 billion, respectively.\n\nTexas Instruments' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\n\nTexas Instruments, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .\n\nOver the past month, the stock has gained 15.7% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, of which Texas Instruments is a part, has declined 1.1% over the same period. The company's shares have increased 41.2% over the past three months compared to the S&P 500's 3.7% increase. Over the same period, the sector has risen 2.3%\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "The S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\n\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nEntering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\n\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nAnother stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\n\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\n\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 10, 2026.\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "Stellar P3E MCUs\n\nSTMicroelectronics introduces the first automotive microcontroller with AI acceleration for edge intelligence\n\nStellar P3E automotive microcontroller (MCU) enables real-time AI applications at the edge significantly enhancing vehicle intelligence\n\nSimplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units\n\nDelivers flexible, real-time performance for safe, responsive applications from hybrid/EV systems to body zonal architectures\n\nGeneva, February 10, 2026 -- STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) , a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, today announced the Stellar P3E , the first automotive microcontroller (MCU) with built-in AI acceleration for automotive edge intelligence. Designed for future software-defined vehicles, the Stellar P3E simplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that reduce system cost, weight, and complexity.\n\n“Stellar P3E sets a new benchmark for automotive electrification by combining high-performance real-time control and edge AI in a single device that meets the highest automotive safety levels,” said Luca Rodeschini, Group Vice President and General Purpose and Automotive Microcontrollers Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics. “Its increased processing power, AI acceleration, large and extensible memory, rich analogue content, smart sensing capabilities, and intelligent power management functions support new applications such as virtual sensors. This better enables automakers with the tools to create safer, more efficient and more responsive driving experiences.”\n\nA defining feature of the Stellar P3E is its integrated ST Neural-ART Accelerator™ for real-time AI efficiency —making it the first MCU with an embedded neural network accelerator for the automotive industry. Powered by this dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) with an advanced data-flow architecture for AI workloads, and combined with its rich sensing capabilities, the P3E enables smart sensing that opens the door to new applications such as virtual sensors.\n\nThe P3E delivers inference processing at microsecond speeds, achieving up to 30x greater efficiency compared to traditional MCU core processors. This enables always-on, low-power artificial intelligence (AI) that can support real-time functions, including predictive maintenance and smart sensing, delivering significant benefits across a wide range of applications. For example, these capabilities can enhance charging speed and efficiency in electric vehicles and enable rapid deployment of new features, whether in the factory or in the field. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can introduce new functions and more intuitive behaviors through different AI models, reducing the need for additional sensors, modules, wiring, and integration effort.\n\n“Shifting neural processing from centralized hubs to the edge of the vehicle enables sub millisecond-level decision-making, which is essential for the next generation of in-vehicle intelligence. Integrating AI hardware acceleration at the MCU level allows OEMs to deliver advanced capabilities, such as predictive maintenance for vehicle performance and smart sensing with virtual sensor applications. This enables very low latency sensing, actuation control, and other sophisticated features, without the cost and thermal burden of a full-scale SoC,” said Greg Basich, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research.\n\nAs the automotive industry embraces the shift toward software-defined vehicles (SDVs), Stellar P3E’s integrated xMemory, ST’s proprietary non-volatile memory based on phase-change memory (PCM) , provides the essential scalability and flexibility needed. Offering twice the density of traditional embedded flash memory and qualified for automotive environments, this extensible memory solution enables dynamic expansion of software storage to accommodate new features and updates without requiring any hardware redesign.\n\nThe P3E is fully supported within the ST Edge AI Suite , a comprehensive edge-AI ecosystem that spans from dataset creation to on-device deployment for data scientists and embedded engineers. As part of this suite, NanoEdge AI Studio tool is now available for the entire Stellar MCU family. In addition, the Stellar P3E is already integrated into Stellar Studio , ST’s all-in-one development environment tailored for automotive engineers. Together they reinforce a robust hardware and software ecosystem designed to streamline the deployment of sophisticated edge AI solutions in demanding automotive environments.\n\nThe start of production of the Stellar P3E is planned in the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nKey technical highlights :\n\n500 MHz Arm® Cortex®-R52+ cores delivering the highest CoreMark score in its class - exceeding 8,000 points.\n\nSplit-lock architecture enabling designers to optimize the balance between functional safety and peak performance.\n\nOpen Arm architecture, leveraging a vast global developer community for accelerated innovation.\n\nRich I/O and analog capabilities support diverse functions, including advanced motor control for enhanced vehicle dynamics.\n\nAbout STMicroelectronics\n\nAt ST, we are 48,000 creators and makers of semiconductor technologies mastering the semiconductor supply chain with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. An integrated device manufacturer, we work with more than 200,000 customers and thousands of partners to design and build products, solutions, and ecosystems that address their challenges and opportunities, and the need to support a more sustainable world.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-revealing-analyst-questions-skyworks-053358424.html",
      "Content": "Skyworks Solutions' fourth quarter results were marked by a combination of broad market momentum and stable mobile performance. Management pointed to ongoing growth in edge IoT, automotive, and data center segments, which collectively contributed to outperformance relative to Wall Street’s revenue and profit expectations. CEO Philip Brace attributed the quarter's results to robust execution in flagship mobile programs and expanding design wins in Wi-Fi 7 and automotive connectivity, while highlighting that smartphone replacement cycles are beginning to shorten. Management maintained a focus on disciplined investment and customer engagement amid industry-wide component pricing conversations.\n\nIs now the time to buy SWKS? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\n\nRevenue: $1.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.00 billion (3.1% year-on-year decline, 3.4% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $1.54 vs analyst estimates of $1.40 (10.1% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $325 million vs analyst estimates of $277.5 million (31.4% margin, 17.1% beat)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $900 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $871.5 million\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.04 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.96\n\nOperating Margin: 10%, down from 16.9% in the same quarter last year\n\nInventory Days Outstanding: 115, up from 105 in the previous quarter\n\nMarket Capitalization: $9.26 billion\n\nWhile we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\n\nHarsh Kumar (Piper Sandler) asked about the specific technology and R&D benefits of the Qorvo deal. CEO Philip Brace highlighted complementary portfolios, particularly in RF technologies, and the potential to innovate across product categories.\n\nKarl Ackerman (BNP Paribas) questioned where broad market growth would be strongest and what would drive long-term expansion. Brace pointed to Wi-Fi adoption, automotive connectivity, and data center power/timing products as main growth areas.\n\nEdward Snyder (Charter Equity Research) probed on mobile content stability and mix impact. Brace explained that content gains could be moderated by model mix, making blended content per device flat, and noted ongoing strong demand.\n\nTimothy Arcuri (UBS) inquired about potential pricing pressure from the largest customer and repurchase activity. CFO Philip Carter said competitive pricing remains dynamic, but current demand is absorbing supply, and buybacks will be considered with financial prudence.\n\nPeter Peng (JPMorgan) asked about unit demand and seasonality in the mobile segment. Brace confirmed strong current demand and said seasonality remains normal, with no unusual patterns anticipated.\n\nIn the coming quarters, the StockStory team will be watching (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from Wi-Fi 7 and automotive connectivity, (2) execution on data center power and timing product launches, and (3) progress on integration planning and regulatory milestones for the Qorvo transaction. The company’s ability to manage mobile content stability and pricing dynamics will also be a key area of focus.\n\nSkyworks Solutions currently trades at $61.45, up from $55.93 just before the earnings. In the wake of this quarter, is it a buy or sell? See for yourself in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members) .\n\nThe market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\n\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Exlservice (+354% five-year return).

      "Content": "Semiconductors are the core infrastructure powering the Information Age. The way we live and work is also changing with AI, which is creating secular demand for more powerful chips. As a result, the industry has seen solid stock price performance over the last six months as its gain of 66% has outpaced the S&P 500’s 8.6% return.\n\nRegardless of these results, investors must exercise caution as the rapid pace of innovation can easily turn today’s winners into tomorrow’s losers. Keeping that in mind, here is one semiconductor stock boasting a durable advantage and two we’re steering clear of.\n\nMarket Cap: $57.61 billion\n\nSpun off from Dutch electronics giant Philips in 2006, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of chips used in autos, industrial manufacturing, mobile devices, and communications infrastructure.\n\nWhy Are We Wary of NXPI?\n\nCustomers postponed purchases of its products and services this cycle as its revenue declined by 3.9% annually over the last two years\n\nProjected sales growth of 10.6% for the next 12 months suggests sluggish demand\n\nNXP Semiconductors is trading at $228.80 per share, or 16.1x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why NXPI doesn’t pass our bar .\n\nMarket Cap: $3.82 billion\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Kulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC) is a provider of production equipment and tools used to assemble semiconductor devices\n\nWhy Is KLIC Risky?\n\nAnnual sales declines of 1.6% for the past five years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market during this cycle\n\nOperating margin declined by 40.3 percentage points over the last five years as its sales cratered\n\nPerformance over the past five years shows each sale was less profitable as its earnings per share dropped by 29.8% annually, worse than its revenue\n\nKulicke and Soffa’s stock price of $72.79 implies a valuation ratio of 24.2x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with KLIC, check out our full research report (it’s free) .\n\nMarket Cap: $96.96 billion\n\nFounded in 1970 by a Motorola employee, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) is a leading producer of hard disk drives, SSDs and flash memory.\n\nWhy Does WDC Stand Out?\n\nProjected revenue growth of 31.7% for the next 12 months is above its two-year trend, pointing to accelerating demand\n\nOperating margin expansion of 16.1 percentage points over the last five years shows the company optimized its expenses\n\nFree cash flow margin increased by 14.7 percentage points over the last five years, giving the company more capital to invest or return to shareholders\n\nAt $285.35 per share, Western Digital trades at 25.1x forward P/E. Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free .\n\nIf your portfolio success hinges on just 4 stocks, your wealth is built on fragile ground. You have a small window to secure high-quality assets before the market widens and these prices disappear.\n\nDon’t wait for the next volatility shock.

Davidson分析師Gil Luria出具報告指出，我們認為市場過度反應，股價已經跌過頭。近幾個月來，OpenAI的商業模式已有顯著進步，「OpenAI似乎已經修正策略失誤，並重新聚焦於核心的前沿模型（frontier models），也開始考慮安插廣告的「變現」模式，「我們認為重整後的OpenAI可望重返Google最大挑戰者的位置」。CNBC報導，OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）上周五告知員工和投資人，ChatGPT的月成長率已重返逾10%。他並透露本周將推出升級版的AI聊天機器人模型。\n\n●Alphabet漲0.45%，收在324.32美元。據外媒報導，Google母公司Alphabet周一成功發行公司債籌資200億美元，規模超出原訂的150億美元。Alphabet此次發債吸引超過1000億美元認購，成為史上企業債發行需求最強勁的交易之一，顯示對於科技巨頭舉債發展AI，市場目前仍然樂意買單。分析師表示，這可能帶動今年企業債發行規模創下歷史新高。\n\n●Waters Corp周一崩跌13.94%，收在328.14美元，在醫療保健成分股中跌幅最大。該實驗室設備製造商第一季獲利預測不如市場預期，此外，投資人也關注去年收購的Becton Dickinson表現疲弱。\n●Hims & Hers Health暴跌16%，為連跌第七天。諾和諾德（Novo Nordisk）以侵犯專利權為由向這家遠距醫療（telehealth）公司提起告訴。此前，在美國食藥管理局（FDA）強烈反對下，Hims & Hers Health在推出僅48小時後後又立即下架一款售價僅49美元的諾和諾德減肥藥Wegovy仿製藥。\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.

      "Content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus .\n\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Web Services appears to be tightening its grip on critical data-center infrastructure by deepening its relationship with STMicroelectronics NV ( NYSE:STM ), as the cloud unit looks to secure a broader range of semiconductor technologies for its hyperscale operations. Under the agreement disclosed on Monday, STMicro will supply AWS with chips supporting high-bandwidth connectivity and energy-efficient power management, components that are increasingly relevant as AI workloads place heavier demands on data-center performance and power efficiency. The structure of the deal suggests AWS is positioning itself not just as a customer, but as a long-term partner as global data-center build-outs accelerate.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nAlongside the commercial supply arrangement, AWS received warrants to acquire up to 24.8 million ordinary STMicro shares, with vesting linked to AWS's purchases of STMicro products over time. The warrants can be exercised over a seven-year period at an initial exercise price of $28.38, giving AWS the flexibility to build an equity position in stages. STMicro shares rose 6.5% at the market open to $26.51 following the announcement, while for AWS the move represents at least its second investment in a semiconductor company, reinforcing the view that cloud operators could increasingly blend procurement and capital allocation to secure strategic supply.\n\nThe backdrop to the agreement is a widening semiconductor opportunity driven by AI-related data-center investment, where demand is extending beyond advanced processors into analog chips used for power management, sensing, and cooling. STMicro, which supplies customers such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), recently forecast first-quarter revenue that came in above analysts' expectations, with consumer electronics demand showing signs of recovery late last year after a prolonged slump. At the same time, management has cautioned that the rebound remains uneven, with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery noting that the automotive market is not yet stable, suggesting that AI-driven infrastructure demand could be an important, though not uniform, support for the company's outlook.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arena-private-wealth-midwest-ria-201200277.html",
      "Content": "Midwest-based RIA steps into growth-stage capital leadership role typically held by coastal venture firms.\n\nCHICAGO , Feb. 9, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- ARENA Private Wealth, a Midwest-based registered investment advisor with offices in Chicago, Cleveland, and Columbus, today announced that it played the lead role in a $230 million Series B fundraising round for Positron AI, a growth-stage technology company building energy-efficient AI inference hardware. The round values Positron at over $1 billion, achieving unicorn status, and was announced at the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nThe Series B was led by ARENA Private Wealth alongside Jump Trading and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Arm Holdings, and Helena, as well as participation from existing investors. Capital raises of this size and stature are most often led by technology-focused venture capital firms based on the coasts, making ARENA's leadership role a notable departure from the traditional Series B playbook.\n\nRather than operating as a traditional venture capital firm, ARENA approaches growth-stage investing as an alternative capital partner. The firm positions itself as a bridge between private wealth and founders through an integrated platform spanning Private Wealth, Alternatives, and Capital Markets.\n\nFor ARENA's investors, this model provides access to differentiated direct investment opportunities that are typically available only through large venture funds or institutional vehicles. Through ARENA's relationships, diligence process, and ability to structure and lead transactions, investors can participate directly in opportunities like Positron, gaining exposure at a meaningful stage while remaining aligned with a disciplined, long-term approach to risk.\n\n\"Opportunities like this are rare, and that's exactly why they can be so meaningful for our investors,\" said Ari Schottenstein, Head of Alternatives at ARENA Private Wealth. \"We say no far more often than we say yes, and when we do step forward, it's because we've done the work to understand the risks and believe the opportunity justifies that responsibility. Positron stood out because the leadership, market position, and timing aligned in a way that allowed us to bring something truly differentiated to our clients.\"\n\nFor founders, ARENA offers capital without competing interests and a fundraising option that operates outside traditional venture networks. In addition to capital, founders gain access to a broader and less homogeneous network, a strategic perspective informed by multiple markets and asset classes, and a collaborative partner focused on execution, alignment, and long-term value creation.\n\n\"As a founder, you're used to thinking about venture firms and strategic investors as your primary options,\" said Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron AI. \"What stood out about working with ARENA was their ability to show up as a true capital partner, bringing collaborative strategy, access to an expansive network of relationships, and a new perspective that helped us think differently about how we scale.\"\n\n\"This investment reflects how growth-stage companies are opening the door to who they want at the table,\" said Schottenstein. \"Positron has shipping traction today and a credible roadmap ahead, and our role was to support that vision by showing up with broader investor support and alignment around long-term value creation.\"\n\nThe Positron transaction marks an inflection point in the technology capital landscape, driven by rising investor interest in alternative investments. ARENA's role illustrates how a modern private wealth firm can lead this next chapter as a relevant capital partner, stepping forward with conviction to source and shape opportunities, expanding the network of capital and ideas that support growth-stage companies.\n\nAbout ARENA Private Wealth\n\nARENA Private Wealth is a Midwest-based wealth management firm offering an integrated platform across Private Wealth, Alternatives, and Capital Markets. With offices in Chicago, Cleveland, and Columbus, ARENA connects clients to differentiated opportunities through deep relationships, disciplined diligence, and a coordinated approach to long-term portfolio strategy.

      "Content": "Applied Materials AMAT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 12.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, AMAT expects revenues to be $6.85 billion (+/- $500 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.89 billion, suggesting a decline of 3.87% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.\n\nApplied Materials projects non-GAAP earnings to be $2.18 (+/- $0.20). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.19 per share, indicating a decline of 7.98% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMAT has an impressive earnings surprise history. AMAT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.17%.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for AMAT this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($2.26 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.19 per share), is +3.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nAMAT’s wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is experiencing increased demand due to a rise in the usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC). In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million. Although AMAT has a lower market share in the NAND space, it is gaining prominence. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supporting AMAT’s top-line growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ leadership in GAA transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips, are likely to have driven AMAT’s semiconductor segment in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nAMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\n\nApplied Materials shares have gained 74.9% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has gained 19.4%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet us now look at the value Applied Materials offers to its investors at current levels. AMAT is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 8.46X compared with the industry’s 8.26X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApplied Materials operates in a highly competitive market space where it faces competition from players, including Lam Research LRCX in the semiconductor space, ASML Holding ASML in the photolithography and advanced manufacturing equipment segment. KLA Corporation KLAC is a dominant competitor in the wafer inspection space.\n\nFor instance, Lam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although developing solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holding develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions, such as Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nAMAT is gaining from continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and HPC. AMAT’s HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology technologies are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Considering these factors, we suggest investors buy this stock now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cirrus-logic-inc-crus-soars-141505325.html",
      "Content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $144.76 in the previous session. Cirrus Logic has gained 20.5% since the start of the year compared to the -0.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3.2% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 3, 2026, Cirrus Logic reported EPS of $2.97 versus consensus estimate of $2.42.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Cirrus Logic is expected to post earnings of $8.51 per share on $1.94 in revenues. This represents a 12.86% change in EPS on a 2.35% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.77 per share on $2.03 in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.03% and 4.48%, respectively.\n\nThough Cirrus Logic has recently hit a 52-week high, what is next for Cirrus Logic? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). The individual style scores for Value, Growth, Momentum and the combined VGM Score run from A through F. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nCirrus Logic has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 37.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.4X versus its peer group's average of 23.4X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cirrus Logic fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Cirrus Logic shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nShares of CRUS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) . AMAT has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of D, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Applied Materials, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 2.84%, and for the current fiscal year, AMAT is expected to post earnings of $9.62 per share on revenue of $29.17 billion.\n\nShares of Applied Materials, Inc. have gained 7.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 33.53X and a P/CF of 31.95X.\n\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CRUS and AMAT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Stock futures are slightly lower this morning after a Friday rally that pushed the Dow above 50,000 for the first time; investors are preparing for a big week of earnings reports and important economic data releases; Novo Nordisk shares are rising after Hims & Hers Health said over the weekend it would pull its compounded semaglutide pill, sending shares of the telehealth company sharply lower; Kroger shares are rising on news the supermarket chain has hired a new CEO; and STMicroelectronics shares are jumping after the European chipmaker announced a deal to supply Amazon. Here's what you need to know today.\n\nStock futures are down slightly Monday as investors look ahead to a busy week of earnings and economic reports. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down 0.1% recently, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The major indexes soared on Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading, with the Dow gaining 1,200 points to close above 50,000 for the first time. Bitcoin was at $69,000 this morning, down from a Sunday high of around $72,000 but well up from last week's low of around $60,000 , the cryptocurrency's lowest level since late 2024. Gold futures were recently up 1% at $5,030 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $63.75 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.24%, up from 4.20% at Friday's close.\n\nInvestors are preparing for a busy week of earnings reports and the release of economic data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The earnings calendar includes reports from iconic American brands such as McDonald's ( MCD ), The Coca-Cola Company ( KO ) and Ford Motor ( F ), as well as releases from CVS Health ( CVS ), AstraZeneca ( AZN ), T-Mobile ( TMUS ), Robinhood ( HOOD ), Coinbase ( COIN ), Spotify Technology ( SPOT ) and Airbnb ( ABNB ), among others. The January jobs report is scheduled for release on Wednesday morning, while the Consumer Price Index is due on Friday. The Fed, which has a dual mandate to maintain price stability while promoting maximum employment, will be watching the data closely.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk ( NVO ) are rising while Hims & Hers Health ( HIMS ) shares are tumbling following the latest developments in the weight-loss drug wars. Hims & Hers said over the weekend that it will stop offering its compounded semaglutide pill just days after launching the product . The pill was marketed as having the same active ingredient as Novo's Wegovy pill that received FDA approval in December . The FDA said on Friday that it planned to \"take decisive steps to restrict\" the use of GLP-1 active ingredients in compounded versions of the popular weight loss medications, citing Hims & Hers by name in the statement. Novo Nordisk on Monday announced a lawsuit against Hims & Hers, saying it is asking a court to \"permanently ban Hims from selling unapproved, compounded drugs that infringe our patents, and is seeking to recover damages.\" Shares of Novo Nordisk were up more than 5% in recent premarket trading, while Hims shares sank 20% to their lowest levels since September 2024.\n\nKroger ( KR ) stock is gaining ground this morning following news the grocery giant has hired former Walmart ( WMT ) executive Greg Foran to be its CEO. The Wall Street Journal had reported on Sunday that the decision had been made and that an announcement was imminent. Foran served as head of Walmart's U.S. business from 2014 to 2019, before spending the next several years leading Air New Zealand as CEO. Kroger has been looking for a new CEO for nearly a year, since previous CEO Rodney McMullen was dismissed in March 2025 over an undisclosed ethics violation. Foran was identified as a potential candidate by Wall Street analysts in the weeks after McMullen was fired, as they said a former Walmart executive could help Kroger compete with the nation's largest retailer. Kroger's move comes at a busy time for executive changes in retail, as Walmart itself and rival Target ( TGT ) each recently welcomed new CEOs . Kroger shares were up 7% recently.\n\nShares of STMicroelectronics ( STM ) are surging after the European chipmaker announced a new deal with Amazon ( AMZN ). The company said Monday that it has agreed to a \"multi-year, multi-billion\" dollar deal to supply Amazon Web Services with a range of semiconductors. The chipmaker also said it has issued warrants that would allow Amazon to acquire up to 24.8 million shares in the company over the next several years as part of the deal. Amazon and other tech giants have laid out plans in recent weeks to substantially increase their spending on artificial intelligence projects this year, including building data centers and buying the equipment to run them. Amazon said last week its capital expenditures could reach up to $200 billion this year. U.S.-traded shares of STMicroelectronics were up 7% recently. Amazon stock was little changed after tumbling Friday following the company's announcement of the big spending plans and a weaker-than-expected earnings report.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia",

      "Content": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at NXP Semiconductors ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NXP Semiconductors:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.15 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2025) .\n\nThus, NXP Semiconductors has an ROCE of 15%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.1% generated by the Semiconductor industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NXP Semiconductors\n\nIn the above chart we have measured NXP Semiconductors' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for NXP Semiconductors .\n\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from NXP Semiconductors. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 15%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 27%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that NXP Semiconductors can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 26% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\n\nLike most companies, NXP Semiconductors does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Wall Street offered a muted performance last week. The S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.8%. The key event of the week was the tech stock rout. Wall Street has been skeptical about software stocks in recent times, but a phase of outright panic hit last week.\n\nTraders dumped shares across the sector as fears mount that artificial intelligence (AI) could fundamentally disrupt software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models.The anxiety intensified on Feb. 3, 2026, after AI startup Anthropic unveiled a productivity tool aimed at in-house lawyers. The announcement triggered a sharp selloff in legal software and publishing stocks, per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\n\nMeanwhile, six out of all Mag 7 members have reported their Q4 results, with just NVDA remaining. Alphabet and Amazon reported last week.Amazon missed EPS estimates, but the business is otherwise in great shape.\n\nAmazon plans to spend $200 billion in capital expenditures in 2026, up from $132 billion in 2025 and $83 billion in 2024. While Amazon remains the cloud leader, the Alphabet report showed accelerating momentum at the search giant&rsquo;s Google Cloud business (read: Amazon Drops on Mixed Q4 & Capex Outlook: Buy the Dip With ETFs?).\n\nIn a nutshell, combining the actual results for the six Magnificent 7 members that have reported already along with estimates for Nvidia, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up 24.2% from the same period last year on 18.9% higher revenues, which would follow the group&rsquo;s 28.3% earnings growth on 18.1% revenue growth in 2025 Q3, per Zacks Earnings Trends.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight the winning leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nTradr 2X Long LITE Daily ETF LITX &ndash; Up 79.5%\n\nLumentum Holdings Inc LITE stock surged 36.3% last week on the earnings strength. Lumentum's Q1 2026 revenues rose 58% year over year to $533.8 million, topping estimates by 1.43%. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.10 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%, driven by AI and cloud strength. The company offered an upbeat outlook, too.\n\nTradr 2X Long ENPH Daily ETF ENPX &ndash; Up 67.7%\n\nEnphase Energy ENPH shares rose 35.8% last week. Enphase last weekreported fourth-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of 71 cents per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents by 31.5%.Enphase Energy&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues of $343.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $335 million by 2.6%.\n\nTradr 2X Short IREN Daily ETF IREZ &ndash; Up 37.1%\n\nIREN Ltd IREN lost about 20.1% last week, lending a surge to the double-leveraged IREN ETF. Last week, IREN came with a Q2 FY26 loss of 44 cents per share as revenues slid 23.1% sequentially and missed estimates. Total revenues fell 23.1% sequentially to $184.7 million, missing the consensus estimate by 16.49%. Bitcoin revenues fell 28.2% quarter on quarter. However, AI cloud services revenues jumped 137% from the prior quarter.\n\nT-Rex 2X Long ARM Daily Target ETF ARMU) &ndash; Up 35.0%\n\nArm Holdings ARM gained about 18% last week. The stock gained on a strong fiscal third-quarter 2026 earnings report released on Feb. 4, 2026.

      "Content": "When investors look at investing in computer chips to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they are likely to start with a company like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . That makes sense, given that it makes the most popular chips for handling AI workloads. However, there's another chip stock that could also turn out to be a huge AI winner: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) .\n\nNvidia makes high-powered parallel processing chips that act as the primary brains that undergird AI software. Texas Instruments makes analog chips, the boring ones that convert physical events into digital signals. When you push a button on a digital device, it is likely being controlled by an analog chip. Texas Instruments' chips are simple, relatively low cost, and can be found in tech products virtually everywhere.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nIn the artificial intelligence hardware world, Texas Instruments' chips provide power management. That's a vital function within the data centers that house AI. Given the expectation that the AI infrastructure buildout is only just beginning, Texas Instruments could have years of growth ahead of it in this end market.\n\nOver the last few years, the analog chip sector has been in a rut. However, Texas Instruments has been investing in new chip production capacity. Just recently, it agreed to buy competitor Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) . In other words, Texas Instruments is preparing for growth.\n\nIt is also shifting the way it reports its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company broke out its data center business as a separate end market. The segment accounted for around 9% of the top line. However, it grew 64% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's probably not a number to bake into your growth expectations, given that the AI opportunity is brand new. Still, revenue rose by a mid-single-digit percentage from the third quarter. If this is just the beginning of the AI buildout, this segment could help supercharge an upturn in the typically cyclical analog chip sector and support growth for years to come.\n\nThere are other analog chipmakers , and there are chipmakers that make more exciting chips than Texas Instruments. However, for most investors, opening a position in this industry-leading company will probably set you up for long-term success. And given the strength of the business and the company's growth efforts, the AI buildout could easily turn Texas Instruments into a top-performing chipmaker by 2027, if not sooner.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Texas Instruments wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Headquartered in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) designs and delivers advanced chips across processors, connectivity, analog, security, and sensor technologies. With a market cap of roughly $56.5 billion, the company forms the invisible backbone of vehicles, factories, Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, mobile devices, and modern communications infrastructure.\n\nWhile the business footprint looks expansive, stock performance has introduced a more restrained narrative. Over the past 52 weeks, NXPI stock gained 3.5%, trailing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) 14% gain. Year-to-date (YTD), however, the stock rose 3.3%, edging past the broader index’s modest 1.3% increase.\n\nInflation, Earnings and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\n\nWhy Alphabet's Free Cash Flow Could Survive, Despite the Market's Fears - How to Play GOOGL\n\nShould You Buy AT&T Stock After Its Amazon Leo Win?\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nPlacing that performance within the sector sharpens perspective. The State Street SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) surged 45.3% over the same 52-week period and added 11.6% YTD.\n\nOn Feb. 2, NXP Semiconductors reported its Q4 2025 earnings results, immediately lifting the stock 2.2%. Revenue grew 7.2% year over year to $3.34 billion, topping the $3.3 billion analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS rose 5.3% to $3.35, clearing Wall Street’s $3.30 forecast with room to spare.\n\nDespite beating headline estimates, NXPI stock slid 4.5% in the next trading session as investors focused on elevated inventories and emerging signs of long-term margin pressure. However, management countered with a strategic reset anchored in “physical artificial intelligence (AI),” emphasizing accelerating demand for industrial products with built-in intelligence at the edge.\n\nLeadership also cited stronger regional manufacturing amid geopolitical pressure. As automakers stop trimming orders and inventory correction fades, management now sees visibility into growth from next-generation, AI-enabled products.\n\nThe outlook carries into the forward estimates. For fiscal year 2026, ending in December, analysts project diluted EPS of $12.37, implying 21.3% year-over-year growth. Importantly, NXP Semiconductors has beaten EPS expectations in three of the past four quarters, missing only once.\n\nWall Street sentiment remains firmly supportive, assigning NXPI stock an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Out of 30 analysts, 22 rate NXPI stock a “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” and six suggest “Hold.”\n\nImportantly, the outlook remains unchanged from three months ago, when 22 analysts also labeled the stock a “Strong Buy.”\n\nWhile NXPI stock has lagged peers from a growth standpoint, recent demand commentary appears stronger than that of many competitors. Reinforcing this view, TD Cowen raised its price target to $285 from $260 on Jan. 16 while maintaining a “Buy” rating on the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, analyst targets paint a clearer picture of what the market believes the stock can deliver. NXPI’s average price target of $259.67 implies potential upside of 15.8%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $324.40 suggests a gain of 44.6% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "全球股市表現亮眼，推升存股熱潮，除了下跌時單筆加碼，據投信投顧公會統計，投資人定期定額趨勢也持續成長，在元大台灣 50(0050-TW) 等主被動產品帶動下，元大投信旗下基金單月定期定額扣款金額突破百億，再創全新里程碑。\n據投信投顧公會 2025 年 12 月底資料，投資人數大幅成長的元大台灣 50 ETF，定期定額金額也來到 70.8 億元新高，與 2024 年 12 月底相比大增 48.2 億元、人數同期成長 43.3 萬，平均每人單月扣款接近萬元，帶動元大投信旗下基金單月定期定額來到 105 億元，領先市場。\n\n元大投信指出，0050 為台灣首檔市值型 ETF，成立以來至 2026 年 1 月含息報酬率為 1511%，以每年 250 交易日換算年化報酬率約為 13.3%。市值型設計將始終跟隨市場主流趨勢，成分股市值變化會直接反映於 0050 股價表現，高效率參與台股行情，2025 年優化費用率、股價分割後，帶動市值型投資策略認同度提升。\n\n在 0050 之外，元大投信定期定額前五名投資標的還包括元大高股息 (0056-TW)、元大台灣高息低波 (00713-TW)、元大 S&P500(00646-TW)、元大臺灣 ESG 永續 (00850-TW)，均為證交所定期定額戶數排行榜前 20 名。\n元大 S&P500 所追蹤的標普 500 指數，為美國最具代表性大盤指數，多次獲股神巴菲特推薦一般投資人應選擇標普 500 指數基金作為核心配置。據 S&P Global 統計，截至 2025 年 6 月 30 日的 20 年期間，標普 500 指數長期報酬優於 91% 美國大型股票基金，且時間愈長，愈能突顯被動投資優勢。對於台灣投資人而言，可透過 00646 建立美股資產，與 0050 進行搭配。\n元大投信表示，定期定額及早開始比擇時進場重要，面對股市長期向上趨勢，雖然定期定額成果短期內較易受市場波動影響，但長期會因為投入資金筆數增加而平均投資成本，進而反映長期投資優勢。\n元大投信並提醒，0050 為純粹的市值型 ETF，集中反映主要上市權值股表現，持續建議投資人透過定期定額分散單筆投入風險，投資前應有完整的資金投入規劃，以避免過度承受單一年度大跌風險。00646 為新台幣計價之美股 ETF，實際投資成果會受到基金成本與匯率變化影響，將與指數表現有所差異。\n※免責聲明：文中所提的個股、基金、期貨商品內容僅供參考，並非投資建議，投資人應獨立判斷，審慎評估風險，自負盈虧。\n更多鉅亨報導\n&bull; 〈台股盤後〉暴力反彈621點登第10大漲點 記億體大復活群飆漲停\n&bull; 日股強勢回歸！「早苗經濟學」點火 法人：善用匯率避險型ETF卡位先機\n\n熱門新聞\n1\n\n美規車零關稅》最多降1成！車廠降價有譜 雙B開第一槍 2\n\n13.5億威力彩「2得主」買法一模一樣！ 只花100元就翻身 3\n\n「新版新台幣」可能有石虎！票選結果曝光 台積電僅排第七 4\n\n陸客不去日本！外媒爆25萬大軍「改衝這國」 刷爆103億不手軟 5\n\n郭台銘大紅包發威！央行新台幣發行額首破4.2兆  年增率飆3年最高\n\n台股資料來源 臺灣證券交易所 、 臺灣期貨交易所 及 財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心 ，國際股市資料來源請參考 Yahoo Finance 。台股行情、個股基本資料及財務資訊為精誠資訊提供。使用Yahoo股市服務前，請您詳閱相關 使用規範與聲明 。\n\n服務條款 隱私權 您的隱私權選擇 加州隱私權通知 © 2026 Yahoo.
