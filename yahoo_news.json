Nolan\nExecutive Vice President & CFO — John M. Moreira\nVice President, Investor Relations — Rima Hyder\nFull Conference Call Transcript Joseph R. Nolan: Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Nolan\nExecutive Vice President & CFO — John M. Moreira\nVice President, Investor Relations — Rima Hyder\nFull Conference Call Transcript Joseph R. Nolan: Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Nolan\nExecutive Vice President & CFO — John M. Moreira\nVice President, Investor Relations — Rima Hyder\nFull Conference Call Transcript Joseph R. Nolan: Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

      "Content": "US Congress impasse over immigration set to trigger partial shutdown\n\nRobin LEGRAND\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:32 AM PST 3 min read\n\nA prolonged impasse between US lawmakers over immigration enforcement threatens to ensnare the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday, following two fatal shootings in Minneapolis.\n\"For weeks, we've been pushing commonsense reforms,\" Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Republican-controlled Senate, said ahead of a partial shutdown that would go into effect after midnight on Friday night.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition telling Fox News that \"Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons.\"\nThe Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented in the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) -- the powerful agency working to carry out President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown -- conducts its operations.\nIn particular, they demand curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing facemasks during operations, and the use of a judicial warrant to enter private property.\nDemocrats' opposition to ICE and its heavy-handed tactics swelled after the January deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two US citizens shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis as they protested anti-immigration operations.\n\n\"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" Schumer said.\n- ICE 'out of control' -\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed similar concerns Thursday, warning that ICE was \"completely and totally out of control.\"\n\"Taxpayer dollars should be used to make life more affordable for the American people, not brutalize or kill them,\" he said, stressing that violence was occurring \"whenever these masked and untrained ICE agents show up.\"\nEven if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several opposition Democrats would need to get on board.\nIn response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate.\n\n\"The White House has been very much engaged with Democrats in serious discussions and negotiations over immigration enforcement policy,\" Leavitt said.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune called it \"an extremely serious offer\" and said Democrats are \"never going to get their full wish list.\"\nBut \"half-measures will not cut it,\" said Senate Democrat Patty Murray, adding that her party's demands were reasonable and necessary.\n\nStory Continues\n- Airports impacted? -\nIf no deal is reached, thousands of civil servants could be furloughed, while thousands more will be required to work without pay -- until a budget deal is finalized.\nBut ICE would be able to maintain operations because of funds already approved by Congress last year.\nThe primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.\nThe Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.\nThe shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November.\nrle/md/bgs\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "US Congress impasse over immigration set to trigger partial shutdown\n\nRobin LEGRAND\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:32 AM PST 3 min read\n\nA prolonged impasse between US lawmakers over immigration enforcement threatens to ensnare the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday, following two fatal shootings in Minneapolis.\n\"For weeks, we've been pushing commonsense reforms,\" Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Republican-controlled Senate, said ahead of a partial shutdown that would go into effect after midnight on Friday night.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition telling Fox News that \"Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons.\"\nThe Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented in the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) -- the powerful agency working to carry out President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown -- conducts its operations.\nIn particular, they demand curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing facemasks during operations, and the use of a judicial warrant to enter private property.\nDemocrats' opposition to ICE and its heavy-handed tactics swelled after the January deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two US citizens shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis as they protested anti-immigration operations.\n\n\"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" Schumer said.\n- ICE 'out of control' -\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed similar concerns Thursday, warning that ICE was \"completely and totally out of control.\"\n\"Taxpayer dollars should be used to make life more affordable for the American people, not brutalize or kill them,\" he said, stressing that violence was occurring \"whenever these masked and untrained ICE agents show up.\"\nEven if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several opposition Democrats would need to get on board.\nIn response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate.\n\n\"The White House has been very much engaged with Democrats in serious discussions and negotiations over immigration enforcement policy,\" Leavitt said.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune called it \"an extremely serious offer\" and said Democrats are \"never going to get their full wish list.\"\nBut \"half-measures will not cut it,\" said Senate Democrat Patty Murray, adding that her party's demands were reasonable and necessary.\n\nStory Continues\n- Airports impacted? -\nIf no deal is reached, thousands of civil servants could be furloughed, while thousands more will be required to work without pay -- until a budget deal is finalized.\nBut ICE would be able to maintain operations because of funds already approved by Congress last year.\nThe primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.\nThe Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.\nThe shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November.\nrle/md/bgs\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate\n\nRob Carpenter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:31 AM PST 12 min read\n\nThere’s an old saying in the “fake rich” world: you can rent the Bentley, rent the mansion, shoot the video, post the lifestyle, and for a little while, you can make people believe you’ve arrived. But there’s one thing most people can’t fake. A jet. It’s too expensive, too scrutinized, and too many people have to sign off before you get the keys.\n\nFor decades, insurance was trucking’s jet.\nYou could get a USDOT number for free. You could file a BOC-3 for a small amount. You could lease a truck for a thousand bucks a week and a trailer for less. You could fake a lot of things on the way in. But you could not fake your way past an underwriter. That was the one door in this industry that actually required you to prove something before it opened.\nWhen I started my own authority, I got put through the absolute ringer. Loss runs. MVRs. Operations questions. Safety management controls. Dispatch practices. Maintenance programs. Drug and alcohol testing. Driver qualification files. Someone actually wanted to know whether I had the business maturity and the risk controls to be trusted with 80,000 pounds next to families on I-95.\n\nThat gate has eroded. I think it’s time we talk about how to put it back.\nWhat The Front Door Used To Look Like Traditional insurance underwriting focused on screening risk. Before you could bind coverage and activate your authority, underwriters examined your operation. They reviewed your driver qualification process, MVR standards, drug and alcohol compliance, hours-of-service oversight, maintenance discipline, accident register, claims handling, organizational structure, and supervisory controls. That was the baseline.\nAt renewal, the process went even deeper. Agents and brokers assembled a full marketing package. They told your story. This is who they are. This is how they operate. This is how they manage risk. Here are the improvements they’ve made. They sold you to underwriters the way you’d sell a prospect to a captive group. That process enforced accountability, rewarded improvement, and created a natural barrier to entry that kept out those with no business operating 80,000-pound equipment on public highways.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it required the risk to prove itself before it received cheap access to the system.\nWhat The Front Door Looks Like Now Today, a growing slice of the market runs on self-attestation and instant-issue workflows. Especially the nefarious and poor performers. A new entrant goes online, self-declares a handful of details, who they are, what they have, how they operate, where they’re located, pays a premium, and walks away with a policy. No underwriter conversation. No document review. No verification of anything they just told you.\n\nStory Continues\nThat policy, paired with a $300 authority filing fee, a free USDOT number, and a $25 BOC-3, is enough to put a truck on the highway. The industry has moved toward connected and telematics-driven programs that can be activated quickly for new policyholders.\nI’m not anti-tech. I work with captives and insurers constantly. Innovation in underwriting is necessary and overdue. But when speed replaces verification at the entry point, we’re moving the risk test from the underwriting desk to the highway.\n\nThe public is funding that experiment.\nTiming Mismatch FMCSA’s New Entrant Safety Assurance Program was an important step forward. New carriers are supposed to receive a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation and are considered new entrants for 18 months. That program is designed to verify whether a carrier has the basic safety management controls in place to operate.\nBut the timing is the problem. Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate\n\nRob Carpenter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:31 AM PST 12 min read\n\nThere’s an old saying in the “fake rich” world: you can rent the Bentley, rent the mansion, shoot the video, post the lifestyle, and for a little while, you can make people believe you’ve arrived. But there’s one thing most people can’t fake. A jet. It’s too expensive, too scrutinized, and too many people have to sign off before you get the keys.\n\nFor decades, insurance was trucking’s jet.\nYou could get a USDOT number for free. You could file a BOC-3 for a small amount. You could lease a truck for a thousand bucks a week and a trailer for less. You could fake a lot of things on the way in. But you could not fake your way past an underwriter. That was the one door in this industry that actually required you to prove something before it opened.\nWhen I started my own authority, I got put through the absolute ringer. Loss runs. MVRs. Operations questions. Safety management controls. Dispatch practices. Maintenance programs. Drug and alcohol testing. Driver qualification files. Someone actually wanted to know whether I had the business maturity and the risk controls to be trusted with 80,000 pounds next to families on I-95.\n\nThat gate has eroded. I think it’s time we talk about how to put it back.\nWhat The Front Door Used To Look Like Traditional insurance underwriting focused on screening risk. Before you could bind coverage and activate your authority, underwriters examined your operation. They reviewed your driver qualification process, MVR standards, drug and alcohol compliance, hours-of-service oversight, maintenance discipline, accident register, claims handling, organizational structure, and supervisory controls. That was the baseline.\nAt renewal, the process went even deeper. Agents and brokers assembled a full marketing package. They told your story. This is who they are. This is how they operate. This is how they manage risk. Here are the improvements they’ve made. They sold you to underwriters the way you’d sell a prospect to a captive group. That process enforced accountability, rewarded improvement, and created a natural barrier to entry that kept out those with no business operating 80,000-pound equipment on public highways.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it required the risk to prove itself before it received cheap access to the system.\nWhat The Front Door Looks Like Now Today, a growing slice of the market runs on self-attestation and instant-issue workflows. Especially the nefarious and poor performers. A new entrant goes online, self-declares a handful of details, who they are, what they have, how they operate, where they’re located, pays a premium, and walks away with a policy. No underwriter conversation. No document review. No verification of anything they just told you.\n\nStory Continues\nThat policy, paired with a $300 authority filing fee, a free USDOT number, and a $25 BOC-3, is enough to put a truck on the highway. The industry has moved toward connected and telematics-driven programs that can be activated quickly for new policyholders.\nI’m not anti-tech. I work with captives and insurers constantly. Innovation in underwriting is necessary and overdue. But when speed replaces verification at the entry point, we’re moving the risk test from the underwriting desk to the highway.\n\nThe public is funding that experiment.\nTiming Mismatch FMCSA’s New Entrant Safety Assurance Program was an important step forward. New carriers are supposed to receive a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation and are considered new entrants for 18 months. That program is designed to verify whether a carrier has the basic safety management controls in place to operate.\nBut the timing is the problem. Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate\n\nRob Carpenter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:31 AM PST 12 min read\n\nThere’s an old saying in the “fake rich” world: you can rent the Bentley, rent the mansion, shoot the video, post the lifestyle, and for a little while, you can make people believe you’ve arrived. But there’s one thing most people can’t fake. A jet. It’s too expensive, too scrutinized, and too many people have to sign off before you get the keys.\n\nFor decades, insurance was trucking’s jet.\nYou could get a USDOT number for free. You could file a BOC-3 for a small amount. You could lease a truck for a thousand bucks a week and a trailer for less. You could fake a lot of things on the way in. But you could not fake your way past an underwriter. That was the one door in this industry that actually required you to prove something before it opened.\nWhen I started my own authority, I got put through the absolute ringer. Loss runs. MVRs. Operations questions. Safety management controls. Dispatch practices. Maintenance programs. Drug and alcohol testing. Driver qualification files. Someone actually wanted to know whether I had the business maturity and the risk controls to be trusted with 80,000 pounds next to families on I-95.\n\nThat gate has eroded. I think it’s time we talk about how to put it back.\nWhat The Front Door Used To Look Like Traditional insurance underwriting focused on screening risk. Before you could bind coverage and activate your authority, underwriters examined your operation. They reviewed your driver qualification process, MVR standards, drug and alcohol compliance, hours-of-service oversight, maintenance discipline, accident register, claims handling, organizational structure, and supervisory controls. That was the baseline.\nAt renewal, the process went even deeper. Agents and brokers assembled a full marketing package. They told your story. This is who they are. This is how they operate. This is how they manage risk. Here are the improvements they’ve made. They sold you to underwriters the way you’d sell a prospect to a captive group. That process enforced accountability, rewarded improvement, and created a natural barrier to entry that kept out those with no business operating 80,000-pound equipment on public highways.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it required the risk to prove itself before it received cheap access to the system.\nWhat The Front Door Looks Like Now Today, a growing slice of the market runs on self-attestation and instant-issue workflows. Especially the nefarious and poor performers. A new entrant goes online, self-declares a handful of details, who they are, what they have, how they operate, where they’re located, pays a premium, and walks away with a policy. No underwriter conversation. No document review. No verification of anything they just told you.\n\nStory Continues\nThat policy, paired with a $300 authority filing fee, a free USDOT number, and a $25 BOC-3, is enough to put a truck on the highway. The industry has moved toward connected and telematics-driven programs that can be activated quickly for new policyholders.\nI’m not anti-tech. I work with captives and insurers constantly. Innovation in underwriting is necessary and overdue. But when speed replaces verification at the entry point, we’re moving the risk test from the underwriting desk to the highway.\n\nThe public is funding that experiment.\nTiming Mismatch FMCSA’s New Entrant Safety Assurance Program was an important step forward. New carriers are supposed to receive a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation and are considered new entrants for 18 months.

You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

As you know, you know, we have the S&P 500 pegged at at 7600 by the end of the year. That that has not changed. But one of the risks that we highlighted in our 2026 outlook was what we termed the dark side of AI. Everybody want to talk, wants to talk about just the the the benefits and how it's going to be a change for good and that we absolutely buy into that. But you have to look at the other side. and we really see that dark side playing out in in in two ways. One,\n00:59 Tim\nwhat is the impact going to look like on the labor market? How big of a spike in unemployment are we actually going to see with layoffs that are triggered by AI. Right now those have been contained. The mass layoffs that we've seen recently, only about 15% of those have been related to AI.\n01:21 Tim\nThe the other piece of this is what other industries are they going to disrupt margins and even the entire industry altogether. And I think that's what you're seeing in the software stock space right now when we have a category that just not too long ago, Brian, these stocks were trading at about a 35X multiple. Now they're down below 20. You're down 20% plus this year. That's a significant sell-off. That's the dark side of AI. And we need to pay attention to that because I I do think there's going to be other industries that are disrupted and this is certainly a threat.\n02:05 Tim\nUh and even if it doesn't isn't a threat that plays out this year, it's something investors need to prepare for and watch out for volatility in their portfolios because it's going to scare investors. It's going to scare investors, so we need to be prepared for that. It's not just going to be up and to the right, uh, like like uh, some people hope.\n02:26 Brian\nTim, are we in a dark period yet for software stocks despite them falling uh aggressively or is that just I enter a room and the lights have been dimmed a little bit and we're about ready to get full on dark?\n02:40 Tim\nI don't I I I I would agree with you, Brian. I don't necessarily think the bottom is in here. I I do think we could fall further and and that's just you look at where margins are. I mean, margins are through the roof in this category of stocks. Those haven't come down yet. Um and valuations still are, you know, you know, pretty pretty elevated. So, they've come down. I think it's a better entry point, but but I I would be in your camp that I wouldn't call a bottom in this uh this category quite yet.\n03:10 Brian\nAnj, weigh in.\n03:13 Anj\nYeah, look, um, like what Tim is saying, I we may not have not see a bottom because investors are taking note of what's happening with the cost of coding, which is going down, uh with the disruption concerns. and it's not just in software, it's now in transportation and logistics, it's in wealth management. I mean, what area is not going to be disrupted by AI? And so I think that this is what the market is starting to sniff out. Oh, you mean that there's now going to be a disruption in these business models?\n03:55 Anj\nBecause you can have a startup that comes up and says, look, well, I can do this for you at a 10th of the cost of what you are getting from one of these bigger companies. So, this is um, sort of disruption in real time that you're seeing and with this uh with this what we saw yesterday with the pullback, although you don't want to call it a pullback. um but not.\n04:22 Brian\nAnj, don't tell me. Anj, I'm cutting you off right there. Don't even tell me. Don't tell me there's a pullback. Come on.\n04:26 Anj\nThe crash, the crash.\n04:29 Brian\nThere we go Anj, thank you.\n04:30 Anj\nLook, as as you saw tech that was going down yesterday and these in logistics and transportation companies that were down double digits, etc. you were looking at Walmart that was that just closed at an all-time high yesterday. So, certainly investors are going fully defensive here as they see what's happening. And by the way, there was this uh this uh tweet that was going out, this uh Substack this week also that was talking about the impact of AI. All of this is feeding into what is this going to do to these traditional companies, these big these tech companies that have high margins?

But you have to look at the other side. and we really see that dark side playing out in in in two ways. One,\n00:59 Tim\nwhat is the impact going to look like on the labor market? How big of a spike in unemployment are we actually going to see with layoffs that are triggered by AI. Right now those have been contained. The mass layoffs that we've seen recently, only about 15% of those have been related to AI.\n01:21 Tim\nThe the other piece of this is what other industries are they going to disrupt margins and even the entire industry altogether. And I think that's what you're seeing in the software stock space right now when we have a category that just not too long ago, Brian, these stocks were trading at about a 35X multiple. Now they're down below 20. You're down 20% plus this year. That's a significant sell-off. That's the dark side of AI. And we need to pay attention to that because I I do think there's going to be other industries that are disrupted and this is certainly a threat.\n02:05 Tim\nUh and even if it doesn't isn't a threat that plays out this year, it's something investors need to prepare for and watch out for volatility in their portfolios because it's going to scare investors. It's going to scare investors, so we need to be prepared for that. It's not just going to be up and to the right, uh, like like uh, some people hope.\n02:26 Brian\nTim, are we in a dark period yet for software stocks despite them falling uh aggressively or is that just I enter a room and the lights have been dimmed a little bit and we're about ready to get full on dark?\n02:40 Tim\nI don't I I I I would agree with you, Brian. I don't necessarily think the bottom is in here. I I do think we could fall further and and that's just you look at where margins are. I mean, margins are through the roof in this category of stocks. Those haven't come down yet. Um and valuations still are, you know, you know, pretty pretty elevated. So, they've come down. I think it's a better entry point, but but I I would be in your camp that I wouldn't call a bottom in this uh this category quite yet.\n03:10 Brian\nAnj, weigh in.\n03:13 Anj\nYeah, look, um, like what Tim is saying, I we may not have not see a bottom because investors are taking note of what's happening with the cost of coding, which is going down, uh with the disruption concerns. and it's not just in software, it's now in transportation and logistics, it's in wealth management. I mean, what area is not going to be disrupted by AI? And so I think that this is what the market is starting to sniff out. Oh, you mean that there's now going to be a disruption in these business models?\n03:55 Anj\nBecause you can have a startup that comes up and says, look, well, I can do this for you at a 10th of the cost of what you are getting from one of these bigger companies. So, this is um, sort of disruption in real time that you're seeing and with this uh with this what we saw yesterday with the pullback, although you don't want to call it a pullback. um but not.\n04:22 Brian\nAnj, don't tell me. Anj, I'm cutting you off right there. Don't even tell me. Don't tell me there's a pullback. Come on.\n04:26 Anj\nThe crash, the crash.\n04:29 Brian\nThere we go Anj, thank you.\n04:30 Anj\nLook, as as you saw tech that was going down yesterday and these in logistics and transportation companies that were down double digits, etc. you were looking at Walmart that was that just closed at an all-time high yesterday. So, certainly investors are going fully defensive here as they see what's happening. And by the way, there was this uh this uh tweet that was going out, this uh Substack this week also that was talking about the impact of AI. All of this is feeding into what is this going to do to these traditional companies, these big these tech companies that have high margins? What is this going to do to their business models?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The city where free buses changed everything\n\nPeter Yeung for Reasons to be Cheerful\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:30 AM PST 9 min read\n\nThe city where free buses changed everything The open-air central bus station in Dunkirk, France, feels like a Formula 1 pit lane. In the space of a few minutes, a dozen pink, green and blue buses speed in and out, with passengers descending and mounting through all available doors. The arrivals board, displaying destinations such as Grande-Synthe, Cappelle-la-Grande and Malo-les-Bains, ticks over so quickly it’s as if drivers are vying for a podium spot.\nAs the C4 bus pulls in, a teenage girl with chunky headphones and a mother with a baby in a stroller are among those to board. But there are no beeps registering cards, nor the clink of coins used to pay for tickets. Because in this northern French city, no passenger pays.\n“It’s not bad, really not bad,” says Theo, a 23-year-old gardener in the city and a daily user of the service, in typical French understatement. “You never have to wait long. There’s less car traffic and less pollution because of it. And it’s free,” Theo tells Reasons to be Cheerful .\n\nIn 2014, Dunkirk made the decision to get on board with free public transit. Mayor Patrice Vergriete, who has a doctorate in urban planning, pledged during his election campaign that the city would become the largest in France to drop fares on local networks. Today about 150 vehicles — labeled “100% free bus, 7 days a week” — crisscross the city and its surroundings, giving 200,000 residents free access to 18 routes.\n\n“We made this decision to prioritize freedom [for residents] and really create a shock to improve mobility in Dunkirk,” says Jean-François Montagne, the deputy mayor of Dunkirk and head of the region’s ecological transition efforts.\nProponents like Montagne say that making public transit free reduces carbon emissions, air pollution and traffic, and supports low-income households. They also argue that a funding model that relies on government subsidy rather than passenger fares is more resilient in the face of shocks like pandemics. But critics say that there are high costs linked to these policies — and that scaling them up to sprawling metropolitan hubs, just as New York City’s new Mayor Zohran Mamdani has pledged to do, is unlikely to be a smooth ride.\n\nIn Dunkirk, it took four years — from 2014 to 2018 — for efforts to hit the road. First, authorities publicized the program in the media and on the streets, carried out surveys with residents, simplified and reworked timetables, improved the quality of vehicles, repositioned bus stops and increased the size of the fleet. In 2015, they launched free travel on weekends as a testing period, before rolling out the service seven days a week in September 2018.\n\nStory Continues\n“You can’t just make buses free from one day to the next,” says Montagne. “If the service is underused, timetables not well understood, if buses are always late, and you don’t change people’s views of public transit, then it won’t work.”\nCentral to Dunkirk’s strategy was reinventing the image of public buses, which were typically seen as overloaded, unclean and not particularly safe. Authorities now clean buses every day, and if a seat is broken, then it is replaced within a day. Each route, they decided, should have a scheduled arrival every 10 minutes. Smartphone applications also allow passengers to track where and how full their bus is.\n\n“These might seem like small details, but we worked a lot on this,” says Montagne.\nAnd just over a decade since Dunkirk kick-started its free bus program, the policy has hit top gear. According to Dunkirk city hall, the number of bus passengers has increased by 165% since the initiative was introduced.\n“In Dunkirk, it’s led to a huge rise in users, it’s revitalized the city and it works as a kind of social redistribution,” says Maxime Huré, a lecturer in political sciences at France’s University of Perpignan Via Domitia who has studied the program.\n\nA 2019 study by the Observatory of Free Transport Cities, an independent body, found that the policy has led to residents making more trips to the city center, that about half of the new bus riders were taking bus journeys they previously made by car, and that the attractiveness and image of the city has improved.\n\nSeparate research in 2021 found that free buses are helping young people in Dunkirk shift away from the “idealized” image of private car ownership. Indeed, according to Montagne, city hall figures show that 10% of Dunkirk bus users have abandoned their cars since 2018, cutting use of city parking lots by 30%.\nMonique, a 75-year-old retiree, stopped driving two years ago with her weakening eyesight and the ease of the free bus transport as an alternative. She’s pleased that there’s even a standalone night service akin to a city-run Uber service that can be ordered on demand at 10 p.m., taking her directly home for just 2 euros when she goes to the theater.\n“I think it’s really super, it’s very well serviced,” she says.\nIn France, where the transportation sector accounts for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions, a growing number of authorities are getting on board with free public transit. Today more than 45 local authorities have made some form of public transport free for all passengers, including Aubagne, Compiègne and Montpellier. In the latter, where the policy applies only to permanent residents, bus ridership increased by 27% in just one year and the number of people being overexposed to nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant linked to road traffic, fell by 90%.\n\nAnd while Dunkirk has introduced completely free transit, others have adopted other models, such as age-based criteria — in Lille and Strasbourg, for example, bus travel is free for those under 18. Free weekend travel, meanwhile, is offered for everyone in Nantes, Rouen and Nancy.\nBut France is far from the only nation to have introduced free public transit.\nAccording to a 2025 report by Italian researchers, fare-free public transit has been rolled out in 100 places across the world, notably in the U.S., Brazil and European countries such as Poland. Estonia’s capital Tallinn introduced free transit to its 450,000 residents in 2013, and Luxembourg became the first nation in the world where all public transportation is free (except for first class on trains) in 2020.\n\nSome of the oldest examples of fare elimination trace back to the U.S. The California city of Commerce pioneered free buses in 1962 . A 1974 federal law provided $40 million for pilots in Denver and Trenton, New Jersey . More recently, Iowa City eliminated bus fares in August 2023 — paid for with a 1% increase in utility taxes and doubling most public parking rates. The two-year pilot led to ridership exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 18% , with emissions dropping by 778 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.\nYet opinions are divided on whether a major city like Paris, London or indeed New York City could successfully implement a fare-free model.\nSome critics say that free transport systems lead to loss of public income and divert money away from infrastructure upgrades.\n\nA report published in September 2025 by France’s Court of Auditors found that free public transport in smaller cities led to ridership increases at a limited cost, but in larger, already well-used networks, the introduction of free transit is “very costly” because it is accompanied by significant losses in fare revenue and additional costs related to the necessary reinforcement of the existing network, which is under greater strain.\nThe report found that, in Montpellier, free public transport has primarily led to a surge in short trips, more at the expense of walking and cycling than driving. In Lyon, in contrast, where public transit fares have increased — to 90 euros (about $105) for a monthly subscription — the additional funds have made it possible to finance a wider range of transport services and reduce car traffic.\n\nBut Dunkirk authorities defend the scheme. Montagne says the 17 million euro (roughly $19.9 million) annual cost — out of the city’s 500 million euro annual budget — for running the free buses is an important social investment. “The money serves the population, it helps workers, but also families, for leisure, to attend healthcare.”\n“[The Court of Auditors] claim that it devalues the service, but it’s totally the opposite — we have fewer crimes and issues than before.”\nSurveys during Dunkirk’s 2020 municipal elections even found that 99% of respondents ranked the free bus service as the most important public policy.\nHuré argues that, given the percentage of transit network income that passenger fares represent is broadly falling, making buses free is far less radical than it seems: Fare revenue has been declining almost universally. “But politically, it’s presented as a rupture,” he says.\n\nBut whether free buses can work elsewhere depends on other factors such as the capacity of networks to deal with an increase in passengers and funding sources, according to Huré. In France, public transit systems are already partly funded by the versement mobilité , or mobility levy, which relies on a percentage of social security contributions paid by French employers.\n“It could work in large cities, but it depends on the context,” he says.\nThe road ahead appears to show even more places treating buses and mobility as a public good and not a paid privilege. On Jan. 1 of this year, buses and regional trains became free across France’s Lens-Liévin, Hénin-Carvin and Béthune-Bruay metropolitan areas, making it the largest fare-free public transport network in France. Perhaps New York Mayor Mamdani, whose city already sees 1.4 million bus journeys a day , could take the trend to the next level.\n“There is strong demand for free transit,” says Huré, “and I believe it will continue.”\nThis story was produced by Reasons to be Cheerful and reviewed and distributed by Stacker .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The arrivals board, displaying destinations such as Grande-Synthe, Cappelle-la-Grande and Malo-les-Bains, ticks over so quickly it’s as if drivers are vying for a podium spot.\nAs the C4 bus pulls in, a teenage girl with chunky headphones and a mother with a baby in a stroller are among those to board. But there are no beeps registering cards, nor the clink of coins used to pay for tickets. Because in this northern French city, no passenger pays.\n“It’s not bad, really not bad,” says Theo, a 23-year-old gardener in the city and a daily user of the service, in typical French understatement. “You never have to wait long. There’s less car traffic and less pollution because of it. And it’s free,” Theo tells Reasons to be Cheerful .\n\nIn 2014, Dunkirk made the decision to get on board with free public transit. Mayor Patrice Vergriete, who has a doctorate in urban planning, pledged during his election campaign that the city would become the largest in France to drop fares on local networks. Today about 150 vehicles — labeled “100% free bus, 7 days a week” — crisscross the city and its surroundings, giving 200,000 residents free access to 18 routes.\n\n“We made this decision to prioritize freedom [for residents] and really create a shock to improve mobility in Dunkirk,” says Jean-François Montagne, the deputy mayor of Dunkirk and head of the region’s ecological transition efforts.\nProponents like Montagne say that making public transit free reduces carbon emissions, air pollution and traffic, and supports low-income households. They also argue that a funding model that relies on government subsidy rather than passenger fares is more resilient in the face of shocks like pandemics. But critics say that there are high costs linked to these policies — and that scaling them up to sprawling metropolitan hubs, just as New York City’s new Mayor Zohran Mamdani has pledged to do, is unlikely to be a smooth ride.\n\nIn Dunkirk, it took four years — from 2014 to 2018 — for efforts to hit the road. First, authorities publicized the program in the media and on the streets, carried out surveys with residents, simplified and reworked timetables, improved the quality of vehicles, repositioned bus stops and increased the size of the fleet. In 2015, they launched free travel on weekends as a testing period, before rolling out the service seven days a week in September 2018.\n\nStory Continues\n“You can’t just make buses free from one day to the next,” says Montagne. “If the service is underused, timetables not well understood, if buses are always late, and you don’t change people’s views of public transit, then it won’t work.”\nCentral to Dunkirk’s strategy was reinventing the image of public buses, which were typically seen as overloaded, unclean and not particularly safe. Authorities now clean buses every day, and if a seat is broken, then it is replaced within a day. Each route, they decided, should have a scheduled arrival every 10 minutes. Smartphone applications also allow passengers to track where and how full their bus is.\n\n“These might seem like small details, but we worked a lot on this,” says Montagne.\nAnd just over a decade since Dunkirk kick-started its free bus program, the policy has hit top gear. According to Dunkirk city hall, the number of bus passengers has increased by 165% since the initiative was introduced.\n“In Dunkirk, it’s led to a huge rise in users, it’s revitalized the city and it works as a kind of social redistribution,” says Maxime Huré, a lecturer in political sciences at France’s University of Perpignan Via Domitia who has studied the program.\n\nA 2019 study by the Observatory of Free Transport Cities, an independent body, found that the policy has led to residents making more trips to the city center, that about half of the new bus riders were taking bus journeys they previously made by car, and that the attractiveness and image of the city has improved.\n\nSeparate research in 2021 found that free buses are helping young people in Dunkirk shift away from the “idealized” image of private car ownership. Indeed, according to Montagne, city hall figures show that 10% of Dunkirk bus users have abandoned their cars since 2018, cutting use of city parking lots by 30%.\nMonique, a 75-year-old retiree, stopped driving two years ago with her weakening eyesight and the ease of the free bus transport as an alternative. She’s pleased that there’s even a standalone night service akin to a city-run Uber service that can be ordered on demand at 10 p.m., taking her directly home for just 2 euros when she goes to the theater.\n“I think it’s really super, it’s very well serviced,” she says.\nIn France, where the transportation sector accounts for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions, a growing number of authorities are getting on board with free public transit. Today more than 45 local authorities have made some form of public transport free for all passengers, including Aubagne, Compiègne and Montpellier. In the latter, where the policy applies only to permanent residents, bus ridership increased by 27% in just one year and the number of people being overexposed to nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant linked to road traffic, fell by 90%.\n\nAnd while Dunkirk has introduced completely free transit, others have adopted other models, such as age-based criteria — in Lille and Strasbourg, for example, bus travel is free for those under 18. Free weekend travel, meanwhile, is offered for everyone in Nantes, Rouen and Nancy.\nBut France is far from the only nation to have introduced free public transit.\nAccording to a 2025 report by Italian researchers, fare-free public transit has been rolled out in 100 places across the world, notably in the U.S., Brazil and European countries such as Poland. Estonia’s capital Tallinn introduced free transit to its 450,000 residents in 2013, and Luxembourg became the first nation in the world where all public transportation is free (except for first class on trains) in 2020.\n\nSome of the oldest examples of fare elimination trace back to the U.S. The California city of Commerce pioneered free buses in 1962 . A 1974 federal law provided $40 million for pilots in Denver and Trenton, New Jersey . More recently, Iowa City eliminated bus fares in August 2023 — paid for with a 1% increase in utility taxes and doubling most public parking rates. The two-year pilot led to ridership exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 18% , with emissions dropping by 778 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.\nYet opinions are divided on whether a major city like Paris, London or indeed New York City could successfully implement a fare-free model.\nSome critics say that free transport systems lead to loss of public income and divert money away from infrastructure upgrades.\n\nA report published in September 2025 by France’s Court of Auditors found that free public transport in smaller cities led to ridership increases at a limited cost, but in larger, already well-used networks, the introduction of free transit is “very costly” because it is accompanied by significant losses in fare revenue and additional costs related to the necessary reinforcement of the existing network, which is under greater strain.\nThe report found that, in Montpellier, free public transport has primarily led to a surge in short trips, more at the expense of walking and cycling than driving. In Lyon, in contrast, where public transit fares have increased — to 90 euros (about $105) for a monthly subscription — the additional funds have made it possible to finance a wider range of transport services and reduce car traffic.\n\nBut Dunkirk authorities defend the scheme. Montagne says the 17 million euro (roughly $19.9 million) annual cost — out of the city’s 500 million euro annual budget — for running the free buses is an important social investment. “The money serves the population, it helps workers, but also families, for leisure, to attend healthcare.”\n“[The Court of Auditors] claim that it devalues the service, but it’s totally the opposite — we have fewer crimes and issues than before.”\nSurveys during Dunkirk’s 2020 municipal elections even found that 99% of respondents ranked the free bus service as the most important public policy.\nHuré argues that, given the percentage of transit network income that passenger fares represent is broadly falling, making buses free is far less radical than it seems: Fare revenue has been declining almost universally. “But politically, it’s presented as a rupture,” he says.\n\nBut whether free buses can work elsewhere depends on other factors such as the capacity of networks to deal with an increase in passengers and funding sources, according to Huré. In France, public transit systems are already partly funded by the versement mobilité , or mobility levy, which relies on a percentage of social security contributions paid by French employers.\n“It could work in large cities, but it depends on the context,” he says.\nThe road ahead appears to show even more places treating buses and mobility as a public good and not a paid privilege. On Jan. 1 of this year, buses and regional trains became free across France’s Lens-Liévin, Hénin-Carvin and Béthune-Bruay metropolitan areas, making it the largest fare-free public transport network in France. Perhaps New York Mayor Mamdani, whose city already sees 1.4 million bus journeys a day , could take the trend to the next level.\n“There is strong demand for free transit,” says Huré, “and I believe it will continue.”\nThis story was produced by Reasons to be Cheerful and reviewed and distributed by Stacker .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Closer Look at Retirement Plan Managed Accounts\n\nJeffrey H. Snyder\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nBroadcast Retirement Network's Jeffrey Snyder discusses managed account marketing versus research with Ronald Smith, FSA.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWell, Ron, it is so great to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nGood morning, Jeff, and it's a pleasure to be here.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nYeah, and I'm really excited to talk about this. We have talked on the network about managed accounts. You've done some deep diving, deep dive on managed accounts, done a lot of research.\nWhat are some of the key takeaways from your research?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nWell, managed accounts is a large and growing business segment of all DC record keepers. People have different and strong opinions on both sides. People like the concept of personalization, improved retirement outcomes, and the skeptics talk about the cost of the program and whether there are more cost-effective ways to accomplish basically the same goals.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nI know personalization, sorry to interrupt you, personalization is such a big trend in our business these days and everyone's looking for an opportunity to personalize what the end user, that participant receives. Sorry to interrupt, go ahead and continue your thought.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think to a large degree, the DC industry is a commodity. And so wherever the business can show value and differentiation, they're looking to do that. And personalization is one of those topics getting a lot of attention today.\nIn some of my prior corporate lives, I've often been asked to research pitch books or new product innovations with a skeptical eye. Even when you take into account managed account fees and Morningstar assumed 40 basis points in their research, which is pretty reasonable assumption. Even when you take fees into account, you are provided with favorable outcomes really across all ages, all incomes, all types of DC planned designs.\nAnd whether you are a target date fund investor or what they call a do-it-yourself investor. So it sounded too good to be true and that's when I started looking into things. And whenever I read someone else's research, I'm always focused for statements that raise questions.\nSo I started digging in and I said, I'd really like to know just how big a role increased contributions play. Is it 51% or is it 90%? And they didn't specify that.\n\nStory Continues\nSo that makes me a little curious. And then the second part is improved asset allocations with not a whole lot of improvement if you are a target date investor, but more improvement if you're a do-it-yourself investor across all age segments, at least 25% of the population are 0% invested in equities, which is not a very favorable comment on the DC industry. If that many participants are that conservatively invested for what should be a long-term savings goal.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWe've been talking, not to interrupt you, but we've been talking about it for a long time, people investing in money markets, stable value, maybe they're investing in a bond fund. When you're 30 years old, as you know, and probably the audience knows, you want to take advantage of the growth in markets. I mean, compared to what's going on today in the Dow and the S&P 500 , it just lights out.\nSo that makes a lot of sense. And let me just ask you, Ron, I mean, look, when you read research, you got to read it with an eye. And I'm not saying there's not a, I don't think people are looking to mislead.\nI think that at the end of the day, they're looking to create research that supports their thesis. We see this in lots of industry related research, right? I mean, people try to prove, kind of work back and they use the research almost as quasi marketing.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYes. And anyone, I remember as a kid, he had flyer sneakers helped you jump fences until you actually try to jump a fence, then it was not a favorable outcome. So people have been spinning and I'm taking credit for the term spin search, where research and marketing kind of overlap with one another.\nTo give you an example, Morningstar says that the biggest benefits go to younger, newly hired people. And I said to myself, gee, if I was trying to pitch more managed accounts as a QDIA or as a hybrid that maybe kicks in at 50, I would sure like to be telling people that everyone benefits under all plan designs.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nBut let me ask you, what are some of the takeaways? Say I'm the fiduciary, say I'm the investment advisor on the plan. I'm the fiduciary of the plan.\n\nI'm on the committee. What are some of the key takeaways here? Do I need to do more due diligence?\nBecause a lot of times managed accounts are just kind of a bolt on. They just say, during the RFP process, during the selection process, the advisor sometimes doesn't even look at it. So is the takeaway here, do a lot more due diligence, whether it's Morningstar or Financial Engines, one or the other litany of products that are out there?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think the question in my mind is the squeeze worth the juice. And there is a Prudential study that has talked about plan sponsor reluctance to implement managed account until the fees get below 10 basis points. That's the example that people use.\n\nAnd so I think plan sponsors intuitively know that it is an expensive service for what it gives. What it gives is promoting increased savings. And record keepers have been promoting increased savings for decades for free.\nSo you don't have to pay 40 basis points a year for what should be a nudge early on in someone's career, maybe periodic nudges. The other thing is more diversified portfolios. If you're in a target date fund, you are in a pretty well diversified portfolio.\nIt's really the do-it-yourselfers and particularly the very conservatively invested participant who would greatly benefit from diversity. Record keepers have been doing that through the education process for decades as well. The fact that so many people are 0% invested in equity shows that they're not doing a great job.\n\nBut I think there is an ROI for managed accounts. And it's not been publicized because managed accounts are sold as kind of a squishy benefit. Participants, they're going to get better retirement outcomes.\nThey're going to feel better. They're going to feel more confident. But I'm an actuary.\nI'm a numbers guy. And I'm looking for the numbers. So where I would like to see things go, and I think consultants certainly have this capability, is to make a measure of the ROI of putting in managed accounts.\nCompare it to the ROI of an expanded education program, a personalized education program for either low savers or poorly diversified people. Stack that up against what managed accounts offers.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\n\nWell, Ron, it sounds to me like a lot more due diligence is needed. You're going to continue research. Hopefully, you'll be able to come back on the network and we'll talk more about it.\nBut I think the takeaway here is that more due diligence may be needed. Ron, we're going to have to leave it there. Great to see you as always.\nThanks for joining us. And we look forward to having you back on the program again very soon, sir.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nThanks so much, Jeff, for having me. And hope your readers, your listeners got some good benefit out of this.\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 13, 2026, where it first appeared in the Retirement section.

      "Content": "A Closer Look at Retirement Plan Managed Accounts\n\nJeffrey H. Snyder\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nBroadcast Retirement Network's Jeffrey Snyder discusses managed account marketing versus research with Ronald Smith, FSA.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWell, Ron, it is so great to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nGood morning, Jeff, and it's a pleasure to be here.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nYeah, and I'm really excited to talk about this. We have talked on the network about managed accounts. You've done some deep diving, deep dive on managed accounts, done a lot of research.\nWhat are some of the key takeaways from your research?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nWell, managed accounts is a large and growing business segment of all DC record keepers. People have different and strong opinions on both sides. People like the concept of personalization, improved retirement outcomes, and the skeptics talk about the cost of the program and whether there are more cost-effective ways to accomplish basically the same goals.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nI know personalization, sorry to interrupt you, personalization is such a big trend in our business these days and everyone's looking for an opportunity to personalize what the end user, that participant receives. Sorry to interrupt, go ahead and continue your thought.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think to a large degree, the DC industry is a commodity. And so wherever the business can show value and differentiation, they're looking to do that. And personalization is one of those topics getting a lot of attention today.\nIn some of my prior corporate lives, I've often been asked to research pitch books or new product innovations with a skeptical eye. Even when you take into account managed account fees and Morningstar assumed 40 basis points in their research, which is pretty reasonable assumption. Even when you take fees into account, you are provided with favorable outcomes really across all ages, all incomes, all types of DC planned designs.\nAnd whether you are a target date fund investor or what they call a do-it-yourself investor. So it sounded too good to be true and that's when I started looking into things. And whenever I read someone else's research, I'm always focused for statements that raise questions.\nSo I started digging in and I said, I'd really like to know just how big a role increased contributions play. Is it 51% or is it 90%? And they didn't specify that.\n\nStory Continues\nSo that makes me a little curious. And then the second part is improved asset allocations with not a whole lot of improvement if you are a target date investor, but more improvement if you're a do-it-yourself investor across all age segments, at least 25% of the population are 0% invested in equities, which is not a very favorable comment on the DC industry. If that many participants are that conservatively invested for what should be a long-term savings goal.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWe've been talking, not to interrupt you, but we've been talking about it for a long time, people investing in money markets, stable value, maybe they're investing in a bond fund. When you're 30 years old, as you know, and probably the audience knows, you want to take advantage of the growth in markets. I mean, compared to what's going on today in the Dow and the S&P 500 , it just lights out.\nSo that makes a lot of sense. And let me just ask you, Ron, I mean, look, when you read research, you got to read it with an eye. And I'm not saying there's not a, I don't think people are looking to mislead.\nI think that at the end of the day, they're looking to create research that supports their thesis. We see this in lots of industry related research, right? I mean, people try to prove, kind of work back and they use the research almost as quasi marketing.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYes. And anyone, I remember as a kid, he had flyer sneakers helped you jump fences until you actually try to jump a fence, then it was not a favorable outcome. So people have been spinning and I'm taking credit for the term spin search, where research and marketing kind of overlap with one another.\nTo give you an example, Morningstar says that the biggest benefits go to younger, newly hired people. And I said to myself, gee, if I was trying to pitch more managed accounts as a QDIA or as a hybrid that maybe kicks in at 50, I would sure like to be telling people that everyone benefits under all plan designs.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nBut let me ask you, what are some of the takeaways? Say I'm the fiduciary, say I'm the investment advisor on the plan. I'm the fiduciary of the plan.\n\nI'm on the committee. What are some of the key takeaways here? Do I need to do more due diligence?\nBecause a lot of times managed accounts are just kind of a bolt on. They just say, during the RFP process, during the selection process, the advisor sometimes doesn't even look at it. So is the takeaway here, do a lot more due diligence, whether it's Morningstar or Financial Engines, one or the other litany of products that are out there?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think the question in my mind is the squeeze worth the juice. And there is a Prudential study that has talked about plan sponsor reluctance to implement managed account until the fees get below 10 basis points. That's the example that people use.\n\nAnd so I think plan sponsors intuitively know that it is an expensive service for what it gives. What it gives is promoting increased savings. And record keepers have been promoting increased savings for decades for free.\nSo you don't have to pay 40 basis points a year for what should be a nudge early on in someone's career, maybe periodic nudges. The other thing is more diversified portfolios. If you're in a target date fund, you are in a pretty well diversified portfolio.\nIt's really the do-it-yourselfers and particularly the very conservatively invested participant who would greatly benefit from diversity. Record keepers have been doing that through the education process for decades as well. The fact that so many people are 0% invested in equity shows that they're not doing a great job.\n\nBut I think there is an ROI for managed accounts. And it's not been publicized because managed accounts are sold as kind of a squishy benefit. Participants, they're going to get better retirement outcomes.\nThey're going to feel better. They're going to feel more confident. But I'm an actuary.\nI'm a numbers guy. And I'm looking for the numbers. So where I would like to see things go, and I think consultants certainly have this capability, is to make a measure of the ROI of putting in managed accounts.\nCompare it to the ROI of an expanded education program, a personalized education program for either low savers or poorly diversified people. Stack that up against what managed accounts offers.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\n\nWell, Ron, it sounds to me like a lot more due diligence is needed. You're going to continue research. Hopefully, you'll be able to come back on the network and we'll talk more about it.\nBut I think the takeaway here is that more due diligence may be needed. Ron, we're going to have to leave it there. Great to see you as always.\nThanks for joining us. And we look forward to having you back on the program again very soon, sir.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nThanks so much, Jeff, for having me.

      "Content": "Anthropic's funding round: Eye-popping numbers for AI startup behind Claude\n\nNiamh Rowe\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:56 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ANTH.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nAnthropic, the maker of artificial intelligence model Claude, closed a record-setting $30 billion funding round, the start-up announced Thursday.\nThe raise, the largest in private tech history, lifts its valuation to roughly $380 billion, underscoring the intense capital flow into generative AI at a time of heightened competition and market anxiety.\n\nThe Series G round was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and Coatue Management, with participation from major institutional backers including D. E. Shaw Ventures, ICONIQ, MGX and continued commitments from Microsoft and Nvidia, sources familiar with the matter told the Financial Times .\nAnthropic said the fresh capital will accelerate its data-centre expansion, product engineering and global sales efforts as it prepares for an initial public offering possibly later this year. The company has hired law firm Wilson Sonsini to begin IPO preparations, signaling confidence in its long-term growth trajectory, the FT reported.\nThe start-up also reported $14 billion in annualized revenue (an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data), up 1,300% from 2025, and growing over tenfold annually in each of the past three years. Enterprise customers — particularly for its AI coding assistant Claude Code — drove roughly 80% of the $14 billion in run-rate revenue. The firm claims more than 500 corporate clients spending over $1 million a year each on its suite of products.\n\nThe surge has been fueled in part by the release of Claude Opus 4.6, a model capable of processing up to 1 million tokens of context in a single session — enough to ingest codebases, legal archives or corporate internal knowledge without slowing down. That means fewer hand-offs between humans and machine, and longer chains of automated reasoning. It also sharpens Anthropic’s pitch to enterprise clients who want AI embedded deep inside their workflows rather than hovering at the chatbot layer.\nThe Opus 4.6 feature has been widely framed as a competitive shot in the arms race with OpenAI and other start-up labs. But the implications stretch beyond leaderboard rankings rights. If models can absorb entire repositories of institutional memory at once, they begin to encroach not just on junior coding tasks but on higher-margin, knowledge-intensive functions — the core offering of much of the software industry.\n\nThat encroachment is already showing up as market jitters, however. As generative AI firms roll out tools capable of automating analytics, legal drafting and internal productivity systems, investors have started to question the durability of traditional software revenue models built on per-seat licensing and incremental upgrades. Recent sell-offs in segments of enterprise and analytics stocks suggest that Wall Street is attempting to price in a future where AI both deepens its enterprise customers, while also hurting some revenue models.\nYet the private capital flowing into the sector has reached near-stratospheric levels, with reports that OpenAI is seeking a valuation north of $800 billion in a forthcoming round. For now, Anthropic’s latest raise reinforces a prevailing conviction on Wall Street and in private markets: that generative AI will be a central driver of enterprise IT budgets for years to come.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ:MPWR) to $1,500 from $1,300, retaining an Overweight rating on the company’s shares. The boost comes after the company’s fourth-quarter results and first-quarter forecasts, which KeyBanc defined as “strong”. Notably, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.

Deutsche Bank stated on February 2 that it thinks AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP)’s risk-reward profile has “meaningfully improved” after a considerable stock selloff brought on by Google’s Project Genie announcement. The news raised investor worries about potential disruptions for game engine developers, platforms, and publishers, AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) being among them.\nAccording to Deutsche Bank analysts, Project Genie has the potential to streamline game development by serving as a “generative game engine,” enabling individuals with basic coding skills to create games and perhaps cutting development time for gaming companies.\nDespite market fears, Deutsche Bank believes it is “far too early” to predict how disruptive Genie could end up being. The firm anticipates that Genie will improve the game creation process and boost game content generation, which “should ultimately serve to enhance the advertising businesses for both Unity and Applovin.”\n\nAppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is a software-based advertising and app monetization company. It operates through two segments, Advertising and Apps. The company also develops and publishes free-to-play mobile games through its studios and partners.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Goldman Sachs Expects Beat and Raise Quarter for NVIDIA (NVDA)\n\nSheryar Siddiq\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:54 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: GS\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) ranks among the best high growth high margin stocks to buy now . On February 5, Goldman Sachs revised its Buy rating for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with a $250 price target. The firm anticipates a beat-and-raise quarter for the tech giant, citing strong industry supply/demand trends, though it admits that projections for outperformance have already become high.\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nGoldman Sachs believes that near-term stock price growth will be dependent on insight into 2027 revenue, as the upside potential for 2026 has already been built into the stock. The firm highlighted several possible catalysts for higher earnings in the first half of 2026, including sustained positive adjustments to hyperscaler capital expenditure through 2027 and growing trust in demand from unconventional clients like AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nAdditionally, Goldman Sachs emphasized that NVIDIA’s tech superiority might be strengthened by the impressive performance outcomes of new large language models trained on the company’s Blackwell architecture.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm sees a \"compounding execution moat\" for the company in leading edge manufacturing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Rivian surges over 20% on delivery guidance, R2 launch in Q2; CEO says 'key inflection' reached The EV maker also posted a gross profit for Q4, driven by its software and services unit.\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nALI=F\n\nRivian ( RIVN ) stock surged on Friday morning after the EV-maker reported strong delivery guidance for the year, as it ramps up for the release of its R2 vehicle which the company said is on track for the second quarter of this year.\nThe company expects vehicle deliveries for 2026 in a range of 62,000 to 67,000 units, meeting Wall Street estimates of around 63,400 units and suggesting the upcoming R2 will boost sales.\nCrucially, the company said its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle is targeting customer deliveries for the second quarter, after early manufacturing validation builds rolled off the assembly line in January.\nRivian stock surged over 20% in early trade on Friday.\n\n\"This is for us a really key inflection here, where we're going to demonstrate the long term profitability of the business with R2, such an important program for us in terms of adding scale to business,\" CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nThat being said, Rivian sees its adjusted EBITDA loss for 2026 in a range of $1.80 billion to $2.10 billion versus a loss of $1.8 billion expected, with capital expenditures of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, meeting estimates of $2.05 billion.\n\n\"RIVN provided solid FY26 delivery guidance while providing EBITDA targets below the Street expectations as the company ramps its new and existing vehicle lines to generate stable revenue growth while investing strategically across the business,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients.\nAnd for a second quarter in a row, the company posted a gross profit of $120 million, broken down between a loss of $59 million for the automotive segment and a $179 million gain from software and services. Rivian said the jump in software and services profit is due to \"vehicle architecture and software development services\" stemming from its joint venture with Volkswagen ( VOW3.DE ).\nFor the year, Rivian's adjusted EBITDA loss came in at $2.063 billion, wider than estimates of $1.8 billion but within the company's forecast. Capital expenditures for the year hit $1.710 billion, versus estimates of $2.05 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents tallied $6.082 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, around $1 billion less than last quarter. Rivian said it had $6.588 million in total liquidity — crucial as it ramps up R2 production.\n\"We will be opportunistic with regards to additional capital raises,\" Scaringe said, adding that Rivian anticipates another $2 billion in cash and debt from its joint venture with Volkswagen this year.\n\nStory Continues\nRivian's big R2's ramp up is not without risks, however.\n\"The biggest risk in our ramp up, and what we've experienced in the past, and built some skills around managing, is just the complexities of ramping a supply chain, some of the unknowns within the supply chain, and that can be as specific as memory or chip set, or it could be as broad as aluminum supply,\" Scaringe said.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.286 billion versus $1.26 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, down around 27% from a year ago. Rivian attributed the revenue declines to the loss of regulatory emissions credit sales, the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, and lower average selling prices.\nThe company posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.59 versus $0.69 expected, with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $465 million versus $568.2 million expected.\nLast month, Rivian said it produced 10,974 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Ill., and delivered 9,745 vehicles in Q4, with full-year tallies of 42,284 vehicles produced and 42,247 vehicles delivered, reaching the midpoint of its guidance range of 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles delivered. However, Rivian’s original 2025 delivery target was between 46,000 and 51,000.\n\nAs part of the R2 product initiative, the company plans to amp up its AI and tech development, which investors are keen to hear more about.\nLast December, the company said software advancements from its new Autonomy platform and Large Driving Model (LDM), an autonomous model trained similarly to a large language model (LLM), will expand its Universal Hands-Free assisted driving to second-gen R1 vehicles, covering 3.5 million miles in the US.\nLater this year, a point-to-point hands-free system will be released, followed by a hands-free and eyes-free self-driving product, with the ultimate goal of achieving \"personal Level 4\" autonomy, meaning the vehicle will be able to drive fully on its own without requiring the driver's attention.",

Active investors can potentially outperform the market by selecting specific, high-performing securities and holding them.\n\nLet's look at three monster artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy and hold for the next three years.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nBroadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has some of the best growth opportunities of any company over the next three years. With the data center building boom, demand for networking equipment is red hot. And its opportunity with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) is even bigger.\nThe company should be a big winner from Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) huge AI infrastructure spending surge, because Broadcom helps the leader in artificial intelligence make the tensor processing units (TPUs) that power its AI workloads. Meanwhile, Alphabet is beginning to let customers use TPUs for their own workloads through Google Cloud, and Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion order.\n\nOther hyperscalers are also turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, opening up an enormous growth opportunity over the next few years.\nAlphabet Alphabet is becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI. Its core Google Search revenue has accelerated with the introduction of new AI features, and its Gemini AI model has been recognized as among the best. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit has been on fire, with revenue surging 48% last quarter.\nThe company plans to spend big on AI infrastructure this year to capture the opportunity it is seeing. This is a good move, since its TPUs give it a big structural cost advantage over competitors, at less than half the price of Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company's decision to start letting customers deploy these chips within Google Cloud opens up another big revenue driver, with Morgan Stanley estimating that Alphabet has generated $13 billion in revenue for every 500,000 TPUs deployed. As the company with the most complete AI stack -- from its own custom chips to a leading AI model -- Alphabet is a stock to own for the next few years and beyond.\nMicron Technology One of the biggest bottlenecks in building AI infrastructure right now is memory. AI chips need to be packaged with high bandwidth memory (HBM) to optimize their performance, but the process to make HBM is complex and requires upward of three times the wafer capacity of ordinary DRAM (dynamic random-access memory). This has left the entire DRAM market in short supply and is leading to surging prices.\n\nStory Continues\nAs one of the three big DRAM makers -- along with South Korean companies SK Hynix and Samsung -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one of the best ways to play this dynamic. The current environment is leading to surging sales and huge gross margin increases.\nAnd with demand increasing rapidly, the current supply/demand situation for DRAM is likely to remain very tight over the next few years, despite Micron and others increasing capacity. That's an ideal situation for the company.\n\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

Sinkar thinks investors have gotten ahead of themselves with Rigetti. He also believes forward estimates for 2027 are too aggressive.\nThat's mainly because revenue potential could be lower than many believe. Rigetti reported only $1.9 million in third-quarter revenue, while investors are valuing the company at a market cap of nearly $5 billion. That's down from over $18 billion last fall, but it's still lofty given the fundamentals.\n\nRigetti management even believes most demand, and therefore value, for quantum computing will materialize after 2030. Rigetti stock is starting to reflect the view that returns could still be years away. Quantum computing may ultimately give businesses, governments, and universities a much more powerful platform.

We're not ready to say exactly how yet, so stay tuned.\"\nThe Apple CEO acknowledged that the company doesn't spend a lot of time looking back at history, instead focusing on \"what's next.\"\n\"We've really had to work hard on this to get in a reflective state, but when you really stop and pause and think about the last 50 years, it makes your heart sing.

Trump’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing is expected to include discussion about plans to export Nvidia Corp.’s H200 chips to China, and Alibaba is among the companies that could seek to get them.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMamdani’s Grocery Plan Takes Shape In Economic Policy Shift\nThe Best Tactics for Tackling Speeders\nNY Private School Startup Seeks Edge by Giving 42% Fee Discount\nNew York Faces Slippery Evening Commute as Storm Moves in Fast\nNew Zealand Net Migration Sinks to Lowest Level in More Than a Decade\nThe list also included RoboSense Technology Co. and wireless router maker TP-Link Technologies Co.\nAlibaba’s American depositary receipts shares fell as much as 5% in extended trading on Friday. Inclusion on the list could amount to a serious challenge for Alibaba, which is stepping up efforts to compete globally in artificial intelligence.\n“There’s no basis to conclude that Alibaba should be placed on the Section 1260H List,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy. We will take all available legal action against attempts to misrepresent our company.”\n\nBaidu’s receipts were down 4.5%. Spokespeople for Baidu didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular office hours.\nThe list, first published in 2021, now includes more than 130 entities accused of working with the Chinese military. The names include those of airlines, construction companies, shipping companies, computer hardware manufacturers and communications companies.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg had indicated in October that Alibaba, BYD, Robosense and other companies would be added to the list when he sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Bloomberg reported at the time.\nAn analysis by the law firm of Hogan and Lovells said inclusion on the 1260H List has “several direct and indirect implications,” including restrictions on US defense contracts, potential inclusion on other restricted party lists, reputational damage and increased compliance costs.\n--With assistance from Edwin Chan and Debby Wu.\n\nStory Continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

The products it has launched in this space so far are attracting significant demand, and it has even more in the pipeline. In fact, the company just reported its full-year operating results for 2025, and its revenue growth accelerated, partly thanks to its AI products.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nDatadog stock is trading almost 37% below its November 2025 record high, but Wall Street thinks this might be an opportunity. The majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given the stock a buy rating, and their consensus price target points to significant potential returns. Here's why their bullishness might be justified.\nDatadog's AI products are seeing significant demand In mid-2024, Datadog launched a product called LLM Observability, which helps developers track costs, uncover technical issues, and monitor the quality of the outputs of their large language models (LLMs). These models sit at the foundation of customer-facing AI software, so it is critical that they maintain the highest standard of quality.\nBut not every business has the financial or technical resources to build an LLM from scratch, so some of them adopt models from third-party developers like OpenAI as a shortcut. Datadog looks after these customers with a product called OpenAI Monitoring, which allows businesses to keep track of their usage, costs, response times, and error rates.\n\nBut Datadog isn't stopping there. It's gearing up to launch a series of new observability tools to track the usage and performance of AI agents and coding assistants, which could be extremely popular as more businesses and developers lean on these technologies to help improve their productivity.\nDatadog said 5,500 of its 32,700 customers were using at least one of its AI products at the end of 2025, which was up by a whopping 57% from the year-ago period. The company also said its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which is the bridge between Datadog observability data and customer AI models and software, saw a staggering 11-fold increase in requests compared to the third quarter just three months earlier. In simpler terms, usage of Datadog's AI integrations is exploding.\n\nStory Continues\nRevenue growth accelerated in 2025 Datadog generated $3.43 billion in total revenue during 2025, which was a 28% increase from the year before. It marked an acceleration from the 26% growth the company produced in 2024, and a lot of this momentum is attributable to AI customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter, for example, Datadog's revenue grew by 29% overall, but by 23% if you exclude AI-native customers (these are AI-first companies like OpenAI and Anthropic). That means this very small cohort of just 650 customers accounted for six percentage points of Datadog's total revenue growth for the period -- and this doesn't include the thousands of other customers that are also using the company's various AI tools.\n\nDatadog also had another strong year at the bottom line, bringing in $363.4 million in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income. That was up only marginally compared to 2024, mainly because the company spent aggressively in areas like research and development throughout the year to expand its AI product portfolio.\nWall Street is bullish on Datadog stock The Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts who cover Datadog stock, and 36 of them have given it a buy rating. Eight others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding, and just one recommends selling.\nThe analysts have an average share price target of $185.92, implying Datadog stock could climb by 47% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $260 suggests the stock could more than double instead.\nI think those targets are achievable if Datadog's revenue growth continues to accelerate, especially because its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7, which is near the cheapest valuation since it went public in 2019.\nLast year, Datadog valued its addressable market in the observability segment alone at $52 billion, and it expects that figure to grow by 9% per year through 2029. Based on the company's current revenue, it has barely scratched the surface of that opportunity. But remember, Datadog will soon launch entirely new products in this space for AI agents and coding assistants, which could expand the size of its observability opportunity even further than expected.\n\nAs a result, I think Wall Street analysts are right to be bullish on Datadog stock, especially at its current price.\nShould you buy stock in Datadog right now?

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nYanik Guillemette Announces Major Accolad Integration to Automate Referral Payments and Commercial Incentives\n\nAccolad Technologies Inc.\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nWMT\n\nMONTREAL, Feb. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Yanik Guillemette , technology entrepreneur and Chair of Accolad ’s External Advisory Committee on Technology and Innovation, today announced the deployment of a new automation infrastructure enabling Canadian organizations to instantly manage referral payments, sales incentives, and customer rewards through an expanded digital gift card marketplace.\n\nThis development marks an important milestone for Accolad, whose platform now provides access to more than 200 international digital gift cards , including Amazon, Walmart, Esso, Boston Pizza, and IKEA, while also promoting a strong local ecosystem featuring over 70 recognized Québec-based businesses .\nThese include brands such as Lambert, Mia Bijoux, La Cordée, Strøm Spa Nordique, St-Hubert, and many other Québec companies, allowing organizations to balance operational simplicity with support for local commerce.\nAutomating What Was Previously Manual\nHistorically, referral programs and commercial incentive payments relied on fragmented processes, including manual transfers, physical gift cards, heavy administrative tracking, and significant delays.\n\nAccolad’s new integration is designed to eliminate these operational frictions.\n“Organizations want to reward people quickly — whether it’s a referring customer, a salesperson exceeding targets, or a partner closing a transaction. Until now, these payments were surprisingly complex to manage. Our goal was to make them as simple as sending an email,” said Yanik Guillemette .\nThe platform now enables:\nAutomated referral payments;\nSales contests and performance challenges management;\nDistribution of digital commercial incentives;\nRapid issuance of compensations or promotional rewards;\nIntegration of incentives directly into automated customer journeys.\n\nGrowing Adoption Across Travel and Insurance Industries\nAccolad is seeing accelerating adoption in sectors where financial incentives play a strategic role, including:\n\nTour operators and travel agencies;\nInsurance providers;\nInsurance brokers;\nPartner and affiliate networks.\nThese organizations now use the platform to deliver digital bonuses and rewards to clients or partners, significantly simplifying administrative compliance and accounting processes.\n“In many industries, issuing a bonus or reward remains unexpectedly complicated. Our objective is to transform these payments into an instant, traceable, and fully automated process,” added Guillemette.\nSupporting Local Economies in a Digital Environment\nBeyond automation, Accolad promotes a hybrid approach combining global brands with local merchants.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to the company, this strategy enables organizations to offer meaningful rewards while supporting Québec businesses — an increasingly important factor for employers and corporate partners.\nInfrastructure Designed for the Relationship Economy\nThis integration reflects a broader trend: the rise of the relationship economy, where growth increasingly depends on referrals, partnerships, and customer loyalty alongside traditional acquisition strategies.\n\nAccolad positions its technology as an invisible infrastructure layer enabling large-scale automation of incentive micro-payments.\n“Referral programs and commercial incentives are becoming major growth drivers. Our role is to remove operational complexity so organizations can focus on building stronger relationships with customers and partners,” concluded Yanik Guillemette .\nAbout Accolad\nAccolad is a Canadian technology platform specializing in the automation of recognition programs cards, digital rewards, and commercial incentives. The solution enables organizations to securely distribute rewards and digital payments at scale through an extensive catalogue of local and international brands.\nMedia Contact\nJulie Tessier\nHead of Communications\nAccolad\nEmail: j.tessier@accolad.com\nPhone: 579-274-1477\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b0ba4431-b6d1-4b86-acd3-384bcc6ebcda\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Fundstrat economic strategist Hardika Singh called the offering a long-term investment on a new technology. She highlighted that century bonds are usually issued by older institutions, raising doubts about whether a digital business can survive disruption over time.Ten times oversubscribed, the bond showed high demand from institutional investors seeking long term assets. Singh cited JCPenney and General Motors' century bonds, which experienced financial trouble. She added Alphabet's ability to renew itself over the next century is essential.Major IT companies are investing more in AI infrastructure. Alphabet predicted increased data center and computer investment.Strong investor demand implies sustained trust in highly rated issuers notwithstanding long-term disruption risk and market concentration in major technology firms.Investors will examine if big AI investment boosts profitability and whether credit markets accept long-term corporate debt.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Leading bank calls AI threat to enterprise software \"illogical,\" upgrades five stocks for 2026\n\nProactive\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:30 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: HSBC\n\nCRWD\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nNOW\n\nWall Street's panic over artificial intelligence replacing enterprise software is misguided, according to HSBC's latest research report. The investment bank argues 2026 marks a crucial shift from AI infrastructure build-out to actual monetisation through software, positioning established platforms to benefit rather than suffer from the technology's rise.\n\n\"Market concerns that AI will replace enterprise software are misplaced,\" writes Stephen Bersey, HSBC's head of US technology research, in the February report. The firm upgraded CrowdStrike to 'buy' and maintains 'buy' ratings on Oracle, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Palantir, while downgrading IBM and Asana on structural concerns.\nSoftware companies will capture the lion's share of AI value\nHSBC's core thesis challenges the prevailing narrative that AI coding assistants will disrupt traditional software vendors. The bank draws parallels to the internet era, when initial value creation concentrated in physical infrastructure like servers and fibre optics before shifting decisively to software applications.\n\nThe analysts expect AI hardware scarcity to persist for several years due to GPU shortages, power constraints, and data centre limitations. This scarcity reinforces their view that lasting value will flow to software platforms capable of monetising AI through scalable, repeatable use cases.\n\"We see AI as the primary source of value creation of the software stack, with the largest share of long-term value accruing to software rather than hardware,\" the report states.\nEnterprise complexity creates defensive moats\nHSBC dismisses concerns that large language models will simply rewrite legacy applications. The bank notes that LLMs trained on public data lack knowledge of optimised, large-scale private architectures developed over decades by companies like Oracle and SAP.\n\nEven with strong code, new entrants face daunting barriers, the report argues. Enterprise software requires years demonstrating 99.999% uptime, error-free operations across diverse IT environments, trusted brands, and enterprise sales forces. Switching costs remain prohibitively high given risks of revenue disruption, productivity loss, and unforeseen system failures during platform replacements.\nAgents emerge as the primary monetisation vehicle\nThe bank predicts 2026 will see widespread deployment of task-specific, workflow-embedded AI agents across Fortune 2000 companies and small businesses. Unlike generic chatbots, these agents operate within defined parameters that allow enterprises to manage risks and control usage.\n\nStory Continues\nThis agent-driven approach enables the controlled, governable AI adoption that enterprises demand. HSBC expects inference demand to surpass training requirements over time, driving sustained growth in compute consumption as agentic AI becomes pervasive.\nThe firm characterised 2024 and 2025 as building years focused on developing AI models, infrastructure, and code integration. Now, with those foundations in place, enterprise-level deployment can accelerate. The analysts maintain 'reduce' ratings on CoreWeave and Palo Alto Networks alongside IBM and Asana\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Proto Labs and PayPal have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: PRLB\n\nPYPL\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; February 13, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Proto Labs PRLB, as the Bull of the Day and PayPal PYPL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on &mdash;Amazon AMZN, Meta META and Alphabet GOOGL.\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\nBull of the Day: The market has been flirting with highs again. When that happens, investors tend to chase whatever&rsquo;s moving. But that&rsquo;s not how you win long term. When volatility creeps back in, and it always does, you want stocks with real earnings momentum underneath the hood. The last couple of weeks, the market has begun to show signs of volatility, so it&rsquo;s really a great time to laser in your focus on names with strong earnings momentum.\nStrong earnings momentum like today&rsquo;s Bull of the Day, Proto Labs . Proto Labs is a digital manufacturing company specializing in rapid prototyping and low-volume production. Through CNC machining, injection molding, sheet metal fabrication, and industrial 3D printing, they help engineers go from design to production faster than traditional manufacturers. In a world obsessed with supply chain resilience and speed to market, that&rsquo;s not a bad place to be.\n\nOver the last week, a couple of analysts have really upped the ante on the current year numbers. It&rsquo;s taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate up from $1.59 to $1.80 for the current year. Next year&rsquo;s number is at $1.94. That means we are forecasting 8.43% earnings growth this year and 8.06% next year. That&rsquo;s on revenue growth of 5.95% this year and 5.98% next year.\nManufacturing is quietly undergoing a digital transformation. Companies want shorter lead times, more customization, and less inventory risk. Proto Labs sits right at that intersection. This isn&rsquo;t a flashy AI darling. It&rsquo;s not a meme stock. It&rsquo;s an infrastructure play on modern manufacturing.\nProto Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Proto Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nTechnically speaking, the stock has been building a base after prior declines. When you combine improving technical structure with rising earnings estimates, that&rsquo;s often when institutional money starts to lean in.\nThe stock is really moving in the right direction as these earnings estimates have gone the same way. A consistent track record of earnings beats is underlying the move higher as well. The company has not missed earnings expectations since late 2021.\nBear of the Day: After reporting a mixed quarter last week, PayPal not only cratered 20% but shares fell into the cellar of the Zacks Rank as most analysts lowered full year 2026 and 2027 EPS estimates.\n\nStory Continues\nThis year's Zacks EPS consensus dropped from $5.83 to $5.38, representing projected growth of only 1.3%. And next year was clipped 11% from $6.64 to $5.91 in the past two months.\nAnd this week, the analyst continue to condemn to the business with Truist Securities maintaining a \"Sell\" rating and slashing their price target from $58 to $39.\n\nQuarter Highlights Paypal reported $8.68 billion in revenue for the quarter ended December 2025, representing a year-over-year increase of 3.7%. But EPS of only $1.23 for the same period barely limped over the $1.19 post a year ago.\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of -1.07% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.77 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $1.29, the EPS surprise was -4.36%.\nThis article explains more about the company's business...\nPayPal Reports Q4: What Key Metrics Have to Say\n\nPYPL&rsquo;s Revenue Details TPV was $475.14 billion for the fourth quarter, up 8.5% year over year on a reported basis and 6% on a forex-neutral basis.\n\nThe transaction margin in dollar terms was $4.03 billion, which grew 2.5% on a reported basis. Excluding interest on customer balances, transaction margin dollars increased 3.8% to $3.74 billion.\nTransaction revenues were $7.82 billion (90.1% of net revenues), up 3% year over year. Value Added Services revenues were $857 million (9.9% of net revenues), which rose 10.2% year over year.\n\nNet revenues from the United States totaled $4.94 billion (57% of net revenues), up 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. International net revenues were $3.73 billion (43% of net revenues), up 2.7% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a forex-neutral basis.\nPayPal witnessed year-over-year growth of 1.2% in total active accounts to 439 million in the reported quarter. The total number of payment transactions was 6.75 billion, up 2% on a year-over-year basis. However, PYPL&rsquo;s payment transactions per active account were 57.7, which dropped 4.8% year over year.\nBottom line: As banks become more agile and mobile with services, there's been lots of disruption in the fintech space for an early pioneer like PayPal, to say nothing of all the new competition. According to analysts, expect that trend to continue.\n\nAdditional content: Why Have Tech Stocks Lost Their Mojo? The Tech sector&rsquo;s 2025 Q4 earnings results have been very good. But what accounts for the group&rsquo;s stock market underperformance in recent days can broadly be connected to two factors. At one level is the resumption of the market&rsquo;s unease with the ever-rising capex budgets from the Mag 7 group.\nThis isn&rsquo;t a new issue and has been with us for some time, but this reemerged as a headwind for the group after bigger-than-expected capex announcements from Amazon , Meta and Alphabet on their respective Q4 earnings calls.\n\nThe other issue is tied uncertainty around the legacy software business in the coming AI world, with many investors fearing that these software operators may not be as profitable going forward as they have been in the past.\nWith respect to actual earnings, both results for 2025 Q4 and outlook for the current and coming quarters, the Tech sector remains well positioned. The group has been a key growth driver over the last few years and it continues to play that role in the 2025 Q4 earnings season and is expected to remain a leader in the coming periods as well.\nIn terms of the Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 358 S&P 500 members or 71.6% of the index&rsquo;s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +13% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating EPS estimates and 72.1% beating revenue estimates.\n\nTo learn more about the Q4 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> Analyzing the Evolving Earnings Picture: What Should Investors Know?\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "GLW Rides on Solid Traction in Optical Communication: Will it Sustain?\n\nAritra Chatterjee\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GLW\n\nCIEN\n\nAPH\n\nMETA\n\nCorning Incorporated GLW is benefiting from healthy traction in the Optical Communications segment. The company generated $6.3 billion in revenues from this segment in 2025, registering impressive growth of 35% year over year. In 2025, the company’s enterprise network business grew a staggering 61% year over year. Corning started to ship data center products in early 2025, and its sales have increased significantly since then.\n\nHigh bandwidth, optimized power consumption and reduced space usage are critical for AI workloads. Corning’s high-density fiber, cable and connectivity solutions effectively match these requirements.\n\nGen AI-driven data center buildouts are a major growth driver for Corning. The company has garnered solid market traction among hyperscaler customers. GLW recently inked a multiyear agreement with Meta Platforms. The deal is valued at $6 billion. Meta is set to utilize Corning’s leading-edge optical fiber, cable and connectivity products needed for high-speed AI data centers. Similar long-term agreements with other hyperscalers are under negotiation. GLW is set to benefit from hyperscaler AI data center spending in the upcoming quarters. The company’s carrier network business grew 15% year over year, backed by solid demand for data center interconnect.\n\nCorning’s risk-sharing business model, which includes customer prepayments and stringent long-term customer commitments, reduces risk associated with fluctuating demand and capex. Such approach bodes well for sustainable growth.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Corning faces competition from Amphenol Corporation APH and Ciena Corporation CIEN in this domain. The growing use of AI and machine learning applications is driving demand for Amphenol’s high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect solutions. Amphenol is witnessing solid traction in its Communications Solutions segment. The segment generated $3.42 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 77.5% year over year.\n\nCiena has been diversifying its footprint in the data center connectivity vertical. It is increasingly investing in the data and optical fiber market to cash in on the tremendous growth opportunity presented by bandwidth demand from network service providers. Ciena generated $1.05 billion in revenues from the Networking Platforms segment, up 22% year over year.\n\nCorning's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Corning has gained 152.3% compared to the communications components industry’s growth of 179.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, GLW is currently trading at a discount compared with the industry. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 41.88 forward 12-month earnings, lower than 42.62 for the industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for Corning for 2025 and 2026 have increased over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCorning currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Top Drone Tech Stocks to Watch as Adoption Accelerates\n\nVaishali Doshi\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:29 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nAn updated edition of the Dec 24, 2025 article.\nThe global drone technology market is entering a new phase of expansion, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) and cloud computing.\nThe embedding of AI has made modern drones faster and more versatile than ever. AI incorporation is driving the autonomous navigation functionality of drones, enabling them to autonomously plan their flight paths based on real-time data, such as environmental terrain. The integration of 5G and advanced Wi-Fi technology has improved real-time data transmission, expanding commercial applications.\n\nOnce a key defense application, drones are now gaining rapid mainstream adoption, reshaping how governments, businesses and consumers approach border defense, surveillance, logistics and infrastructure monitoring. Drones have become integral to various sectors like mining, infrastructure monitoring, real estate, oil and gas exploration and even filmmaking. Retail behemoths like Walmart and Amazon are increasingly deploying drones in logistics for last mile delivery.\nThe defense segment continues to serve as a major growth engine. Within the defense vertical, growing geopolitical strains and defense upgrades are driving increased drone adoption worldwide. Globally, drones are now being widely deployed for border security, precision strikes, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (&ldquo;ISR&rdquo;), and other tactical operations, making them indispensable assets in modern warfare.\n\nDrone swarm technology is another eye-catching development. Drone swarms are a synchronized operation of numerous autonomous drones working in tandem and using AI and real-time communication to achieve common objectives. In an asymmetric fight, a well-coordinated swarm attack could subdue enemy air defenses, giving the smaller armies an edge. Apart from military operations, the usage of drone swarms is being extensively explored for tasks like large-area surveillance and search-and-rescue.\nWith regulatory frameworks evolving and military and commercial adoption gaining pace, the drone sector has a long runway for growth. The unmanned aerial vehicle (&ldquo;UAV&rdquo;) drones market is expected to witness a CAGR of 16.77% from 2026 to 2035, according to a report from Precedence Research.\n\nMoreover, the shift toward the &ldquo;drone-as-a-service&rdquo; model is opening recurring revenue streams through software subscriptions and maintenance services, thereby improving the visibility for drone tech companies.\nIf you are looking to capitalize on this trend, our Drone Technology Screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks, such as Ondas, Inc. ONDS, Draganfly Inc. DPRO and Red Cat Holdings, Inc. RCAT.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 36 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Investing Screens and uncover your next big opportunity.\n3 Drone Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Ondas is gaining from pivot to autonomous systems via its Ondas Autonomous Systems (&ldquo;OAS&rdquo;) segment. A rapidly expanding opportunity set encompassing strategic partnerships (Rift Dynamics) and NDAA-compliant U.S. production readiness bodes well for OAS. New opportunities in the C-UAS segment and ground robotics offerings, particularly within the Unmanned Ground Vehicle portfolios, further strengthen Ondas&rsquo; long-term growth profile.\n\nONDS is focusing on M&A to strengthen portfolio offerings and broaden reach across multiple domains like unmanned ground systems, robotics and fiber optic communications, subsurface intelligence and demining robotics. In the past few months, it has acquired Sentrycs, Apeiro Motion, Zickel, among others. ONDS acquired Roboteam, a company specializing in multi-mission tactical ground robotics. It recently announced an agreement to buy Rotron Aero, a UK-based developer of advanced UAS and long-range autonomous platforms.\n\nAt its investor day, ONDS highlighted that its pro forma cash balance exceeded $1.5 billion, adjusted for its recently completed equity offering of approximately $1 billion, providing substantial financial flexibility for both organic and inorganic expansion.\n\nFor 2026, Ondas has raised its revenue outlook to $170-$180 million, representing a 25% increase over the previous target of $140 million, which included an estimated $30 million contribution from Roboteam. This upward revision underscores improved backlog and revenue visibility.\n\nONDS carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nDraganfly is a Canada-based drone solutions and systems developer. The company&rsquo;s drones include the Commander 3XL, Heavy Lift Drone, Commander 2 and Draganfly Medical Response Drone. The company&rsquo;s Apex drone is aimed at ISR, marketed for both the military and public safety. Apex drone boasts dual payload capabilities and AI computing, powered by NVIDIA&rsquo;s chips. Further, DPRO&rsquo;s NDAA-compliant FlexForce FPV (first-person view) drone can be flown individually or autonomously, or swarmed.\n\nDPRO has 5-plus drone systems that are all NDAA-compliant. As the United States and NATO aggressively eliminate non-compliant Chinese systems from critical infrastructure, this compliance advantage becomes a moat. In October 2025, the company introduced its Outrider Southern Border drone, which is a North American-built, NDAA-compliant multi-mission drone platform.\n\nIncreasing deals with the U.S. military bode well. One of the most significant developments is the company&rsquo;s first major U.S. Army FPV drone order, which is not only a product sale but also includes providing supply chain and logistical support. It also includes onsite assembly and manufacturing training for the Army to allow them to make &ldquo;modifications on the fly.&rdquo; DPRO recently won a contract along with its partner, DelMar Aerospace Corporation, to supply Flex FPV Drones and Training to U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nDPRO, a Zacks Rank #2 stock at present, is expanding its footprint in the demining vertical with collaborations with Autonome Labs and SafeLane. With its data, expertise and AI-powered aerial mapping capabilities, DPRO is well-positioned to expand in this niche market. In the last reported quarter, the company achieved 14.4% year-over-year revenue growth, supported by rising product sales.\n\nRed Cat Holdings specializes in robotic hardware-software integration for applications for both military and commercial uses. Teal Drones and FlightWave Aerospace are two of its wholly-owned affiliates. The company is also broadening its reach into the maritime sector through Blue Ops, Inc., where it is developing uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). Its portfolio also includes Black Widow (small, unmanned aircraft systems), TRICHON (a hybrid VTOL) and FANG, an NDAA-compliant FPV drone.\n\nRCAT is witnessing solid demand from defense and government clients and expanding program wins. The company is also sharpening its ability to rapidly scale production to meet mission-critical requirements. On the last earnings call, management emphasized &ldquo;factories are the moat,&rdquo; with expanded facilities in Salt Lake City, UT, and Los Angeles, and a newly opened 155,000-square-foot plant in Georgia (large-scale USVs manufacturing).\n\nThe inclusion of the FANG FPV drone on the Blue UAS cleared list, NATO NSPA catalog approval for the Black Widow system, and integration of Palantir&rsquo;s Visual Navigation software for Black Widow in GPS-contested environments materially expand Red Cat&rsquo;s addressable market.\n\nRCAT, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), recently reported preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2025. Fourth-quarter 2025 revenues are expected to be between $24 million and $26.5 million, significantly up from $1.3 million reported in the prior-year period, while 2025 revenues are projected to be between $38 million and $41 million, up about 153% from $15.6 million posted in 2024. The upward revision is driven by strong execution across the board.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Will Data Center Unit Help NVIDIA Reach Its $65B Q4 Revenue Goal?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 25, and it would be no surprise if the company reaches another sales milestone and surpasses the $65 billion target. NVDA has been setting new sales records for the past few quarters. In the last reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, its revenues reached a new record of $57.01 billion, reflecting a 62% year-over-year increase.\n\nNVIDIA is optimistic that the growth momentum will continue as it again targets record revenues of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. The key driver behind this outlook is its booming data center business, which continues to power the company’s growth amid the global buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the data center business unit reported $51.22 billion in revenues, up 66% from last year.\nThe segment reached new highs as demand for accelerated computing, generative AI, and large-scale model training continued to rise across cloud providers and enterprise customers. Much of the momentum came from the rapid adoption of the GB300 platform and wider deployment of NVIDIA’s networking products, including NVLink and Spectrum-X. With hyperscalers racing to expand AI capacity, NVIDIA remained a key beneficiary of record spending on high-performance infrastructure.\n\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance graphics processing unit clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the data center segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $58.72 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nThe growing demand for the company’s AI chips used in data centers is likely to continue aiding its overall top-line performance. Analysts’ projections also suggest that the company is expected to surpass the fourth-quarter sales target of $65 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $65.56 billion, calling for a year-over-year surge of 66.7%.\n\nNVIDIA’s Competitors in the AI Data Center Space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC are two major companies that are competing closely with NVIDIA in the AI data center space.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is gaining traction with its MI300 series accelerators, which are designed to handle training and inference for large AI models. AMD’s chips have attracted interest from major cloud providers seeking diversification beyond NVIDIA’s ecosystem. While Advanced Micro Devices’ software stack is still developing, its performance and pricing advantages make it a credible alternative.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel is also reasserting its presence with the Gaudi series of AI accelerators. The company is positioning Gaudi3 as a cost-effective and scalable option for AI data centers, targeting enterprise clients looking for flexibility. Intel’s broad reach in CPUs and server infrastructure helps it integrate AI solutions more easily into existing systems.\n\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 34.6% over the past year compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 36%.\nNVIDIA One-Year Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.36, below the industry’s average of 28.62.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.9% and 57%, respectively.

      "Content": "Here Are Friday’s Top Wall Street Analyst Research Calls: Airbnb, AMD, Broadcom, CrowdStrike, Dollar Tree, Medtronic, Pinterest, Rivian, Roku, Tapestry, and More\n\nLee Jackson\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:01 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nCRWD\n\nDLTR\n\nkeypoints]\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\nFutures are trading higher after the January consumer price index report came in below expectations at 2.4%, as we head into the close of a rollercoaster week that saw a little of just about everything. After opening strongly on Thursday, stocks immediately rolled over. By the first hour mark, they were down sharply, and although stocks didn't close at the lows, they remained down for the rest of the session. With a variety of issues weighing on stocks and a big rotation out of technology after three years of double-digit gains, we could be setting up for a sizable correction. Losses were steep across the board Thursday, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 2.04% at 22,597. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at 6,832, down 1.57%, and the Dow Jones Industrials were last at 49,451, down 1.34%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was also down more than 2% to 2,615.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Yields plummeted across the Treasury yield curve as investors ran for the safety and security of guaranteed U.S. government paper. The rally was fueled by weak economic data, including rising jobless claims and declining job openings, which increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, with the solid jobs numbers earlier in the week, and if todays consumer price index numbers come in higher than expected all bets are likely off. The 30 year long bond closed at 4.74%, while the ten year nore closed at 4.10%.\n\nOil and Gas: Oil and energy stocks have made a strong start in the first six weeks of 2026, but were hammered on Thursday after the International Energy Agency cut its 2026 demand growth outlook. With a sector already worried about oversupply, that was all it took to bring in the sellers. Brent Crude closed Thursday at $67.65, down 2.52%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the day at $62.98, down 2.55%. Natural gas was the lone winner in the sector, rising 1.87% to close at $3.21.\n\nGold: After a stunning bounce back from the recent flash-crash, gold took a solid hit on Thursday with the rest of the market. The bullion finished the day down 3.19% at $4,920. Falling below the $ 5,000-per-ounce level, which has been considered near-term support, was driven primarily by strong U.S. labor market data. This data reduced expectations for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and triggered a cascade of selling pressure as investors cut losses. As mentioned, if the CPI data comes in below expectations you can expect more buying. Silver also closed lower Thursday down a massive 10.65% at $75.19.\n\nStory Continues\nCrypto: The Crypto markets saw heavier selling on Thursday, with Bitcoin entering a deep rout and crypto-related stocks posting sharp declines following a prolonged, multi-month selloff. Sentiment for crypto currencies as a whole continue to be downbeat, with trading volumes slowing during the fourth-quarter 2025 selloff that has extended into February. At 8 AM EST Bitcoin is trading at $67,042, while Ethereum is quoted at $1,958.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

      "Content": "Here Are Friday’s Top Wall Street Analyst Research Calls: Airbnb, AMD, Broadcom, CrowdStrike, Dollar Tree, Medtronic, Pinterest, Rivian, Roku, Tapestry, and More\n\nLee Jackson\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:01 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nCRWD\n\nDLTR\n\nkeypoints]\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\nFutures are trading higher after the January consumer price index report came in below expectations at 2.4%, as we head into the close of a rollercoaster week that saw a little of just about everything. After opening strongly on Thursday, stocks immediately rolled over. By the first hour mark, they were down sharply, and although stocks didn't close at the lows, they remained down for the rest of the session. With a variety of issues weighing on stocks and a big rotation out of technology after three years of double-digit gains, we could be setting up for a sizable correction. Losses were steep across the board Thursday, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 2.04% at 22,597. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at 6,832, down 1.57%, and the Dow Jones Industrials were last at 49,451, down 1.34%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was also down more than 2% to 2,615.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Yields plummeted across the Treasury yield curve as investors ran for the safety and security of guaranteed U.S. government paper. The rally was fueled by weak economic data, including rising jobless claims and declining job openings, which increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, with the solid jobs numbers earlier in the week, and if todays consumer price index numbers come in higher than expected all bets are likely off. The 30 year long bond closed at 4.74%, while the ten year nore closed at 4.10%.\n\nOil and Gas: Oil and energy stocks have made a strong start in the first six weeks of 2026, but were hammered on Thursday after the International Energy Agency cut its 2026 demand growth outlook. With a sector already worried about oversupply, that was all it took to bring in the sellers. Brent Crude closed Thursday at $67.65, down 2.52%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the day at $62.98, down 2.55%. Natural gas was the lone winner in the sector, rising 1.87% to close at $3.21.\n\nGold: After a stunning bounce back from the recent flash-crash, gold took a solid hit on Thursday with the rest of the market. The bullion finished the day down 3.19% at $4,920. Falling below the $ 5,000-per-ounce level, which has been considered near-term support, was driven primarily by strong U.S. labor market data. This data reduced expectations for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and triggered a cascade of selling pressure as investors cut losses. As mentioned, if the CPI data comes in below expectations you can expect more buying. Silver also closed lower Thursday down a massive 10.65% at $75.19.\n\nStory Continues\nCrypto: The Crypto markets saw heavier selling on Thursday, with Bitcoin entering a deep rout and crypto-related stocks posting sharp declines following a prolonged, multi-month selloff. Sentiment for crypto currencies as a whole continue to be downbeat, with trading volumes slowing during the fourth-quarter 2025 selloff that has extended into February. At 8 AM EST Bitcoin is trading at $67,042, while Ethereum is quoted at $1,958.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

      "Content": "4 ETFs to Capitalize on the Great Market Rotation\n\nSanghamitra Saha\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: XLP\n\nVHYAX\n\nVYM\n\nSPYV\n\nFXU\n\nWall Street is currently witnessing the &ldquo;Great Rotation,&rdquo; with investors shunning hot technology stocks in favor of smaller companies and other defensive sectors. The combination of &ldquo;AI capex fatigue,&rdquo; a resilient U.S. economy, and chances of a less-dovish Fed in the near term has led to the rotation in the market.\n\nInside the Emergence of Great Rotation The five largest U.S. cloud and AI infrastructure providers &ndash; Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle &ndash; have planned to spend between $660 billion and $690 billion combined capital expenditure in 2026, nearly doubling 2025 levels, as quoted on Futurum.\nMeanwhile, pure-play AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are seeing strong revenue growth, but their combined revenues are nowhere near the massive infrastructure spending made on them, per the same Futurum source.\nNo wonder, investors have started demanding clearer returns on massive spending after two years AI capex euphoria; Second, higher interest rates &mdash; with the 10-year Treasury yield over 4% &mdash; are pressuring long-duration growth valuations, pushing investors toward defensive and value sectors that normally fare better in higher-rate environments.\n\nThird, broadening market breadth, with about 65% of S&P 500 stocks outperforming the index &ndash; a level not seen in years, shows leadership expanding beyond mega-cap tech (read: A \"Great Rotation\" Is Underway: Zacks FEB 2026 Strategy).\nAs a result, the State Street SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV has added about 1.1% over the past one month (as of Feb. 12, 2026) versus a 1.8% decline in the State Street SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY. Meanwhile, growth stocks severely underperformed with State Street SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG slumping 4.3% during the same timeframe.\nETFs to Play Given the great rotation, some exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were depressed last year, have started to gain momentum this year. We have highlighted them below:\nState Street Cons Staples Sel Sec SPDR Inc ETF XLP\nThe fund has gained about 10% over the past one month (as of Feb. 12, 2026), breezing past SPY. XLP rose 9.6% over the past one year, down from the 11.7% one-year uptick in SPY. Staples companies and stocks are viewed as non-cyclical and tend to perform well even in an uncertain economy.\nFirst Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund FXU\nThe ETF has gained 7.8% over the past month. Utilities act as a defensive sector. Moreover, to support the power-hungry AI boom, utilities have received a leg up in today&rsquo;s environment. The fund has jumped about 22.9% over the past one year.\n\nStory Continues\nVanguard High Dividend Yield ETF VYM\nSeeking shelter in high-income ETFs also makes sense. In a volatile market, dividend ETFs normally come to the rescue. The hunt for dividends in the equity market is always on, irrespective of how the market is behaving. The ETF VYM has added about 4.7% over the past one month. The fund yields 2.24% annually.\n\nState Street SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF SPSM\nSmall caps have outperformed large-caps so far this year, supported by domestic focus, dollar strength and improving earnings outlook.The S&P SmallCap 600 index is projected to return to positive growth in 2025, with double-digit earnings expansion expected over the next two years, per Zacks Earnings Trends issued on Feb. 4, 2026. The SPSM ETF has added 2.3% over the past one month (read: 3 Sector ETFs & Stocks to Play in the Small-Cap Spectrum).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The Best Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 4:55 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KO\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nIt's not terribly difficult to find a decent dividend-paying stock. Finding one you can buy and hold forever, however, is a different story.\nThe underlying company must offer a product or service that will always be in demand. And that company's culture must be one that ensures perpetual success. These two standards will exclude most prospects.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nSuch dividend stocks are out there though, even if they're few and far between.\nHere's a closer look at three of them you can feel good about adding to your \"forever\" portfolio today.\n1. Coca-Cola Yes, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) shares fell following the release of the company's fourth-quarter results. Although per-share earnings of $0.58 topped analysts' estimates of $0.56, revenue of $11.82 billion came up slightly short of expectations.\nIt wasn't just the revenue miss responsible for the stock's weakness, however. Guidance for organic revenue growth of between 4% and 5% and per-share earnings growth of 7% to 8% wasn't quite what investors were hoping for either. March's upcoming switch to a new CEO -- current Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun -- also adds an element of uncertainty to Coca-Cola's future.\n\nFor income-minded long-term investors though, these are trivial details. Coca-Cola and all of its beverage brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Barq's root beer (just to name a few) are as endearing as they are enduring. It doesn't really matter who's at the helm.\nMoreover, while guidance for the year now underway may have been a bit of a letdown, sales and earnings are still outpacing inflation, supporting what's grown into a 63-year uninterrupted stretch of yearly per-share dividend payout increases. You'd be stepping into a forward-looking yield of 2.7%.\n2. Verizon With the United States' mobile phone market being as crowded and competitive as it is (Pew Research reports 98% of the nation's adults now own a mobile phone) clearly there's not a great deal of potential for capital growth with a stake in Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) . Yet what this telecom giant lacks in raw growth firepower, it more than makes up for in the form of income. The stock's forward-looking yield currently stands right around 6%. You'd be hard-pressed to find better from a name with comparable risk.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd there's longevity here to be sure.\nWhile it's not a statistic to be proud of, a 2024 survey performed by Harmony Healthcare IT suggests the average American spends more than five hours per day looking at their mobile phone. Right or wrong, they're not about to let go of their handheld connection to the outside world now.\n\n3. Realty Income Finally, add Realty Income (NYSE: O) to your list of dividend stocks to buy and hold forever.\nIt's a real estate investment trust, or REIT for short. That just means it's a landlord, and passes along the majority of its rent-based profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Realty Income's focus is on brick-and-mortar retailing. Its top tenants include 7-Eleven, Dollar General , FedEx , Walmart , and Home Depot .\nIt sounds scary, given the e-commerce-driven headwind that all brick-and-mortar retailers seem to be facing now.\n\nRealty Income is largely sidestepping this challenge, however, by serving the retail industry's most resilient names. Proof of this resiliency lies in the fact that this REIT's occupancy rate currently stands at 98.7%, and that it's now raised its monthly dividend payment -- yes, monthly -- for 31 consecutive years. Newcomers will be stepping into a yield of just over 5.1%.\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now? Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Prediction: Alphabet Will Be a $5 Trillion Stock by the End of 2027\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 4:39 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nThere are 12 publicly listed companies around the world valued at $1 trillion or more, with some of them graduating into the $2 trillion, $3 trillion, and even $4 trillion clubs. However, only Nvidia has crossed the exclusive $5 trillion milestone, although only for a very brief period last October, because its stock has since lost around 8% of its peak value.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and more. These businesses have laid the foundation for the company's highly successful artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, which is driving incredible value for its shareholders. In fact, its stock has soared by 73% over the last 12 months alone.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAlphabet has a market capitalization of $3.92 trillion as I write this, and here's why I think it has a clear pathway to the $5 trillion club.\nAI has transformed Google Search When the AI boom started gathering momentum in early 2023, investors were worried chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT would steal internet traffic away from traditional search engines. This would've dealt a serious blow to Alphabet, because the advertising dollars brought in by Google Search represent more than half of the company's total revenue.\nFortunately, Alphabet moved fast by launching its own family of AI models called Gemini. The latest Gemini 3 models are among the best in the industry, and they are now powering AI Overviews in Google Search, which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide fast answers to almost any query. Overviews appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer need to sift through web pages to find information.\n\nGoogle Search also has another new feature called AI Mode, which allows users to open a chatbot-style interface if they want to expand on a particular search query to find deeper answers. Alphabet says AI Mode queries are three times longer than traditional search queries, on average, so the feature is boosting engagement. In other words, users might be more likely to stick with Google Search now instead of venturing off to use third-party chatbots.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2025 (ended Dec. 31), Alphabet said Google Search saw more usage than ever before thanks to its new AI features. In fact, the platform generated a record $63.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, which was up 17% from the year-ago period. That growth rate accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, which truly highlights its AI-led momentum.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud is amassing a huge order backlog from AI customers While Google Search is Alphabet's largest business, Google Cloud consistently generates the fastest growth. It brought in a record $17.6 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, which was up by an eye-popping 48% year over year. As was the case with Search, this was also the third straight quarter in which Google Cloud's revenue growth accelerated.\nGoogle Cloud has become a top destination for businesses and developers looking to create and deploy AI software. It operates state-of-the-art data centers and rents the computing capacity to its customers for a fee. This infrastructure is fitted with the latest AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia, but Alphabet also designed its own chips called tensor processing units (TPUs) to give customers more optionality. These TPUs were used to train Gemini 3, and they are now being used by leading start-ups like Anthropic.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Google Cloud also offers access to AI platforms, AI agents, and the latest AI models from a variety of third parties, which combine to accelerate its customers' development projects. Alphabet says customers using Google Cloud for AI purposes adopt 80% more products than those that aren't, which highlights how important this technology is for the platform.\nGoogle Cloud ended 2025 with an annual revenue run rate of $70 billion. However, it also ended the year with a staggering $240 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more AI infrastructure to come online, which soared 55% from the previous quarter just three months earlier. This suggests the cloud platform might be poised for even faster revenue growth in the future.\n\nHow Alphabet can achieve a $5 trillion valuation Alphabet generated total earnings of $10.81 per share in 2025, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30. That is a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 31.5, so you could argue Alphabet is cheap relative to its big-tech peers.\nBut looking ahead, Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests Alphabet's earnings could grow to $11.42 per share in 2026, followed by $13.26 per share in 2027, placing its stock at forward P/E ratios of 28.3 and 24.4, respectively.\nIn other words, Alphabet stock would have to soar by 23.4% by the end of 2027 just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 30. That alone would catapult the company's market cap to $4.84 trillion -- a stone's throw away from the exclusive $5 trillion milestone. However, if Alphabet's P/E ratio were to rise slightly higher to trade in line with the P/E of the Nasdaq-100 (31.5), that would be enough to nudge the company's valuation above the $5 trillion mark.\n\nThat is a real possibility in my opinion, considering the significant AI-driven momentum in the Google Search and Google Cloud businesses alone. As a result, Alphabet could be less than two years away from becoming a $5 trillion company.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

The 1 year total shareholder return is also very large, suggesting sentiment around AI infrastructure exposure has shifted quickly in Lumentum’s favour.\nIf Lumentum’s surge has you looking beyond a single name, this could be a good moment to see what else is moving in AI hardware and networking through our screener of 34 AI infrastructure stocks .\nWith revenue, earnings and AI demand all pointing in the same direction, the key question now is whether Lumentum’s current valuation still leaves any upside on the table, or if the market is already paying for future growth.\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 68% Overvalued At the last close of $583.46, the most followed narrative puts Lumentum’s fair value closer to $348.38, creating a wide gap that hinges on aggressive AI optics assumptions.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see what is backing this rich valuation gap? The narrative leans on rapid revenue expansion, sharply higher margins and a future earnings multiple that assumes strong execution. Curious which specific growth and profitability targets have to fall into place? The full narrative lays out the financial path that supports that fair value line by line.\n\nAnalysts contributing to this narrative are building their fair value case using a discount rate of 8.41%, higher revenue growth estimates for cloud and AI related optics, and materially stronger profit margins than today. That combination supports a future earnings profile that, if achieved, could justify paying a premium multiple relative to more traditional communications names, even as the current share price already sits above the narrative’s own fair value estimate.\n\nStory Continues\nResult: Fair Value of $348.38 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this upbeat setup still leans heavily on just a few hyperscale customers and assumes Lumentum can ease current production constraints without stumbling.\nFind out about the key risks to this Lumentum Holdings narrative.\n\nAnother Way to Look at Lumentum’s Value Analysts see Lumentum as 68% overvalued at $583.46 against a $348.38 fair value in the prevailing narrative, but our DCF model points the other way, with an $852.15 estimate suggesting the shares trade about 31.5% below that mark.

      "Content": "Despite the downward trend in earnings at NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) the stock rallies 8.0%, bringing three-year gains to 36%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nBuying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the NXP Semiconductors N.V. ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) share price. It's up 29% over three years, but that is below the market return. In the last year the stock has gained 8.1%.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for NXP Semiconductors investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver the last three years, NXP Semiconductors failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 9.0% (annualized).\nThis means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.7% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. The revenue drop of 3.4% is as underwhelming as some politicians. The only thing that's clear is there is low correlation between NXP Semiconductors' share price and its historic fundamental data. Further research may be required!\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nNXP Semiconductors is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for NXP Semiconductors in this interactive graph of future profit estimates .\nWhat About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of NXP Semiconductors, it has a TSR of 36% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective NXP Semiconductors provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 7% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NXP Semiconductors better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with NXP Semiconductors .\n\nStory Continues\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Will the Stock Market Crash in 2026? Here's What the Data Suggests Will Happen.\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nThe last three years have been quite pleasant for growth investors. Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the technology sector has witnessed a once-in-a-generation boom that's spread to other industries across energy, industrials, utilities, and more. As such, it's been pretty hard to lose money in the stock market in recent years.\n\nUnfortunately, the euphoria train seems to have hit a hiccup in 2026. So far this year, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has gained less than 2% while the Nasdaq Composite is unchanged.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nLet's dig into what's causing the markets to take a breather. From there, we will dig into the strategies smart investors are employing to help weather current market conditions.\nValuation: Is the Shiller CAPE ratio warning of 1999 repeating? If you tune into financial news talk shows, it's common to hear economists and equity research analysts talk about valuation metrics. For instance, analysts love comparing a company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio relative to historical periods to help gauge whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued.\nAlthough this approach can make sense, one of its flaws is that it does not fully account for anomalies such as periods of unusually high inflation or one-time line items that can benefit (or hurt) a company's earnings growth.\n\nFor this reason, smart investors turn to a different metric to help assess current market conditions. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, developed by economist Robert Shiller, accounts for a decade's worth of earnings relative to stock performances over that time frame. In this sense, economic outliers become smoothed out and investors are able to achieve a more normalized look at valuation.\nRight now, the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio is hovering just below 40. The only other time the CAPE ratio was close to its current level was just before the dot-com bubble burst. With this overlap in mind, some investors are wary that history is poised to repeat itself and the stock market is warning us of another 1999 in the making.\n\nAI vs. dot-com: Why this generational shift is and isn't a bubble On the surface, it's easy to call the current AI revolution a stock market bubble given its similarities to soaring stock prices from the late 1990s. While I understand the comparison, I see the AI rally as quite different from the dot-com boom.\n\nStory Continues\nDuring the late 1990s, many companies merely relied on the potential of the internet rather than actually using the online domain to generate revenue or earnings. In other words, businesses were marketing vaporware -- tech products that do not actually work or provide useful efficiencies to their end users.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, many companies during the early days of the internet were hemorrhaging cash and did not, in fact, have a legitimate growth roadmap. The quality of earnings from the AI wave have been much stronger than what investors witnessed two decades ago.\nCloud hyperscalers like Amazon , Alphabet , and Microsoft , as well as AI chip designers Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Micron are all minting money. AI has become an epic bellwether for these and many other companies -- completely revolutionizing their business models and positioning them for long-term success as the multitrillion-dollar AI infrastructure era begins.\nPortfolio playbook: How to invest when markets feel frothy When the stock market feels inflated, it's not uncommon for investors to shift capital from volatile stocks and into more steady, predictable opportunities.\nFor instance, although AI has proven to be a net benefit for enterprise software, some companies have failed to gain meaningful traction or demonstrate that the technology doesn't undermine their business model. This is one reason software stocks are getting clobbered right now. In other words, AI is not a one-size-fits-all market opportunity. You need to be smart about which developers you invest in.\n\nDuring periods of market uncertainty and emotionally driven panic selling, the best approach is often to be boring and play it safe. A specific thing you can do is trim your exposure to speculative or volatile stocks that you're hoping to turn into multibaggers.\nInstead, opt for blue chip stocks with durable, resilient business models. This will help you create a diversified portfolio that's less vulnerable to harsh market corrections. Moreover, complementing these positions with a healthy cash balance will allow you to buy the dip during sell-offs -- doubling down on high-quality positions at a discount that should generate consistent gains for the long term.\nShould you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now? Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAs an investor, it is impossible to know what's coming, although history is often a good guide. But what any smart investor should do is prepare their portfolio for the possibility to maximize gains in any type of environment.\nA great way to do this is to add strong dividend stocks to your portfolio. Not only did they generate income or boost total return when reinvested, but they are also typically value stocks , which tend to perform better in downturns.\n\nHere are two great dividend stocks provide both income and diversification.\nSpice and Spam If the market undergoes a correction or heads sideways for a spell, investors may want to turn to a couple of consumer staples companies that have a long history of consistently generating dividends and outperforming during market downturns.\nOne is Hormel (NYSE: HRL) , the maker of the canned meat product Spam, along with Skippy peanut butter, Dinty Moore beef stew, Planters nuts, Hormel Chili, and other food staples. These are products that are always popular, but they tend to become more sought-after during difficult economic times. It's mostly canned foods or less expensive items that people stock up on when budgets are stretched.\n\nGoing back to 2008, Hormel has outperformed the S&P 500 index in the year when the large-cap benchmark was either negative or had small, 1% or 2% returns.\nThe same is true for McCormick (NYSE: MKC) , the venerable spice maker that first opened its doors in 1889.\nLike Hormel, McCormick makes spices that are more popular during downturns, because people eat in more often, and use spices to give more flavor to cheaper, basic meals. And it also performs better than the larger markets when they are down or sluggish.\nDividend King with a high yield Both of these stocks have struggled in recent years, with negative returns over the past one- and five-year periods.\nBut their dividends remain strong. Hormel is a Dividend King, having increased its payout for 59 consecutive years. It also has one of the highest yields among S&P 500 stocks at 4.69%.\n\nStory Continues\nMcCormick is not far behind, with 39 straight years of dividend increases and a high yield of 2.85%.\nBoth stocks also have solid upside, according to analysts. Hormel has a median price target of $27.50, which would suggest 12% upside. McCormick has a median price target of $73 per share, which would represent an 8% return over the next 12 months.\n\nWith the potential for volatility in 2026, these stocks might provide some nice ballast, reliable income, and some downside protection in a growth-oriented portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Hormel Foods right now? Before you buy stock in Hormel Foods, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hormel Foods wasn’t one of them.

This made people worry about profit expectations in AI-related investment.Concerns about AI taking employment away from people made the market even more unstable. Microsoft's AI director said that a lot of white-collar jobs may be automated, which made the discussion over the economic effects of fast AI adoption even more heated.The Nasdaq dropped more than 2%, but defensive assets went up. U.S. Treasuries drew in safe-haven flows, while gold and silver prices went up after going down recently.The markets are now paying attention to the next U.S. consumer price index data. If the inflation data is weaker, it might raise hopes for a rate drop in June.

      "Content": "AMD Taps Ariel Kelman To Sharpen AI And Data Center Story\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NasdaqGS:AMD) has appointed Ariel Kelman as Chief Marketing Officer.\nThe leadership change comes as AMD increases its focus on AI and data center products.\nKelman brings experience from major technology firms to sharpen AMD's global marketing efforts.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:AMD, this move comes at a time when the stock has delivered strong longer term returns, with a 1 year return of 84.2% and a 3 year return of 157.2%. The current share price of $205.94 places the company in the spotlight, as it competes for enterprise and AI workloads where clear product positioning can influence large customer decisions.\nKelman's appointment indicates that AMD is putting more emphasis on how it presents its AI and data center strategy to customers, partners and the broader market. As the company refines its offerings in these areas, investors may pay close attention to how effectively AMD communicates its product roadmap and value proposition relative to well funded competitors.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Advanced Micro Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Advanced Micro Devices.\nDoes the team leading Advanced Micro Devices have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\nKelman’s arrival comes just days after AMD reported record Q4 2025 revenue of US$10.27b and net income of US$1.51b, with data center and AI products sitting at the center of the story. As AMD pushes to position itself as a credible alternative to Nvidia and Broadcom in AI infrastructure, the way it tells that story to cloud providers, enterprises and developers starts to matter almost as much as the silicon itself. Kelman’s background at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle is closely aligned with the customer set AMD is targeting, especially hyperscalers and large software vendors that buy at rack scale and care about full platform offerings rather than just chips. Reporting into Ruth Cotter and working closely with the wider executive team, he will shape brand, go to market and developer engagement at a time when AMD is guiding to Q1 2026 revenue of about US$9.8b and is rolling out new accelerator and server CPU generations. For you as an investor, this leadership change is less about a sudden shift in strategy and more about execution quality on AI and data center growth plans that are already in motion.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Kelman’s enterprise focused background supports the existing narrative that AMD is leaning into long term AI and data center demand, especially with large cloud and sovereign projects that value consistent messaging and ecosystem building.\nAt the same time, his appointment highlights execution risk that the narrative already flags, since winning share from Nvidia, Intel and custom in house chips depends not just on products but on how effectively AMD convinces hyperscalers and governments to commit to multi year deals.\nThe narrative focuses heavily on product roadmaps and long term revenue assumptions, but it does not fully account for how a revamped marketing engine could influence developer adoption, software ecosystem depth and customer mix over the next few years.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Advanced Micro Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Higher marketing and ecosystem spending, on top of already elevated AI related operating expenses, could weigh on near term margins if revenue growth from data center and AI deals does not keep pace.\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged customer concentration and inventory risks around AI hardware, and a stronger push into large accounts under Kelman increases exposure if a few big customers delay or scale back spending.\n🎁 A CMO with deep experience at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle could help AMD sharpen its pitch to enterprise buyers and developers, supporting the company’s aim to grow AI and data center revenue over time.\n🎁 Better alignment between product, marketing and developer relations may help AMD differentiate its accelerators and EPYC server chips versus Nvidia and Broadcom, supporting efforts to win rack scale and platform deals.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on whether AMD’s marketing shift shows up in concrete ways, such as deeper partnerships with major cloud providers, clearer software and developer tool messaging around its Instinct accelerators, and more consistent positioning of EPYC based platforms against Nvidia and custom chips. Commentary on earnings calls around customer engagement, funnel visibility and AI deal quality will be useful signals for how effectively Kelman and the broader team are executing. You can also track whether higher operating expenses tied to AI and marketing are matched by sustained progress in data center revenue and any changes in analyst sentiment on execution risk.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Advanced Micro Devices, head to the community page for Advanced Micro Devices to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Should You Forget Tesla and Buy These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the quintessential hypergrowth stock for much of the last decade or more. But recently, it has entered a period of stagnancy. Its overall revenues have been flat to down since the end of 2023, and its operating income has slumped by more than half in the last few years.\nGlobal unit sales volumes for its electric vehicles have stopped growing. At the same time, the company is trying to pivot its focus to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, but has struggled to gain much traction in either space. It may be many years before those new business lines have a true impact on Tesla's bottom line.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nWith this in mind -- and with Tesla's $1 trillion market cap as of this writing -- investors may be smart to avoid buying the stock right now. Here are two other potential millionaire-maker stocks you may want to consider adding to your portfolio instead.\nAn opportunity in global money transfers Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) has grown impressively over the last few years. Through its mobile application, lower fees, and a better customer experience than is offered by rival services, it has begun to gain market share within the remittance space, which covers international money transfers.\nLast quarter, its active customers grew 21% year over year to 8.9 million, revenue grew 25% to $420 million, and the business generated positive net income. Over the next few years, management expects total revenue to about double to $3 billion, with $600 million in adjusted EBTIDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). That level of expected earnings makes its current market cap of $2.85 billion look mighty cheap.\n\nSome investors may shy away from Remitly because of the apparent threat that stablecoins pose to its business model, as, in principle, these cryptocurrencies allow people to more easily send money across borders freely. However, this runs into a speed bump when you have to convert stablecoins into local currencies, a process that always incurs costs. Investors are also wary of how the immigration crackdown in the United States will impact the market for cross-border remittances. The numbers so far don't show that as a cause for concern, however: Remitly's 2025 financials show no impact from stricter U.S. border and immigration policies. Moreover, there are still millions of immigrants in countries around the world who want to send money back home to their families, and that is not going to change anytime soon.\n\nStory Continues\nGiven Remitly's market cap below $3 billion and its expectations to generate over $500 million in adjusted earnings a few years from now, investors would be smart to buy the stock today and hold it for the long haul. It might just make you a lot of money.\nA misunderstood entertainment giant Another stock with a better setup than Tesla at the moment is Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) . The entertainment company that has dominated family-friendly video games for decades just released a new device, the Nintendo Switch 2, that is selling faster than the original Switch did.\nTotal sales are up by close to 100% year over year through the first three quarters of its fiscal 2026, which ends in March. However, the stock is down due to rising computer chip prices and a lack of flagship video game titles for the Switch 2 so far.\n\nIt is unclear how long these high chip prices will last, but those make up only a small part of Nintendo's input costs, and they will eventually subside. On the games front, Nintendo is notoriously patient with its release schedule, but it has increased its total investment in game development in recent years, which will eventually lead to more flagship titles. There are likely more Mario , Animal Crossing , and Pokémon titles in development right now.\nOn top of games, Nintendo is releasing the sequel to its animated Mario Movie in April. The original did over $1 billion at the box office. Combined with its new theme parks around the world, Nintendo has many more ways to interact with its fans than it did a decade ago, which should lead to higher game sales and greater profits.\n\nToday, Nintendo's market cap is $62 billion, but because of the huge amount of cash on its balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is well below $50 billion. As the Switch 2's player base continues to grow, annual earnings should reach well over $5 billion, if not significantly higher, within a few years. This makes Nintendo stock a bargain buy for investors looking to capitalize on the growth of the Switch 2.\nShould you buy stock in Remitly Global right now? Before you buy stock in Remitly Global, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Remitly Global wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Could Be the Best-Performing AI Chip Stock of 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 2:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: LITE\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending is poised to jump significantly in 2026, with a recent report from CNBC suggesting that the capital expenditures (capex) of the top four hyperscalers in the U.S. could soar to $700 billion this year. That would be a big jump over 2025's capex of $394 billion.\n\nSemiconductor companies are likely to win big from this massive outlay , as they provide the basic building blocks that enable AI training and inference. Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) is among the semiconductor companies playing a central role in the proliferation of AI.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nShares of this company that sells optical and photonic networking components enabling high-speed transmission in AI data centers are already trading up 56% in 2026. It won't be surprising to see this stock delivering more gains this year, potentially becoming the best-performing AI chip stock of 2026.\nLet's see why that may be the case.\nLumentum is clocking stellar growth thanks to AI Lumentum released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the period ended Dec. 27, 2025) on Feb. 3. The company reported a 66% year-over-year increase in revenue to $666 million, well ahead of the $652 million Wall Street estimate. Even better, the company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped nearly 4x year over year to $1.67 per share, crushing the $1.41-per-share consensus expectation.\nCEO Michael Hurlston remarked on the latest earnings call that Lumentum is playing a critical role in AI data centers:\nImportantly, Lumentum expects to grow at a faster pace going forward, driven by its solid backlog, new contracts, and capacity expansion plans. The company has a backlog of more than $400 million for its optical circuit switches that enable high-speed transmission in data centers.\nMeanwhile, the company received what it calls an incremental \"multi-hundred-million-dollar\" contract in co-packaged optics, which are deployed in custom AI processors for their higher bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n\nLumentum has been aggressively expanding capacity to meet the terrific end-market demand. It already achieved more than half of the targeted 40% capacity improvement in the previous quarter. Moreover, Lumentum plans to bring new capacity online at two of its plants in the U.K. and Japan later this year.\n\nStory Continues\nAccelerating growth should lead to more upside Lumentum management anticipates an 85% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter to $805 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. Its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.25 per share is almost 4x the earnings it clocked in the same period last year.\nAnalysts expect a 263% spike in Lumentum's earnings in the current fiscal year to $7.47 per share, followed by impressive jumps over the next couple of years as well.\nThe company may deliver stronger growth as it brings more capacity online. That could pave the way for more upside in this technology stock, which is why investors can consider buying Lumentum before it jumps higher.\nShould you buy stock in Lumentum right now? Before you buy stock in Lumentum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lumentum wasn’t one of them.

For long-term investors, Bitcoin (BTC) remains a highly speculative and volatile asset facing significant selling pressure. In contrast, NVIDIA Corp. stands out as a stronger long-term investment thanks to its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects. Here&rsquo;s why &ndash;\nBitcoin Sinks as Crypto Winter Deepens Bitcoin&rsquo;s price has been declining steadily for some time, ushering in what many are calling a crypto winter. After reaching an all-time high of $127,000 in October last year, the digital asset dropped below $90,000 in December and then slipped under $80,000 in January. Following its most recent slide, Bitcoin is now down 22.9% year to date, trading around $67,000.\nSo, what triggered the downfall? Obviously, Bitcoin entered a correction after record highs, as selling pressure intensified and profit-taking weighed on the price. At the same time, institutional participation declined as interest in the so-called digital gold cooled, contributing to broader pessimism across the crypto market. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $3 billion in January this year, following withdrawals of $7 billion in November and $2 billion in December last year.\n\nGeopolitical tensions also pushed investors toward safe havens like gold and silver, while demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies softened, as they are generally viewed as riskier investments. Overall, sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, remains weak, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly in the &ldquo;extreme fear&rdquo; territory.\nNVIDIA Rides AI Boom as Revenues Soar on Easing Trade Woes NVIDIA is undoubtedly encountering stiff competition from rivals like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . as data center capital expenditure increases. Nevertheless, driven by the rapid rise of AI, NVIDIA continues to deliver impressive quarterly results. This sustained performance is largely due to the incessant demand for its cutting-edge chips, especially the latest Blackwell architecture, as well as the ever-increasing need for cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA expects global data center spending to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion annually by 2030, creating a significant opportunity for the company to expand sales of its computing hardware. U.S.-China trade complications have also settled somewhat, which is a positive development for NVIDIA. Chinese officials have approved the sale of H200 AI chips to select customers, including ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The Trump administration has already granted approval for these chips to be shipped to China.\n\nNVIDIA now anticipates fiscal fourth-quarter 2026 revenues of nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company&rsquo;s revenues surged 62% year over year and 22% quarter over quarter to $57 billion.\nBitcoin or NVIDIA: Which Is the Better Long-Term Bet? After its peak, Bitcoin&rsquo;s downfall has been fueled by profit-taking, reduced institutional interest, rising geopolitical tensions that pushed investors toward safer assets, and overall weak sentiment across the crypto market. For now, the market appears to be waiting for fresh catalysts to resume Bitcoin&rsquo;s momentum. However, one thing is clear: it is a highly speculative asset, and it faces massive selling pressure during periods of negative investor sentiment, making it less suitable for a long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, NVIDIA is a proven stock that has delivered consistent returns despite geopolitical challenges and intense competition. NVIDIA remains strongly positioned for future growth fueled by rising demand for its chips and a continued increase in data center spending. NVIDIA&rsquo;s net profit margin of 53% exceeds the industry's average of 50.1%, underscoring its strong growth and making it an attractive long-term buy (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\nNVIDIA, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "鉅亨投資雷達》勞退自提6%值得嗎？還是自己投資比較好？ 鉅亨買基金\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午10:56\n\n「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "MKS Dividend Hike Raises Questions On Debt Load And Cash Priorities\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 10:12 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MKSI\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nMKS (NasdaqGS:MKSI) announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend.\nThe new dividend level reflects a higher cash return to shareholders on a recurring basis.\nThe decision comes while the company is dealing with a high debt load and pressure on margins.\n\nMKS, listed on NasdaqGS:MKSI, supplies critical technologies to semiconductor and related electronics markets, areas that continue to attract attention from investors monitoring product cycles and capital spending trends. The 14% dividend hike is notable because it arrives during a period of financial and operational strain, with management opting to return more cash even as debt and margins remain key areas of focus.\nFor investors, this move raises practical questions about how MKS plans to balance cash returns with balance sheet priorities over time. The higher dividend may influence how some shareholders view capital allocation at MKS, particularly those weighing income needs against risks associated with leverage and profitability pressures.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for MKS by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on MKS.\nIs MKS's dividend sustainable? Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.\nThe 14% lift in MKS’s quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share points to management’s confidence in future cash generation, even as the company works through a sizeable debt load and margin pressure. Income-focused investors may see the higher regular cash return as a positive signal, but it also raises the bar for how consistently MKS needs to produce free cash flow. With interest costs already flagged as a risk and a high debt-to-equity position, the key question is whether the dividend and debt service can both be comfortably supported through a full semiconductor cycle.\n\nHow This Fits Into The MKS Narrative The dividend increase aligns with a narrative that leans on rising earnings power from AI-driven semiconductor demand and higher recurring revenues, suggesting management expects cash flows to support ongoing shareholder returns.\nAt the same time, using more cash for dividends could constrain flexibility to reduce leverage faster, which directly touches on the narrative risk around high debt and interest expense.\nThe recent refinancing and interest savings are not fully reflected in the narrative context, and these changes may influence how sustainable investors view the higher dividend over time.\n\nStory continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for MKS to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Analysts have highlighted that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, so a higher recurring dividend could tighten headroom if conditions weaken.\n⚠️ MKS already carries substantial debt, and allocating more cash to dividends rather than faster deleveraging may leave the company more exposed in a cyclical downturn.\n🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow at a strong rate, which, if achieved, could support both the higher dividend and ongoing debt reduction.\n🎁 Earnings recently grew at a very large rate, which may give management confidence that cash generation can support a higher payout to shareholders.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on how MKS balances its higher dividend with debt reduction and interest coverage. Updates on free cash flow, margin trends and progress on lowering interest expense will be important to judge whether the payout remains comfortable through different phases of the semiconductor cycle, especially against peers like Applied Materials, Lam Research and KLA. Any changes to the dividend policy or leverage targets, along with commentary on future cash priorities, will be useful markers for how management is weighing growth investment against shareholder returns.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for MKS, head to the community page for MKS to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "AMD Just Announced a Huge Turnaround. Is It a Buy?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has been a great stock to own since 2025. Its stock is up around 60% since then, outperforming Nvidia over the same time frame. Up until a few days ago, AMD's stock was up over 100% during the same time frame, but it cratered after the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nIf I presented you the numbers, you may question why the sell-off occurred in the first place, as it looks like AMD has started the turnaround it told investors about months ago. Is this your buying opportunity? Or should you stay patient for a deeper decline?\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAMD's data center sales are accelerating One thing that has held AMD back during the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is its lack of focus on AI. Unlike Nvidia, which gets around 90% of its revenue from data center sales, AMD is more evenly spread out. During Q4 2025, 52% of sales came from data center revenue, while 38% came from its client and gaming division, and another 9% came from its embedded process division (totals don't add up to 100% due to rounding errors). Because AMD isn't as leveraged to data center sales, it isn't participating as much during one of the biggest technological shifts we've ever seen with generative AI .\n\nHowever, AMD is starting to increase its data center growth rate.\nDuring Q4 2025, its data center revenue increased at a 39% year-over-year pace. That's solid acceleration from Q3 2025's 22% growth rate, and Q4 could be the quarter that we look back on as the turning point for AMD. However, this is a small growth rate compared to what management thinks it will get to. Furthermore, sales to China are starting to return now that the Trump administration is starting to allow exports there again. This will be a solid boost throughout 2026 and beyond.\nBack in November, AMD released five-year guidance regarding each of its business units. During that release, it told investors that they could expect a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the data center division and a 10% CAGR for the other two. Combined, that would lead to a 35% CAGR companywide through 2030. While AMD fell slightly short of those projections during Q4, it still did an excellent job and is showing greater progress toward meeting those goals.\n\nBut why did AMD's stock slip?\nAMD's stock was expensive entering the quarter Before the sell-off, AMD's stock was trading for nearly 40 times forward earnings; now it trades for about 31.\n\nStory Continues\nConsidering AMD's track record and relative growth rate, there was no reason for AMD's stock to be valued that high, so a pullback was due. Furthermore, rival Nvidia trades for just 24 times forward earnings despite a greater market share and a stronger growth rate. So, to call AMD's stock cheap here is a fallacy, in my opinion.\n\nStill, I think it could deliver strong growth moving forward, especially if its data center division's revenue growth accelerates toward that 60% growth figure management guided for last year. For 2026, Wall Street analysts expect 34% revenue growth, and in 2027, that figure rises to 37%. Both of those are in line with the 35% overall CAGR management expects to deliver, so the analyst community believes that AMD can deliver on its promise.\nI'm still more bullish on Nvidia than I am AMD, but I think AMD is a worthy buy at this point in time as an alternative pick in the AI space. The AI build-out is far from over, and AMD could still deliver impressive growth despite missing out on the initial stages.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Deepens AI Inference Push With Groq Deal And Rubin Platform\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\nMU\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nNvidia agreed to acquire Groq's AI inference chip assets for $20b, aiming to expand its position in AI deployment hardware.\nThe company introduced its new Rubin chip platform, designed around next generation memory technology for inference workloads.\nSamsung and Micron are set to supply HBM4 memory for Nvidia's new GPU platforms, signaling changes in its component supply chain.\nRecent U.S. policy signals on legacy AI chip exports to China may affect how Nvidia serves that market.\n\nNVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) enters this phase of product and deal news with a share price of $186.94 and a one year return of 38.2%. Over the past week, the stock is up 8.8%, while the year to date return sits at a 1.0% decline, reflecting some recent volatility.\nFor you as an investor, the Groq acquisition and Rubin launch are mainly about where Nvidia wants to compete as AI usage shifts toward real world applications. Memory partnerships and evolving China export rules add extra moving parts that could influence demand, pricing power, and how its product roadmap plays out, all of which are worth watching alongside the share price.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for NVIDIA by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on NVIDIA.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 4 things going right for NVIDIA that every investor should see.\nNvidia’s $20b move for Groq’s inference assets and the Rubin platform launch point to a clear push beyond training GPUs into AI-inference specific hardware. That fits with what you are seeing elsewhere in the business, from distributed inference trials with Prologis and EPRI at utility-adjacent micro data centers to heavier use of Nvidia’s Isaac and BioNeMo platforms in areas like warehouse autonomy and lab robotics. The announced use of Samsung and Micron HBM4 on upcoming GPUs ties Nvidia more tightly to key memory suppliers, which may help support Rubin and Vera Rubin ramps but could also concentrate supplier risk. On the policy side, signals that older Hopper-generation chips might see looser export treatment to China, while newer architectures stay tightly controlled, effectively segment Nvidia’s portfolio by region and performance tier. For you, the thread across these developments is that Nvidia is working to secure more of the inference stack, from edge sites to large AI factories, while juggling supply chain depth and export rules that can affect where and how quickly new products scale.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The NVIDIA Narrative The Groq acquisition, Rubin platform work and distributed inference partnerships support the narrative that Nvidia is leaning into an AI infrastructure supercycle that spans both training and inference across data centers and edge locations.\nGreater reliance on specific HBM4 suppliers and export segmentation between Blackwell or Rubin and older Hopper chips underscores narrative risks around supply chain fragility and geopolitical limits on total addressable market.\nThe focus on inference specific hardware and micro data centers, as well as physical AI in labs and factories, extends the story into use cases that are not fully captured by a training centric view of AI data center growth.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NVIDIA to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Tighter links to a handful of HBM4 suppliers may expose Nvidia to component shortages or pricing pressure if memory capacity becomes constrained or terms change.\n⚠️ Export rules that keep the latest Blackwell and Rubin chips out of China could cap growth in that market and push some large customers toward domestic or alternative accelerators from peers like AMD or in house silicon.\n🎁 The Groq asset purchase and Rubin inference focus give Nvidia more product depth against inference competitors such as AMD and custom ASIC providers, which can help support its position across the AI stack.\n🎁 Memory partnerships with Samsung and Micron, plus work on distributed inference sites, can help Nvidia stay aligned with where AI workloads are heading, from large training clusters to latency sensitive edge deployments.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, it is worth watching how quickly Nvidia integrates Groq’s technology into shipping inference products and whether Rubin based systems gain traction with cloud providers and large enterprises. The terms and volumes associated with Samsung and Micron HBM4 supply will be important signals for how smoothly future GPU ramps can proceed. On the policy side, any concrete rules around legacy Hopper exports to China, compared with continuing restrictions on newer architectures, will help clarify how much of Nvidia’s portfolio can serve that market. Together, these factors will influence how balanced Nvidia’s AI exposure is between training and inference, and how diversified its demand and supply chains remain.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NVIDIA, head to the community page for NVIDIA to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co., while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\nThe heavy presence in Asia of advanced chip manufacturers, semiconductor foundries and assemblers, which are crucial to the AI infrastructure, is a key reason behind the region’s resilience during the recent rout on Wall Street. Micron Technology Inc.’s latest comments on memory chip supply tightness and Nvidia Corp.’s on sustainable spending have reinforced such a perception.\n\nIn a sign of growing foreign demand, Samsung Electronics saw its biggest overseas buying Thursday, sending its shares up 6.4%. They rose again on Friday. Meanwhile, global investors also notched their third-largest weekly purchase in Taiwanese stocks in a holiday-shortened week.\nKioxia Holdings Corp.’s shares surged 15% on Friday after soaring AI demand helped the Japanese memory chipmaker deliver a better-than-anticipated results outlook.\nThat’s as the Nasdaq 100 Index fell 4.6% and shed about $1.5 trillion in market value over the past 10 sessions, hit by a selloff in software names and other stocks deemed at risk from new AI tools.\n\nStory Continues\n“Some of the scares in the US are also good news in Asia, particularly when thinking about what infrastructure is really needed to harness agentic AI,” Stephanie Aliaga, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “What markets are really beginning to price in is this ChatGPT moment for AI agents.”\n\nMajor Asian chipmakers’ outsize weighting in local equities markets further amplifies their impact on stock moves.\nTSMC alone is approaching a weighting of 45% in the island’s benchmark Taiex index, three times its level a decade ago. South Korea’s Kospi has become a near duopoly, with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix Inc. together making up nearly 40%.\nWhile the so-called AI Scare Trade has also hurt US real estate services stocks and insurance brokers, there was less damage in Asia due to some of the local companies’ weaker response to cutting-edge technologies.\nThe Topix insurance sub-index has risen 6.2% since Feb. 3, with its real estate counterpart surging 15%.\n“Old school wins the day so far,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. “It’s protecting them from the AI disruption selloff because these industries are more entrenched in Japan and less open to disruption so far.”\nAs a result, the correlations between Asian and US equities based on weekly returns have slid to 0.43, the weakest level since June 2022, Bloomberg-compiled data show.\nTo be sure, Asia wasn’t entirely insulated from the global turmoil. Despite accounting for a small portion of the region’s stock markets, shares of software firms including Hong Kong-listed Kingdee International Software Group Co. and Indian tech services companies including Infosys Ltd. slumped along with their US peers during the recent sell-off.\n\nBut for now, Asian stocks are expected to continue their outperformance, thanks to the local companies’ different roles in the AI ecosystem, cheaper valuations and stronger earnings growth.\n“What we are investing in are the AI enablers such as chip manufacturers,” said Elfreda Jonker, client portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management. “One of our big positions is TSMC, which we continue to like.

Meanwhile, global investors also notched their third-largest weekly purchase in Taiwanese stocks in a holiday-shortened week.\nKioxia Holdings Corp.’s shares surged 15% on Friday after soaring AI demand helped the Japanese memory chipmaker deliver a better-than-anticipated results outlook.\nThat’s as the Nasdaq 100 Index fell 4.6% and shed about $1.5 trillion in market value over the past 10 sessions, hit by a selloff in software names and other stocks deemed at risk from new AI tools.\n\nStory Continues\n“Some of the scares in the US are also good news in Asia, particularly when thinking about what infrastructure is really needed to harness agentic AI,” Stephanie Aliaga, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “What markets are really beginning to price in is this ChatGPT moment for AI agents.”\n\nMajor Asian chipmakers’ outsize weighting in local equities markets further amplifies their impact on stock moves.\nTSMC alone is approaching a weighting of 45% in the island’s benchmark Taiex index, three times its level a decade ago. South Korea’s Kospi has become a near duopoly, with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix Inc. together making up nearly 40%.\nWhile the so-called AI Scare Trade has also hurt US real estate services stocks and insurance brokers, there was less damage in Asia due to some of the local companies’ weaker response to cutting-edge technologies.\nThe Topix insurance sub-index has risen 6.2% since Feb. 3, with its real estate counterpart surging 15%.\n“Old school wins the day so far,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. “It’s protecting them from the AI disruption selloff because these industries are more entrenched in Japan and less open to disruption so far.”\nAs a result, the correlations between Asian and US equities based on weekly returns have slid to 0.43, the weakest level since June 2022, Bloomberg-compiled data show.\nTo be sure, Asia wasn’t entirely insulated from the global turmoil. Despite accounting for a small portion of the region’s stock markets, shares of software firms including Hong Kong-listed Kingdee International Software Group Co. and Indian tech services companies including Infosys Ltd. slumped along with their US peers during the recent sell-off.\n\nBut for now, Asian stocks are expected to continue their outperformance, thanks to the local companies’ different roles in the AI ecosystem, cheaper valuations and stronger earnings growth.\n“What we are investing in are the AI enablers such as chip manufacturers,” said Elfreda Jonker, client portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management. “One of our big positions is TSMC, which we continue to like. All AI roads lead to TSMC.”\n--With assistance from Masaki Kondo, Gabrielle Ng and Anthony Stephens.\n(Updates with Kioxia earnings in 7th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

      "Content": "US, Taiwan finalise deal to cut tariffs, boost purchases of US goods\n\nBy David Lawder\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:54 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CL=F\n\nTSM\n\nBy David Lawder\nWASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Trump administration officials signed a final reciprocal trade agreement that confirmed a 15% U.S. tariff rate for imports from Taiwan, while committing Taiwan to a schedule for eliminating or lowering tariffs ‌on nearly all U.S. goods.\nThe document released by the U.S. Trade Representative's office on Thursday also commits Taiwan to ‌significantly boost purchases of U.S. goods from 2025 through 2029, including $44.4 billion of liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $15.2 billion of civil aircraft and engines, $25.2 billion of ​power grid equipment and generators, marine and steelmaking equipment.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nWhat investments did Taiwan commit to U.S. manufacturing?\n\nHow much will Taiwan purchase in U.S. goods?\n\nWhat tariff rates did the U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement establish?\n\nHow will this agreement affect U.S.-Taiwan trade deficit?\n\nThe agreement adds technical language and specific details to a trade framework deal first reached in January that cut tariffs on Taiwanese goods, including from its powerhouse semiconductor industries, to 15% from the 20% initially imposed by Trump. That puts Taiwan on an equal footing with its closest Asian export competitors, South Korea and Japan.\n\"This is a pivotal moment for Taiwan's ‌economy and industries to ride the winds of ⁠change and undergo a major transformation,\" Taiwan President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page.\nIt will optimize the Taiwan–U.S. economic and trade framework, build trustworthy industrial supply chains and establish a Taiwan–U.S. high-tech strategic ⁠partnership, he added.\nTaiwan also won exemptions from reciprocal tariffs for more than 2,000 product items exported to the United States, meaning the average tariff on U.S. exports will drop to 12.33%, Lai said.\n\nThe deal will need approval by Taiwan's parliament, where the opposition has a majority.\nINVESTMENT PLEDGE\nThe January ​agreement ​included a pledge by Taiwan that its companies would invest $250 billion to ​boost production of semiconductors, energy and artificial intelligence in ‌the U.S., including $100 billion already committed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. The Taiwan government would guarantee another $250 billion in U.S. investments, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\nThe final language did not provide further details on those investments, but said Taiwan's representative office in the U.S. would collaborate with U.S. authorities to facilitate additional new greenfield and brownfield investments \"in strategic high-technology manufacturing sectors, including AI, semiconductors, and advanced electronics.\"\nThe deal will immediately eliminate Taiwan's tariffs of up to 26% on many U.S. agricultural imports, including beef, dairy and corn. But ‌some tariffs, including the current 40% tariff on pork belly and 32% on ​ham, will only fall to 10%, according to the tariff schedule.\n\nStory Continues\nThe U.S. said ​under the deal, Taiwan will remove non-tariff barriers on ​motor vehicles and accept U.S. auto safety standards as well as those on medical devices and pharmaceuticals.\nU.S. ‌Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement that the ​agreement will boost export opportunities ​for U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen, workers, and manufacturers.\n\n\"This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,\" Greer added.\nFor the first 11 months ​of 2025, the U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan ‌ballooned to $126.9 billion from $73.7 billion for all of 2024, largely due to the large increase in imports of high-end ​AI chips from Taiwan, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard ​in Taipei; Editing by Anna Driver, Jamie Freed and Stephen Coates)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nQualcomm Qualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\nRemitly PayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nStory Continues\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\nThe Trade Desk Finally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The latest quarter’s move back into profitability and strong Q3 guidance appear to reinforce the near term AI demand catalyst, but also sharpen the main risk: heavy reliance on a few large cloud customers and the execution challenge of expanding capacity without eroding margins.\nThe most relevant recent announcement is Lumentum’s guidance for third quarter fiscal 2026 net revenue of US$780 million to US$830 million, which follows a quarter of sharply higher sales and a return to positive earnings. This outlook ties directly to AI driven orders in optical circuit switches and co packaged optics, and it sits at the center of the current debate about whether today’s AI backlog represents a sustainable multi year growth driver or a shorter lived spike in demand.\n\nYet beneath the strong guidance, investors should be aware that concentration in a handful of hyperscale customers still leaves Lumentum exposed if...\nRead the full narrative on Lumentum Holdings (it's free!)\nLumentum Holdings' narrative projects $3.1 billion revenue and $389.1 million earnings by 2028. This requires 23.4% yearly revenue growth and a $363.2 million earnings increase from $25.9 million today.\nUncover how Lumentum Holdings' forecasts yield a $348.38 fair value , a 40% downside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the most cautious analysts were assuming about US$2.7 billion of revenue and US$275.8 million of earnings by 2028, so compared with your focus on customer concentration risk, their narrative leans much more pessimistic about how easily today’s AI optics excitement could cool, and this latest earnings surprise may well prompt them to revisit those assumptions.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 12 other fair value estimates on Lumentum Holdings - why the stock might be worth less than half the current price!\nBuild Your Own Lumentum Holdings Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

And despite its recent highs, the stock is still not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and just over 7.5 times fiscal 2027 estimates.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nSandisk's performance is no flash in the pan The company is a leading producer of NAND storage devices, or flash memory. It is one of the few pure-play ways to invest in this segment of the tech market after the company was spun off from Western Digital about a year ago. NAND has been a very cyclical market over the years, but the space looks like it is at the beginning of what appears to be a long-lasting supercycle.\nIt was only a few years ago that the NAND market was in complete disarray. After seeing huge demand for electronics stemming from the pandemic, memory makers overbuilt production, causing a huge oversupply in the market that led prices to crash. Things became so bad that NAND gross margins turned negative.\n\nThis disarray led many memory makers to hugely cut NAND production and redirect their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory). At the same time, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized form of DRAM, began to take off because of its importance in helping optimize the performance of graphics processing units when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. HBM comes with strong unit economics, but it needs huge wafer capacity, so it began eating up memory maker resources.\nRising prices add another tailwind for Sandisk Soon after, AI data centers also started to need huge, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use NAND to help store training data. With production slashed and demand now suddenly surging, flash memory prices have been skyrocketing because there is now a huge NAND shortage. Given the economics and demand for HBM, along with growing demand for NAND, these market dynamics are unlikely to shift anytime in the near future.\nWith flash memory in short supply, Sandisk continues to benefit from increased prices, which are also dramatically lifting its gross margins and profits. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 61%, while its gross margins expanded from 32.3% a year ago to 50.9%, leading its adjusted earnings per share to surge fivefold.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the NAND market going from a cyclical business to a structural growth story on the back of AI data centers, Sandisk finds itself in an enviable position. And with the boom in AI infrastructure spending, the company is set to see huge growth ahead. This makes the recent dip a buying opportunity.\n\nShould you buy stock in Sandisk right now? Before you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Atomera Q4 Earnings Call Highlights\n\nMarketBeat\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 4:27 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ATOM\n\nTSM\n\nSSNLF\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points MST shows definitive proof for Gate-All-Around (GAA): Atomera reported successful deposition into nanosheet structures and superior diffusion-blocking at ~2nm versus silicon-arsenic, and has a strategic partnership with a large equipment OEM while targeting major foundries (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, Rapidus) with potential commercial deals in 2026.\nBroad application progress across multiple markets: Atomera is advancing wafer-based MST efforts in DRAM (promising preliminary wafer results that could lead to a JDA and production license), RF SOI, power (trench FET simulations suggesting >40% performance gains), and GaN, where its first commercial customer has begun running MST GaN-on-silicon wafers.\nWeak near-term financials and limited cash runway: 2025 revenue was only $65,000 with a GAAP net loss of $20.2M and cash down to $19.2M after ATM sales (≈$7.6M in 2025 and an additional ~$3.2M post-year-end); Q1 revenue is expected at $50k–$100k and 2026 non-GAAP operating expense is targeted at about $18.5M.\nInterested in Atomera Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAtomera (NASDAQ:ATOM) used its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 update call to outline recent technical progress across several semiconductor markets, with management repeatedly framing 2025 as a setup year for commercial execution and potential deal announcements later in 2026.\nGate-All-Around results lift confidence in adoption timeline CEO Scott Bibaud spent much of his prepared remarks and Q&A emphasizing progress in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor technology, which he described as foundational for AI-related chips such as GPUs, CPUs, and advanced networking components. Atomera recently announced a strategic partnership with a “large equipment OEM,” and Bibaud said the target customers for GAA adoption include TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Japan’s Rapidus.\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\nBibaud said Atomera’s MST technology is positioned as a diffusion-blocking solution for high phosphorus doping levels in GAA source and drain regions. He said a key manufacturing challenge is preventing phosphorus dopants from migrating into the channel, which can significantly impact performance, efficiency, and yield.\n\nAccording to Bibaud, Atomera’s target customers wanted two proof points for manufacturability at around 2 nanometers:\nThat MST can be deposited effectively into nanosheet structures.\nThat MST’s diffusion-blocking characteristics outperform other industry approaches.\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nStory Continues\nBibaud said the company obtained “very exciting silicon results” in both areas in the prior month and believes these results provide “definitive proof” to drive broader adoption in the future. He added that MST can be deposited using existing tools and standard gases and described it as “far superior” to current diffusion blocking materials used by the industry.\n\nIn response to analyst Richard Shannon of Craig-Hallum, Bibaud said the company’s increased confidence is tied to having recent test data that addresses the customer concerns around both deposition into very small structures and diffusion blocking efficacy in those structures. He said Atomera has been working with one GAA customer to access the necessary wafers and structures, and he expressed a goal of expanding engagement to all four major GAA customers.\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\nWhen asked about alternatives, Bibaud pointed to silicon arsenic as a prior industry approach, calling it more of a spacer than an effective diffusion blocker. He said Atomera has tested MST against silicon arsenic and found “vastly better” diffusion blocking performance. He also said the industry prefers to avoid arsenic when possible because it is “expensive to use and dangerous.”\n\nUpdates across DRAM, RF SOI, power, and GaN Beyond GAA, management discussed multiple application areas where Atomera is pursuing what it calls “wafer-based” solutions—an approach Bibaud said can reduce integration engineering complexity by placing MST on a blank wafer before the customer begins the rest of its manufacturing process.\nDRAM: Bibaud said DRAM architectures are reaching an inflection point as the industry increases use of the vertical dimension. Atomera is working on offerings aimed at next-generation DRAM architectures, alongside solutions for products currently in production. He cited two “major solution offerings” with high market potential that are wafer-based and therefore “easier to adopt and test.” Bibaud said Atomera is conducting many wafer runs, mostly processing through customer fabs. One customer has preliminary results that “look promising,” with final data expected in about a month; if results are positive, Bibaud said Atomera would push for a joint development agreement and a production license.\n\nRF SOI: Bibaud said Atomera’s RF SOI solution can improve multiple areas, including RF switches and low noise amplifiers (LNA). He said the company is working with “many of the key players” and hopes to drive broad adoption. He also said customers could deposit MST themselves on wafers or potentially source RF SOI MST wafers from third-party suppliers, with Atomera’s license structure supporting both models.\nPower: Bibaud said Atomera continues to work with ST on MST solutions across multiple business units despite a prior-year setback. He also said there has been inbound interest for additional power applications. He highlighted internal analysis suggesting MST could improve trench FET performance by more than 40% in simulations, describing trench FETs as important for energy efficiency in AI data centers. Bibaud said a customer was already interested in beginning development based on the post-Christmas simulation result. He also discussed MSTcad simulations showing MST can improve HBT devices used in RF communication systems and said discussions were underway with a potential first customer.\n\nIn Q&A, Bibaud described power as a larger and more diverse market than RF SOI and said Atomera is expanding engagement but is not working with “the vast majority” of power players.\nGaN: Bibaud said Atomera’s first commercial customer has begun running wafers for GaN-on-silicon with MST. He said this customer can both grow GaN wafers and manufacture electrical devices, which could allow it to move faster than Atomera’s internal development work with Sandia National Labs and Texas State. He added the customer is exploring GaN in both RF and power technologies.\nBibaud also noted Atomera’s GaN-on-silicon concept paper was approved to move to the proposal stage for a PowerAmerica project aimed at advancing wide bandgap materials. He said the company had received letters of support from multiple future customers and framed the effort as its first attempt to secure outside development funding, describing the initial funding sought as “modest” but potentially opening pathways for future funding opportunities.\n\nFinancial results: modest revenue, continued losses, cash decline CFO Frank Laurencio said 2025 revenue was $65,000, consisting of NRE fees for wafer deliveries and MSTcad licensing. GAAP net loss for 2025 was $20.2 million, or $0.65 per share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $18.4 million, or $0.68 per share, in 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, 2025 net loss was $16.1 million, or $0.52 per share, versus $15.4 million, or $0.57 per share, in 2024.\nGAAP operating expenses were $20.9 million in 2025, up about $1.5 million from $19.3 million in 2024, driven mainly by a $1.1 million increase in stock compensation tied to changes in executive equity-based compensation. Laurencio said Atomera implemented performance stock units (PSUs) in Q1 2025 that vest based on stock price performance versus the Russell 2000 Index.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses were $15.9 million in 2025, up $429,000 from 2024. Laurencio said R&D expenses rose to $10.2 million from $9.4 million, primarily due to increased outsourced engineering as Atomera used new device fabrication vendors, replacing TSI Semiconductors. He said GaN expenses fell to $4.8 million from $5.1 million, mainly due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by higher professional fees.\nCash usage, ATM activity, and near-term revenue outlook Atomera ended 2025 with $19.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, down from $26.7 million at the end of 2024. Laurencio said the company used $14.9 million in cash from operating activities during 2025, including $3.2 million in Q4.\nDuring 2025, Atomera sold about 1.6 million shares through its at-the-market (ATM) facility at an average price of $5.15 per share, generating net proceeds of about $7.6 million after costs. The company ended the year with 32.4 million shares outstanding. After year-end, Laurencio said Atomera raised an additional $3.2 million in net proceeds by selling about 1.3 million shares at an average price of $2.47.\n\nFor Q1, Laurencio said Atomera expects to recognize revenue in the range of $50,000 to $100,000 from shipment of MST wafers to customers, and reiterated the company does not provide revenue guidance beyond the current quarter.\nLooking to 2026, Laurencio said Atomera intends to control costs while investing in areas tied to revenue and near-term commercial progress, including adding a head of marketing following the hiring of a VP of sales in October. The company expects non-GAAP operating expense of approximately $18.5 million in 2026, though Laurencio said the year-over-year comparison is affected by the potential payout and accrual timing of executive bonuses that were withheld in 2025.\nIn closing comments, Bibaud said the “entire focus” of Atomera’s efforts is reaching commercial agreements and that the company believes its 2025 work has positioned it to close opportunities, with updates expected as the year progresses.\n\nAbout Atomera (NASDAQ:ATOM) Atomera Inc is a materials engineering company that develops and licenses advanced thin film technologies for the semiconductor industry.

      "Content": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nGeoffrey Seiler\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:57 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market is continuing to boom, and this is still a great place to look to invest. Let's look at two AI stocks that investors can buy now and hold for the next decade.\nundefined\nBroadcom One of the most exciting AI stocks to own right now for the long term is undoubtedly Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The AI infrastructure market is booming with no signs of let-up in sight. At the same time, data center networking is becoming more important as AI chip clusters grow, while there has also been a shift toward companies looking to create their own custom AI chips to save costs.\nAs the inference market eventually outpaces training over the coming decade, AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) should begin to take more share away from graphics processing units (GPUs ), which are currently the primary chips used to power AI workloads.\n\nThis is all great news for Broadcom. The company is a top player in data center networking, where its Tomahawk Ethernet switch is a leading solution within AI data centers. Meanwhile, the company helped Alphabet create its highly successful tensor processing units (TPUs), which look poised to become a huge growth driver as Alphabet aggressively builds out its AI infrastructure and starts letting customers use its chips for their AI workloads, as well. Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion TPU order to be delivered this year for use within Google Cloud. Meanwhile, other companies, including OpenAI, are also working with Broadcom to develop their own custom AI chips.\nBetween networking and custom AI chips, Broadcom has one of the biggest growth opportunities in the AI space over the next decade.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another huge beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company is the leading manufacturer of chips in the world, and it has a near monopoly on making advanced chips. As competitors have struggled with achieving high yields for advanced chips, TSMC has become the go-to partner for chip designers and is working in lock step with them to increase capacity to meet surging demand. Best of all, it benefits from both GPU and AI ASIC growth.\nTSMC's position in the industry has also given it strong pricing power, which has helped it boost its gross margins. According to reports, it has already informed customers of a four-year price hike schedule. Between boosting its capacity and price increase, TSMC looks poised to be a long-term winner in the AI infrastructure space.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "$10 Million Exit: Why a Fund Would Walk Away From CoreCivic Despite a $604 Million Quarter\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:36 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CXW\n\nGOOG\n\nTSEM\n\nCLF\n\n^GSPC\n\nTuriya Advisors Asia Ltd sold its entire position in CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) during the fourth quarter, according to a February 11 SEC filing, with an estimated transaction value of $9.75 million.\nWhat happened According to an SEC filing dated February 11, Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd reported selling all 479,000 shares of CoreCivic in the fourth quarter. The estimated transaction value was $9.75 million.\nWhat else to know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:GOOGL: $225.77 million (34.6% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:TSEM: $172.85 million (26.5% of AUM)\nNYSE:CLF: $96.28 million (14.7% of AUM)\nNYSE:GEO: $91.00 million (13.9% of AUM)\nNYSE:PSTG: $67.01 million (10.3% of AUM)\nAs of February 11, shares of CoreCivic were priced at $18.50, up 2.5% over the past year and underperforming the S&P 500 by 11.8 percentage points.\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close February 11, 2026)\n$18.50\nMarket capitalization\n$1.98 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$2.09 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$109.24 million\n\nCompany snapshot CoreCivic, Inc. operates correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, and provides government real estate solutions across the United States.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through long-term contracts with government agencies for facility management, rehabilitation programs, and property leasing.\nIts main customers are federal, state, and local government entities seeking corrections, detention, and reentry services.\nCoreCivic, Inc. is a leading U.S. provider of partnership correctional and detention management services, with a diversified portfolio spanning safety, community reentry, and real estate segments. The company leverages its scale and experience to deliver secure facility operations and rehabilitation programs for government partners. Its integrated service offerings and long-term contracts support stable cash flows and position CoreCivic as a key player in the specialty REIT sector.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors When a concentrated portfolio reallocates capital away from a government services operator that just posted $604.0 million in quarterly revenue and $26.5 million in fourth quarter net income, it likely signals positioning, not necessarily pessimism.\n\nCoreCivic grew full-year 2025 revenue to $2.2 billion and net income to $116.5 million, with normalized funds from operations per diluted share of $2.05. Management expects 2026 net income between $147.5 million and $157.5 million and EBITDA as high as $445.0 million. That is not a business in retreat.\n\nFor a portfolio already heavily weighted toward cyclical and policy-sensitive names like Cleveland-Cliffs and GEO Group, trimming or exiting another corrections exposure may simply reduce thematic overlap or open up opportunities for targeted bets in other names. CoreCivic’s leverage of 2.8 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and expanding credit facility provide flexibility, but the stock still carries headline and regulatory risk.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in CoreCivic right now? Before you buy stock in CoreCivic, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CoreCivic wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Morgan Stanley tweaks Micron stock price target as pressure builds\n\nMoz Farooque\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nSSNLF\n\nMicron ( MU ) stock just got another major nod of approval from Wall Street , and the timing is telling.\nShares of the popular memory maker are up 10% over the past week, and Morgan Stanley sees even more upside, raising its price target to $450 from $350 while reiterating an overweight rating.\nThe bullishness stems from the fact that memory pricing power continues to go from strength to strength.\n\nMicron and other memory makers have been on a killer run as AI infrastructure spending rises at an exponential pace. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) has become mission-critical for AI accelerators, and supply has struggled to keep pace.\nMicron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra discussed AI’s insatiable demand for memory during a recent CNBC interview at Davos.\nAnd AI’s relentless appetite for memory isn’t slowing down anytime soon, per Seeking Alpha and according to Samsung Electronics CTO Song Jai-hyuk .\nSpeaking at Semicon Korea 2026, he said that AI-linked infrastructure demand should remain strong through at least 2027, with the tech titan ramping up mass production of its sixth-generation HBM4 chips.\n“ Memory and packaging are no longer supporting roles ,” said Clark Tseng of Semi, a semiconductor research and analysis outfit. “They are now critical to how fast AI infrastructure can scale .”\n\nAdditionally, Lenovo said memory costs jumped 40% to 50% in the past quarter and could double in the current one.\nThat’s exactly the setup that’s pushing Micron stock to record highs, up 44% year to date , despite broader market sluggishness.\nThe ongoing AI infrastructure buildout is expanding rapidly, positioning Micron well for the remainder of the year.\nWhere Wall Street sees Micron stock heading next Micron is trading at $410.34 (as of Feb. 12, 2026).\nMorgan Stanley: $450 (+9.7%) UBS: $450 (+9.7%) Deutsche Bank: $500 (+21.9%) Wells Fargo: $410 (-0.1%) Citigroup: $385 (-6.2%)\nMorgan Stanley sees pricing power getting stronger, not weaker Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore is making the case that, despite the eye-opening run in DRAM over the past year, the cycle is only tightening.\n“As much as happened in the last 12 months in DRAM, we remain excited for what's ahead,” he wrote. The key element to consider at this point is supply, or rather, the lack of it.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nThe numbers back up the bullishness:\nDDR5 spot pricing up 30% YTD\nSpot prices are 130% above January contract levels (up 86% from December).\nMainstream pricing could double again while still sitting at more than 10% below spot.\nASPs could approach the high-teens per GB.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s tremendous pricing leverage.\nMoreover, Moore now expects Micron to earn as much as $52 per share in 2026 , speahreaded by HBM demand tied to Nvidia . “ HBM is certainly a key part of the story here ,” he noted, but added that DDR5 pricing alone is now “ a much more attractive market right now .”\nMicron is smaller in HBM, but the gap is narrowing AI accelerators have been gobbling up HBM, and businesses that can efficiently ship product at scale continue to win over investor confidence.\nAt this point, though, the scoreboard in the memory space is clear.\nIn DRAM, SK hynix leads the charge with 33.2% market share , followed by Samsung at 32.6% , with Micron at 25.7% .\nIn HBM, which is the critical part for AI GPUs, the gap is wider.\nRelated: Top analyst revamps Apple stock price target\nSK hynix currently dominates with a 53% market share , Samsung holds 35% , and Micron trails at 11% .\n\nIn NAND, Samsung leads at 32.3% , SK hynix follows at 19.3% .\nSo clearly, SK hynix is the stand-out company that’s dominating the HBM scene and will likely capture the bulk of Nvidia’s early Rubin volume. Also, Samsung is moving aggressively to ramp HBM4 shipments and close the gap.\nAt the same time, despite Micron being a much smaller player in HBM, it’s ramping HBM4 and benefiting from the broader memory crunch.\nIt’s important to note that Micron is already in high-volume production on HBM4, having sold out its 2026 supply.\nMicron stock crushes the S&P 500 across every major time frame YTD: Micron +43.77% versus S&P 500 +1.40%\n1-year: Micron +336.16% versus S&P 500 +14.38%\n3-year: Micron +585.96% versus S&P 500 +69.70%\n5-year: Micron +374.49% versus S&P 500 +77.24%\n10-year: Micron +4,134.67% versus S&P 500 +279.50%\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nRelated: JPMorgan doubles down on S&P 500 target for one key reason\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 12, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late To Consider Sandisk (SNDK) After Its Surging 2024 Share Price?\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:15 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SNDK\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nIf you are wondering whether Sandisk’s current share price lines up with its underlying worth, this article walks through what the numbers say about value.\nThe stock last closed at US$630.29, with returns of 9.4% over 7 days, 61.7% over 30 days and 129.0% year to date, while the 1-year return is very large.\nRecent headlines around Sandisk have focused on its role in storage technology and broader interest in tech names, giving extra attention to a stock that has already moved sharply. This context matters for anyone trying to understand whether the current price reflects fundamentals or more sentiment-driven trading.\nRight now, Sandisk scores 2 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by its valuation score . We will look at what different valuation approaches suggest and then finish with a simple way to bring this into one clearer view of value.\n\nSandisk scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Sandisk Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model looks at the cash Sandisk is expected to generate in the future and then discounts those projected cash flows back to today to estimate what the business might be worth right now.\nFor Sandisk, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $1.41b. Analysts and Simply Wall St then project cash flows out over the next decade using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with analyst estimates feeding into the earlier years and extrapolated figures used for the later period. For example, projected Free Cash Flow for 2028 is $11.98b, and the discounted values for the 2026 to 2035 stream of cash flows range from roughly $4.71b to $10.39b per year in present value terms.\n\nPulling those together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2,008.01 per share. Against the recent share price of US$630.29, this implies Sandisk trades at about a 68.6% discount. On these assumptions, the DCF view indicates that the stock is materially undervalued.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Sandisk is undervalued by 68.6%.

It sidesteps short term earnings swings and puts the spotlight on the top line.\n\nStory Continues\nIn general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/S multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more conservative range. So the key question is not just whether a multiple is high or low, but whether it fits the company’s profile.\nSandisk currently trades on a P/S ratio of 10.42x, which is well above the Tech industry average of 2.00x and above the peer group average of 4.98x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Sandisk is 8.80x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/S might be, given factors like Sandisk’s earnings, profit margins, risk profile, industry and market cap. Because it blends these company specific drivers, it can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry.\nComparing the current 10.42x P/S to the 8.80x Fair Ratio suggests Sandisk is trading above this fair value range.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

      "Content": "This $96 Million Steel Bet Signals Conviction in Cleveland-Cliffs Despite a $1.4 Billion Annual Loss\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:07 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CLF\n\nGOOG\n\nTSEM\n\nGEO\n\nPSTG\n\nTuriya Advisors Asia Ltd initiated a new position in Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) during the fourth quarter, acquiring 7,250,000 shares in a trade estimated at $96.28 million, according to a February 11 SEC filing.\nWhat happened According to an SEC filing dated February 11, Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd established a new position in Cleveland-Cliffs by purchasing 7,250,000 shares. The fund’s quarter-end stake was valued at $96.28 million.\nWhat else to know This was a new position, now comprising 14.75% of Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd’s 13F reportable assets under management as of December 31.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: GOOGL: $225.77 million (34.6% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSEM: $172.85 million (26.5% of AUM)\nNYSE: CLF: $96.28 million (14.8% of AUM)\nNYSE: GEO: $91.00 million (13.9% of AUM)\nNYSE: PSTG: $67.01 million (10.3% of AUM)\nAs of February 11, shares of Cleveland-Cliffs were priced at $12.48, up 10.4% over the prior year.\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 2/11/26)\n$12.48\nMarket Capitalization\n$7.12 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$18.61 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n($1.48 billion)\n\nCompany snapshot Cleveland-Cliffs produces flat-rolled steel, stainless steel, electrical steel, tinplate, tubular components, and hot-briquetted iron.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of steel products and value-added steel solutions for various industrial applications.\nIts main customers include automotive manufacturers, infrastructure and manufacturing firms, distributors, converters, and other steel producers across North America.\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc. is a leading North American steel producer with a vertically integrated business model, leveraging both steelmaking and iron ore mining assets. The company serves a diversified customer base, with significant exposure to the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Its scale, product breadth, and control over raw materials position it as a key supplier in the regional steel industry.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors This move creates a $96.28 million position that now accounts for 14.75% of reported assets, instantly making steel a core driver of portfolio performance in a heavily concentrated portfolio.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs just reported fourth-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, flat year over year, alongside a $235 million net loss and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $21 million. For the full year, revenue slipped to $18.6 billion from $19.2 billion, and net loss widened to $1.4 billion. Liquidity stood at $3.3 billion, and management is guiding for 2026 steel shipments of roughly 16.5 to 17.0 million net tons, with targeted unit cost reductions of about $10 per net ton.\n\nThat backdrop makes the allocation notable. This is a portfolio already concentrated in large technology names and cyclical plays, with over $225 million in Alphabet and nearly $173 million in Tower Semiconductor. Adding a nearly $100 million steel position alongside a $91 million stake in GEO tilts exposure toward economically sensitive assets.\n\nLong-term investors should focus less on quarterly losses and more on balance sheet flexibility, cost discipline, and whether improved trade dynamics and automotive demand can translate into sustained margin recovery. A position this large suggests the buyer believes the cycle is closer to a trough than a peak.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Cleveland-Cliffs right now?

However, the next phase of the AI race may not just be for a single winner. As demand shifts from GPUs to full-stack computing solutions such as CPUs, AI accelerators, and software ecosystems, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is emerging as a serious challenger.\n\nAMD entered 2025 with strong momentum and exited the year strengthening its case that it could be the next semiconductor winner. AMD stock has gained 85% in the past year, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) gain of 15%. So far this year, AMD stock is down roughly 4%.\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nLet's find out whether AMD stock is a good buy now on the dip.\nData Center and AI Represent AMD’s Growth Engine Valued at $348 billion, AMD designs high-performance processors and graphics chips used in data centers, personal computers, gaming consoles, and AI systems. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 34% year-over-year (YOY) to $10.3 billion, driven by record sales of EPYC server processors, Ryzen CPUs, and Instinct accelerators. Diluted earnings rose 40% YOY to $1.53 per share. The data center segment became the company's key growth engine. Q4 data center revenue climbed 39% YOY to $5.4 billion, driven by robust EPYC server processor demand and accelerated MI350 series GPU shipments. The adoption of fifth-generation EPYC Turin CPUs surged, “accounting for more than half of the total server revenue,” while fourth-generation EPYC processors remained in high demand.\n\nNotably, hyperscaler demand remained high, with over 230 new AMD-powered instances launched throughout the quarter. Over the course of the year, hyperscalers added more than 500 AMD-based instances, bringing the overall number of EPYC cloud instances up by more than 50% to nearly 1,600. Looking ahead, AMD anticipates continued high server demand as hyperscalers increase infrastructure to support AI and enterprises modernize data centers for emerging AI workflows. Additionally, the ramp of MI350 series shipments and additional MI308 sales to customers in China contributed to the growth of the data center AI business.\nOn the software side, AMD expanded the ROCm ecosystem, allowing for speedier deployment and better performance across a wider range of workloads. Management noted that customer interest in AMD's next-generation MI400 series and Helios platform is growing. Last quarter, AMD announced a multi-generational partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs. The company believes the launch of MI400 and Helios represents a major inflection point and expects data center revenue to grow more than 60% annually over the next three to five years, with AI revenue scaling to tens of billions of dollars annually by 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking ahead, AMD is also developing the MI500 series using the cDNA6 architecture and advanced two-nanometer process technology with HBM4e memory. AMD plans to release MI500 in 2027, aiming for another significant boost in AI performance for next-generation multimodal models.\nAMD’s Other Segments Are Going Equally Strong AMD’s Client segment revenue rose 34% to a record $3.1 billion, driven by strong demand across multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. Meanwhile, Gaming revenue increased 50% YOY to $843 million, supported by strong demand for Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs and higher channel sellout during the holiday period. AMD also launched FSR4 Redstone, its latest AI-powered upscaling technology.\nThe Embedded segment's revenue increased 3% YOY to $950 million as demand strengthened in the test and measurement and aerospace markets. AMD closed $17 billion in embedded design wins in 2025, bringing the total since acquiring Xilinx to more than $50 billion. The firm ended the quarter with a sturdy balance sheet holding $10.6 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor the full year, revenue grew 34% to $34.6 billion, with more than $7.6 billion added from data center and client revenue growth. Gross margin reached 52%, and EPS rose 26% YOY to $4.17, even as the company continued investing heavily in AI and data center initiatives.\n2026 and Beyond Could Be Exceptional AMD expects strong growth to continue into 2026, driven by increased adoption of EPYC CPUs, expanding Instinct deployments, continued client share gains, and a return to growth in embedded markets. For Q1 2026, the company expects revenue of around $9.8 billion (plus or minus $300 million), representing roughly 32% YOY growth at the midpoint.\nLooking further ahead, AMD sees revenue growth above a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three to five years, expanding operating margins, and annual EPS exceeding $20 within its strategic timeframe. Analysts forecast AMD’s earnings to increase by 60% in 2026, followed by another 58% in 2027. AMD stock is valued at 37.9 times forward earnings, compared to its historical average of 93 times.\n\nAMD’s expanding portfolio, from Helios AI infrastructure in the cloud to Ryzen processors powering edge and PC AI, positions the company to capture growth across the entire AI compute stack, making it a strong contender to Nvidia.\nIs AMD Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell Now? Overall, the consensus for AMD stock has changed from a “Moderate Buy” one month ago to a “Strong Buy” consensus now. Of the 45 analysts covering AMD, 31 rate it a “Strong Buy,” while two recommend a “Moderate Buy,” and 12 recommend a “Hold.” Based on the average price target of $288.54, analysts see potential upside of about 40% over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the high target of $380 implies a potential price increase of 84% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nHow much is being spent on AI? The three companies I want to focus on for capital expenditures spending amounts are Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms . All three of these companies are AI hyperscalers and are spending a ton on computing equipment for internal use and to rent out to customers via their cloud computing service.\nFor 2026, Amazon expects to spend $200 billion, Alphabet up to $185 billion, and Meta up to $135 billion. Combined, that's over $500 billion in capital expenditures. That's not including Microsoft , which is a major spender as well.\n\nThere are also several other companies spending billions of dollars on computing equipment that aren't even included on this list, so the reality is that AI spending is going to be as big as ever. While investors may be concerned that companies are spending too much on AI and should be concerned, that doesn't mean you should avoid investing in companies that are making money from AI right now, like Nvidia and Broadcom. Both of these are major computing unit suppliers and will make a boatload of money this year.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been the go-to AI computing units since the AI boom began in 2023. While Nvidia is seeing more challengers, it's still the top contender thanks to its full technology stack setup that allows end users to purchase everything they need from Nvidia.\n\nAnother company to watch is Broadcom. Instead of offering a GPU that can tackle a wide range of workloads, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to design a chip specifically meant for its needs. Alphabet and Broadcom have already collaborated to produce the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a wildly popular design. As Alphabet's capital expenditures soar, so will its TPU orders, boosting Broadcom's sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThere are also several other hyperscalers who are clients of Broadcom's, and each of them also expects to ramp up consumption of custom AI chips in an effort to diversify away from Nvidia's products.\nEach of these compaines is slated to benefit, but they're also just great buys in general right now.\n\nThese stocks rarely trade at these cheap valuations Wall Street analysts expect both Broadcom and Nvidia to deliver 52% revenue growth this fiscal year. That clearly indicates that the AI boom is far from over, yet the market isn't pricing in this success.\nNvidia is the cheaper of the two, trading for 24 times forward earnings. Broadcom is more expensive at 32 times forward earnings, but its success is far less predictable than Nvidia's due to its concentration with a handful of clients using its chip designs. I still think each of these AI stocks is worth investing in, although I do prefer Nvidia a tad more.\n\nWith the massive amount of money being spent on AI hardware from these three major players, Nvidia and Broadcom's stock should be rising, not falling. But that opposite is going on, so investors should use this opportunity to load up on two of the best growth stocks we've seen in years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Shares of peers Lam Research ( LRCX ) and KLA ( KLAC ) rose nearly 3% each before the bell, as Applied's upbeat outlook lifted sentiment.\n\nApplied Materials expects second-quarter sales of about $7.65 billion, plus or minus $500 million, ‌compared with estimates of $7.01 billion, ⁠according to data compiled by LSEG.\nThe results were \"fueled by the acceleration of industry investments in AI computing,\" CEO Gary Dickerson said in a statement.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow did Applied Materials perform in latest quarter?\n\nWhat are high-bandwidth memory chips and their role?\n\nHow is AI infrastructure demand affecting memory chip production?\n\nWhat drove Applied Materials' strong second-quarter revenue forecast?\n\n\"The ⁠need for higher performance and more energy-efficient chips is driving high growth rates for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\"\nThe largest U.S. semiconductor equipment maker forecast second-quarter adjusted profit of about $2.64 ​per share, ​plus or minus 20 cents, compared with estimates ​of $2.28.\n\"Memory and logic-foundry capex growth are ‌two sides of the same coin. They are both growing significantly – with memory a greater growth driver near-term,\" said Timm Schulze-Melander, a Rothschild & Co. Redburn analyst.\nLogic generally refers to a type of chip that is capable of serving as the brains of a system, such as graphics processors and central processing units.\nMEMORY IN FOCUS High-bandwidth memory (HBM), made by stacking layers of dynamic random ‌access memory (DRAM) on top of each other, refers ​to a type of advanced memory chip used alongside ​pricey AI processors such as those sold ​by Nvidia .\nApplied expects DRAM to be its fastest growing segment in ‌2026, coupled with 3D chiplet stacking — a ​technique used extensively in ​producing AI processors — Dickerson said during a post-earnings call.\nThe company reported first-quarter revenue of $7.01 billion, beating estimates of $6.87 billion.\nRevenue for the quarter ended January 25 included record DRAM ​sales on a year-on-year basis, ‌finance chief Brice Hill said during the call.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nThe company reported first-quarter profit of $2.38 ​per share, excluding items.

Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect us can be found in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can locate these reports through our website at https://investors.arista.com/ and on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/ . All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and accompanying table contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions, including the recognition of direct excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, as well as non-recurring adjustments to our tax provision resulting from the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBB Act\"). Effective the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, the Company updated its methodology for calculating the income tax effect of Non-GAAP adjustments. Previously, the Company’s calculation excluded all tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, consisting of both direct excess tax benefits and other discrete indirect effects. Under the updated methodology, the Company continues to exclude direct excess tax benefits but no longer excludes the discrete indirect effects of such awards. Management believes this change better aligns with industry practice and provides a more meaningful view of the Company’s effective tax rate. All prior period Non-GAAP results presented in this release have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nThe company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Data Center Switching, Andrew Lerner et al., 31 March 2025\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure, Mike Leibovitz et al., 25 June 2025\nGARTNER and MAGIC QUADRANT are trademarks of Gartner, Inc. and its affiliates.\nGartner does not endorse any company, vendor, product or service depicted in its publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.\nGartner publications consist of the opinions of Gartner’s business and technology insights organization and should not be construed as statements of fact.

      "Content": "1 Brilliant AI Stock That You Should Buy Hand Over Fist in 2026\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 12:49 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBroadcom 's (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock rallied nearly 600% over the past five years. Most of that growth was driven by its aggressive acquisitions and its brisk sales of AI chips. Let's see why it could still be one of the best stocks to buy in 2026 as the AI market continues to expand.\nWhy is Broadcom growing so rapidly? From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended last November), Broadcom's revenue grew at a 22% CAGR from $23.9 billion to $63.9 billion. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) rose at a 26% CAGR from $13.6 billion to $43.0 billion.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nTwo catalysts fueled that expansion. First, it expanded its infrastructure software business through major acquisitions -- including its 2023 takeover of the cloud giant VMware -- to reduce its dependence on the cyclical semiconductor market. Second, it sold more networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips to data centers to support the latest AI applications.\n\nUnlike Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which sells general-purpose data center GPUs for processing AI tasks, Broadcom sells customized AI accelerators for hyperscalers. In fiscal 2025, Broadcom's AI chip revenue surged 65% to $20 billion. That accounted for 31% of its top line and offset the slower growth of its non-AI chip and infrastructure software businesses.\nWhy will Broadcom continue to grow? Broadcom aims to generate annualized AI chip revenues of $60 billion to $90 billion by the end of fiscal 2027, with most of that growth coming from just three of its hyperscale customers. That rosy outlook suggests the world's largest cloud companies are eagerly developing their own custom AI accelerators with Broadcom to curb their long-term dependence on Nvidia.\nBroadcom will also likely continue to acquire more companies to fortify its AI chipmaking and infrastructure software businesses. Its non-AI chip businesses -- which sell a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio-frequency chips for other markets -- should also benefit from the long-term expansion of the mobile, automotive, and industrial sectors.\nFrom fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at CAGRs of 38% and 36%, as those tailwinds kick in. With an enterprise value of $1.65 trillion, it still looks reasonably valued at 26 times this year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\nStory Continues\nSo if you're looking for a balanced AI stock with plenty of upside potential, Broadcom checks all the right boxes. It might not attract as much attention as Nvidia, but it's also one of the best producers of picks and shovels for the ongoing AI gold rush.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Outperform Nvidia in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 12:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nTSM\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has played a pioneering role in artificial intelligence (AI) technology for more than three years now, which is not surprising as its chips have helped train popular large language models (LLMs) and move those models into production.\nHowever, Nvidia has been losing steam of late. The semiconductor stock is up just 3% in the past six months, driven by multiple concerns such as its valuation, the sustainability of high AI data center spending, and circular financing deals. But there's another semiconductor bellwether that has outperformed Nvidia during this period -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nLet's see why TSMC stock has jumped over 43% in the past six months and is capable of outperforming Nvidia in 2026 as well.\nTSMC is the driving force behind the AI chip revolution There is no denying that Nvidia's chip systems have been the building blocks of the global AI revolution. However, it is worth noting that TSMC has played a central role in helping Nvidia dominate the AI chip market.\nThat's because Nvidia is a fabless chipmaker, which means that it only designs and sells chips. It needs to go to a foundry -- TSMC, in this case, to get those chips manufactured. TSMC's advanced chip nodes have allowed Nvidia to turn its chip designs into reality. More importantly, TSMC doesn't manufacture AI chips for just Nvidia.\n\nIts foundries are utilized by Broadcom , AMD , Qualcomm , Apple , and other companies to make chips that power various AI applications, such as data centers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs). So, while Nvidia is reliant on TSMC to make cutting-edge chips, TSMC is the go-to manufacturer for multiple chip designers.\nThis ensures that TSMC is right in the middle of the AI chip boom. Not surprisingly, TSMC is anticipating an increase of almost 30% in revenue in 2026 in U.S. dollar terms. However, the company could easily do better than that thanks to potentially higher prices for its most advanced chip nodes, as well as an increase in its production capacity this year .\nStronger-than-anticipated growth should help TSMC outperform Nvidia Nvidia's valuation may continue to weigh on the stock in 2026. After all, it is trading at 24 times sales, a premium to TSMC's sales multiple of 15. Of course, Nvidia's valuation can be justified by the stronger growth that it can deliver in comparison to TSMC this year, with analysts expecting a 52% jump in revenue and a 63% increase in earnings in fiscal 2027 (which has just begun), but TSMC looks like the better value play that investors are more likely to be interested in.\n\nStory Continues\nAssuming TSMC's revenue indeed increases by 30% in 2026 to $159 billion (from $122.4 billion last year), and it continues to trade at 15 times sales after a year, its market cap could hit $2.4 trillion. That suggests potential upside of 33% from current levels, though don't be surprised to see TSMC stock doing better than that and continuing to outperform Nvidia stock owing to potential price rises and the new capacity that it is bringing online.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Analog Devices Governance Move Puts Special Meeting Rights In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 9:17 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nNever miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Analog Devices Narrative The company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward You will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "What Makes Monolithic Power (MPWR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 9:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MPWR\n\nMomentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nEarnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPWR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Monolithic Power on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "1 of the Best ‘Picks-and-Shovels’ Stocks to Buy Instead of Nvidia in 2026\n\nYiannis Zourmpanos\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:51 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nLITE\n\nGFSEF\n\nThe pace of artificial intelligence infrastructure investment is showing no signs of slowing, and investors are increasingly looking to companies outside the chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and into the companies enabling next-generation networking. One such company, which is seeing renewed interest, is Lumentum Holdings (LITE), as GF Securities highlighted it as one of the key beneficiaries of Nvidia’s co-packaged optics push.\n\nNvidia used this year’s GTC 2025 conference to launch its Quantum-X and Spectrum-X scale-out switch, which will likely be the precursor to further adoption of optical interconnection technology. This, in turn, should see the next-generation 115.2T CPO switch arrive in 2026, with supply chain acceleration through 2027, which should be a boon to optical component companies such as Lumentum.\nMore News from Barchart Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin as Crypto, MSTR Stock Prices Plunge.

The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\nAbout Lumentum Stock Lumentum Holdings is an optical and photonic products company based in San Jose, California, that provides products to the cloud, networking, and industrial sectors. The company, which has a market capitalization of around $40.1 billion and an enterprise value of $42.1 billion, has clearly established itself as a “mission critical” supplier to the buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nThe stock has seen an explosive move over the last year, trading at $556, with a 52-week range of $45.65-$599.50. The stock has seen an increase of over 600% in weighted alpha, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Relative strength is sitting at 74.39, which highlights the stock’s strong performance.\nThe stock’s valuation has clearly expanded with the move, and investors seem willing to pay the premium to own this stock as it relates to next-generation artificial intelligence networking infrastructure growth. The stock has seen over 94% of institutional ownership, with a short float of 15.8%.\nThe company does not pay a dividend, as it is choosing to reinvest the money into further capacity expansion and next-generation product development.\n\nLumentum Beats on Earnings as AI Demand Accelerates Lumentum’s fiscal second quarter 2026 results were a significant turning point for the company. Revenue was $665.5 million, up considerably from $402.2 million in the year-ago period. Moreover, Lumentum’s GAAP diluted EPS was $0.89, whereas its non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.67, compared with $0.42 in the year-ago period. Lumentum’s margins also improved considerably. GAAP gross margin was 36.1%, while its non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up considerably from the year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is more surprising is the fact that Lumentum’s non-GAAP operating margin was 25.2%, an increase of more than 1,700 points from the year-ago period. It appears the company is entering a new era of high volume and high value related to AI optical demand. Lumentum has identified two significant opportunities in the market, which are optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\n\nLumentum’s backlog for OCS is more than $400 million, whereas the company has announced a multi-hundred-million-dollar CPO order, which is due for the first half of calendar year 2027. Moreover, GF Securities has announced that Nvidia’s supply chain is expected to start ramping up in the second quarter of 2026, with acceleration in the second half of 2026 and into 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for LITE Stock? Analysts hold positive expectations towards the stock with a “Strong Buy” rating consensus for LITE; however, the current price targets don't quite factor in the stock’s recent run-up. The stock’s current mean target price is $525.11, which it has already surpassed, and it has a high price target of $600 and a low price target of $420.\nConsidering the stock’s recent price of around $556, the stock’s mean price target of $525.11 translates into a potential downside of around 5.6%. However, the stock’s street-high price target of $600 implies a potential upside of around 7.9% if AI networking demand continues to surprise on the upside.\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos had a position in: NVDA, LITE.

      "Content": "Is it Too Late to Buy WDC Stock After 305% Explosive Rally in a Year?\n\nShreya Majumder\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:51 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: WDC\n\n^GSPC\n\nSTX\n\nPSTG\n\nSNDK\n\nWestern Digital Corporation’s WDC shares have jumped a whopping 305.2% over the past year, far outpacing the 134.3% rally of the Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry. The stock has also outperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 21.6% and 15.7%, respectively. A major driver behind Western Digital’s rally is soaring demand for data storage from AI and cloud workloads.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company has outdone its cut-throat rival in the HDD business, Seagate Technology Holdings plc STX, and competitors in the broader storage space, such as Pure Storage PSTG, with STX and PSTG rising 301.3% and 12.6%, respectively, during the period. WDC has underperformed Sandisk Corporation SNDK, which climbed 1133.2% in a year.\n\nSeagate is a leading data storage company, with hard disk drives as its core product. Pure Storage, with its all-flash FlashArray and FlashBlade systems, targets high-performance workloads. Growing data demand continues to drive strong prospects for both PSTG and WDC in the expanding storage landscape. In February 2025, WDC split its HDD and Flash businesses into two public companies, with the new SanDisk positioned to leverage its storage expertise to capitalize on AI-driven opportunities.\nWDC has a 52-week high of $296.5. Following a strong rally, investors may wonder whether WDC still has meaningful upside or whether expectations have outpaced fundamentals. Let’s break down the pros and cons to assess the road ahead.\nWDC Reinvents the Hard Drive at Innovation Day 2026 At its Innovation Day 2026, Western Digital, now rebranded as WD, emphasized that the hard drive is far from obsolete. Instead, it is being reinvented as a foundational pillar of AI infrastructure. It introduced a refreshed three-five year financial model and unveiled updated branding aligned with its data center–centric identity. The rapid expansion of AI workloads is driving unprecedented demand for high-capacity, reliable storage as models generate massive volumes of training data, logs, checkpoints and inference datasets.\n\nIn response, Western Digital has outlined a clear, forward-looking roadmap: a 40TB UltraSMR ePMR HDD currently in qualification with two hyperscalers and slated for volume production in the second half of 2026, HAMR-based drives already in qualification with a production ramp expected in 2027, a 60TB ePMR extension that leverages HAMR innovations without increasing power requirements and a 100TB HAMR HDD targeted by 2029. Rather than pushing customers toward a single technology transition, WD is executing a dual-path strategy—maintaining leadership in both ePMR and HAMR to provide flexibility, scalability and a lower-risk migration path as storage demands continue to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nWDC is narrowing the performance gap between HDDs and QLC flash with two industry-first innovations aimed at AI workloads. High Bandwidth Drive technology enables simultaneous multi-head, multi-track read/write operations, delivering up to 2x bandwidth today with a roadmap to 8x without increasing power, and is already in customer validation. Dual Pivot Technology introduces independently operating actuators within a standard 3.5-inch drive, providing up to 2x sequential I/O gains without sacrificing capacity or requiring software changes. It is expected to be available in 2028. Together, these advancements can deliver up to 4x sequential I/O performance, supporting 100TB HDDs while maintaining current IO-per-TB ratios and reducing the need for additional SSD deployment.\n\nIt is also set to expand its Platforms business in 2027 with the introduction of an intelligent software layer and open API designed to streamline large-scale storage deployments. The platform aims to extend hyperscale storage economics to customers managing 200+ petabytes, while reducing qualification risk and accelerating time-to-production. By simplifying the adoption of UltraSMR, ePMR, HAMR and flash solutions, the initiative is expected to lower infrastructure complexity and enhance operational efficiency across enterprise environments.\nImproved Fundamentals Power WDC’s Momentum Amid the AI Boom Western Digital is benefiting from secular growth trends while delivering earnings beats and expanding profitability. For the fiscal second quarter, Western Digital generated $3.02 billion in revenue, up 25% year over year, driven primarily by strong data center demand and increased adoption of high-capacity HDDs. Cloud revenues have become the backbone of WDC’s business, accounting for a hefty and growing share of total sales. It reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 46.1%, up 770 basis points year over year. The upside resulted from a steady transition to higher-capacity drives and rigorous cost management across production facilities and the supply chain.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWDC has used capital return strategies to attract investors. In addition to strong operating performance, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns and disciplined capital allocation. In the fiscal second quarter, the company returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through $615 million in share repurchases and $48 million in dividends during the quarter.\n\nSince launching its capital return program in 2025, it has returned $1.4 billion via buybacks and dividends, highlighting the strength of its cash-generation profile. Recently, its board authorized an additional $4 billion for share repurchases, with approximately $484 million remaining under the previous authorization as of Feb. 2, 2026.\nHowever, it faces mounting near-term risks from macroeconomic instability, including tariffs and escalating trade tensions that could trigger unpredictable demand swings across enterprise and retail channels. The AI-driven storage boom, while supportive of long-term demand, is also straining operations as higher-capacity drives add manufacturing complexity and lengthen production cycles. Elevated debt levels restrict financial flexibility, limiting the company’s ability to pursue strategic acquisitions or invest aggressively in growth. As of Jan. 2, 2026, cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion, while long-term debt (including the current portion) was $4.7 billion.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend of WDC WDC’s estimates revisions are on an upward trajectory currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WDC’s earnings for fiscal 2026 has been revised north 17.4% to $8.96 over the past 60 days, while the same for fiscal 2027 has gone up 54.3% to $15.19.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKey Valuation Metric of WDC Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 21.64 forward earnings compared with 19.1 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Take: Bet on WDC Now In short, the explosion of AI-generated data is driving massive storage demand, positioning Western Digital to benefit significantly. Its competitive outlook through 2026–27 will hinge on the execution of next-generation technologies like HAMR, which could either accelerate growth or create challenges if missteps occur. As agentic AI adoption broadens, storage needs are expected to expand rapidly, supporting long-term demand. Meanwhile, ongoing share buybacks reflect management’s confidence in sustained cash flow.\n\nInvestors should balance long-term technology tailwinds with near-term market risks when making decisions. Flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, WDC seems to be a good buy.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $159, citing valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 30% year-to-date. Shopify's \"strong\" quarter, continued growth momentum and the post-earnings pullback \"represents an attractive entry point for investors to own the de facto modern-day eCommerce infrastructure,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho also upgraded Shopify to Outperform from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $150.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded BorgWarner (BWA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $82, up from $46. The firm says the company's entrance into the AI data center market is a \"pivotal shift.\"\nBarclays upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $375, up from $315. The company has the highest industrial exposure within the analog group \"by far\" and a strong correlation between its sales growth and the Purchasing Managers' Index, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan upgraded MercadoLibre (MELI) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $2,800, up from $2,650. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade following the stock's recent underperformance.\nWilliam Blair upgraded Fastly (FSLY) to Outperform from Market Perform without a price target. The company reported a \"stellar\" quarter driven by rising contribution from agentic AI traffic, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nMonness Crespi downgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Sell from Buy with a $120 price target as the firm is cutting estimates \"again\" ahead of the company's Q4 report. The firm says its prior assumption of a steady recovery over the course of calendar 2026 was \"foolish\" given the typical length and magnitude of crypto bear markets, telling investors that it now models softness through the first half of 2026 and sets its calendar 2026 and 2027 estimates below the Street view.\nJPMorgan downgraded Kraft Heinz (KHC) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $22, down from $24. The company reported a Q4 beat but its 2026 organic sales growth and earnings outlooks were below consensus estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBofA downgraded Icon (ICLR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $75, down from $195, after the company announced an internal board investigation into accounting practices and controls and noted that preliminary indications are that the company may have overstated revenues in 2023-2024 by up to 2% each fiscal year. Leerink also downgraded Icon but to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $105, down from $220.\nWells Fargo downgraded Inspire Medical (INSP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $70, down from $145. The firm says that while significant downside risk to Inspire's 2026 revenue seems less likely with its IV system availability, there is too much uncertainty about physician reimbursement that is likely to remain an overhang on shares for some time. Baird also downgraded Inspire Medical to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $74, down from $130.\nRBC Capital downgraded Humana (HUM) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $189, down from $322. Given the company's \"outsized growth\" in an uncertain reimbursement backdrop, RBC sees a balanced risk/reward setup for Humana shares at the current multiple.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBarclays initiated coverage of Microchip (MCHP) with an Equal Weight rating and $80 price target.

The company's leadership in quantum annealing is driving growth and high margins, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nH.C. Wainwright initiated coverage of Immunome (IMNM) with a Buy rating and $40 price target.

Leerink also downgraded Icon but to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $105, down from $220.\nWells Fargo downgraded Inspire Medical (INSP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $70, down from $145. The firm says that while significant downside risk to Inspire's 2026 revenue seems less likely with its IV system availability, there is too much uncertainty about physician reimbursement that is likely to remain an overhang on shares for some time. Baird also downgraded Inspire Medical to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $74, down from $130.\nRBC Capital downgraded Humana (HUM) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $189, down from $322.

O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\nRelated articles\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $3.12 billion, exhibiting an increase of 28.7% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 1.2% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Analog Devices metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue by end market- Consumer' to reach $359.11 million. The estimate suggests a change of +11.2% year over year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue by end market- Communications' reaching $423.96 million.

      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\n^GSPC\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMarvell is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +80.9%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.51 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.18 billion and $10.04 billion estimates indicate +41.9% and +22.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Marvell reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.33%.\nOver the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMarvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\nBottom Line Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nStory Continues\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

NTES reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings of $1.57 per ADS (American Depositary Share), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.66%. The figure decreased 24.2% year over year.\n\nRevenues of $3.94 billion increased 7.5% year over year. However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.82%. In domestic currency, revenues increased to RMB27.55 billion, up 3% year over year.\n\nNTES’ Q4 Segment Details NetEase delivered mixed but resilient segment performance in the quarter, led by a 3.4% year-over-year increase in Games and related value-added services revenues to RMB22.0 billion ($3.1 billion). The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net revenues from self-developed games, such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online, and newly launched games, Where Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals.\n\nYoudao revenues grew 16.8% year over year to RMB1.6 billion ($223.7 million). The year-over-year increase was driven by higher net revenues from its online marketing services and learning services.\n\nNetEase, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NetEase, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NetEase, Inc. Quote\nNetEase Cloud Music recorded a steady 4.7% year-over-year rise to RMB2.0 billion ($281.5 million).\n\nThese gains were partially offset by a 10.4% year-over-year decline in Innovative businesses and others’ revenues to RMB2.0 billion ($292.8 million). The year-over-year decrease reflected an increase in certain inter-segment transaction eliminations.\n\nNTES’ Q4 Operating Highlights Gross profit increased 8.7% year over year to RMB17.7 billion ($2.5 billion).\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 10.9% year over year to RMB9.4 billion ($1.3 billion).\n\nNet income attributable to the company’s shareholders totaled RMB6.2 billion ($892.6 million), while non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders reached RMB7.1 billion ($1.0 billion).\n\nThe effective tax rate increased year over year to 16.4% from 13.4%.\n\nNetEase’s fourth-quarter operational performance highlighted the growing impact of its long-term investment strategy, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence across its game ecosystem. Management reported that AI is now embedded throughout the full development cycle — spanning art, design, programming, animation and quality assurance — enabling higher production scalability and supporting the rollout of AI-driven gameplay innovations in flagship titles.\n\nThe company continued to benefit from strong engagement across its established franchises, underscoring the durability of its long-term operating capabilities. Titles such as Fantasy Westward Journey, Identity V, Eggy Party, Sword of Justice and Where Winds Meet maintained healthy player communities through consistent content updates.\n\nGlobal portfolio expansion remained another key theme. Sword of Justice recorded a solid reception following its international release, while Where Winds Meet surpassed 80 million cumulative players across platforms, indicating broad global traction. Marvel Rivals further strengthened its worldwide presence through high engagement and industry recognition.\n\nMeanwhile, Blizzard-operated titles in China continued to generate sustained engagement through localized content and enriched experiences, achieving record annual revenues and reinforcing NetEase’s strategic positioning in the domestic market.\n\nStory Continues\nNTES’ Balance Sheet & Cash Flow As of Dec. 31, 2025, net cash — including cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits and restricted cash, as well as short-term investments balance, minus short-term and long-term loans — increased to RMB163.5 billion (US$23.4 billion), up from RMB153.2 billion (US$21.5 billion) as of Sept. 30, 2025, reflecting continued balance sheet strength.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities increased to RMB14.8 billion ($2.1 billion) from RMB12.9 billion ($1.8 billion) in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe board of directors declared a fourth-quarter 2025 dividend of $0.232 per share ($1.16 per ADS), to be paid to its shareholders on record as of March 16, 2026.\n\nNTES’ Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Currently, NetEase carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIPG Photonics IPGP, MKS Inc.

The company manufactures a broad range of semiconductor devices, including microprocessors, mobile application processors, baseband processors, network processors, radio frequency modems, microcontrollers, and power management units. The company was established in 2009 due to the strategic shift by AMD, which decided to become a fabless company and spin off its semiconductor manufacturing business. GFS completed its initial public offering listed on Nasdaq in November 2021. The company currently operates manufacturing sites in the following locations: Malta, New York; Burlington, Vermont; Dresden, Germany; and Singapore. Given that most foundry production is concentrated in China and Taiwan, the company believes its global manufacturing footprint is a key differentiator that makes them the ideal partner for local and regional government stakeholders at a time when many regions, in particular the United States and Europe, have passed legislation contemplating significant funding to secure and grow their respective domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. GlobalFoundries' top 10 customers based on wafer shipment volume for fiscal-year 2024 included some of the largest semiconductor companies in the world: AMD, Cirrus Logic Inc., Infineon, MediaTek Inc., NXP, Qualcomm, Qorvo Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Skyworks Solutions Inc., and Sony Group Corp.'s Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Although the stock is trading up 1,220% over the past five years, it's gained only 3% over the past six months.\nWhile the company continues to demonstrate high growth and incredible opportunity, the market appears wary.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nIf you're looking for the next millionaire-maker stock, you might want to look somewhere else. While I don't recommend forgetting Nvidia entirely, and I believe it can still add value to a strong portfolio, risk-tolerant investors might consider other avenues to millionaire status.\nTake, for example, Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Pagaya Technologies (NASDAQ: PGY) . They're both growing at fast rates, but the stocks are trading much cheaper than Nvidia, giving them more room to run.\nThe case for Sandisk Sandisk stock has exploded in value, rising 1,410% over the past year, and the data storage company still has a huge long-term opportunity.\nIt generally delivers robust growth, but with the advent of data centers, for which it offers important infrastructure , growth is accelerating. In the fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended Jan. 2), revenue increased 61% year over year, driven by data center revenue growth of 64% quarter over quarter. Its other businesses, commercial and personal storage solutions, are also thriving.\n\nBeyond its recent stellar performance, management still sees meaningful growth opportunities ahead. It's working with several hyperscalers, and demand is significantly outpacing supply.\nSandisk is benefiting from AI trends right now, but it's underpinned by its dominant consumer-end businesses, providing it with low-risk, long-term growth drivers.\nThe case for Pagaya Pagaya uses AI to drive a credit business, identifying qualified borrowers through its machine learning platform, and bundling loans as asset-backed securities (ABS) to institutional funders. It just announced a new, $800 billion loan securitization funded by 32 investors, and it's the largest U.S. personal loan ABS issuer in the market.\nIt partners with many clients you'll recognize, including U.S. Bank , Visa , and SoFi Technologies , and it has 31 lending partners across a range of product types, including personal loans, credit cards, and auto loans.\nIt helps these partners approve more loans by using AI to evaluate applications and offloading the risk onto the institutional funders. It claims to be able to evaluate an application in less than one second, and it embeds its models straight into the partner platform for seamless transactions.\n\nStory Continues\nPagaya represents the future of financial services, and it's just getting started.\nShould you buy stock in Sandisk right now? Before you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,353 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,155,789 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 920 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Going back to the late 1960s, the S&P 500 and gold have been highly correlated at times and highly negatively correlated at other times. Over that period, gold and silver have had a very negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (USD), as most of the great advances in the metals have occurred during long periods of dollar weakness, and vice versa. One might think that a weak USD would coincide with strong stock-market returns, but that's just not always the case. Starting in 2014, Bitcoin (BTC) was negatively correlated with the USD. The first two massive runs by BTC occurred when the USD was weak, while two of the BTC bear markets occurred when the USD was trending higher. That negative correlation seemed to break in 2024, and there have been periods of risk-on behavior when BTC has been highly correlated with the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). Those times include 2017, March 2020 until November 2021, and a number of times since the end of the 2022 bear market. But the BTC and QQQ correlation has also been busted of late. BTC topped in October 2025 and has witnessed a nasty bear market, while the QQQ has gone sideways since October. John Murphy was the first technician to write about Intermarket Technical Analysis in his 1991 book, and he offers an important lesson: some correlations have (for the most part) lasted for decades and others that simply last until they don't. Investors have to be flexible or the markets will throw them to the wolves.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) was one of the best performers on Wednesday.\nGlobalfoundries jumped to an over one-year high on Wednesday, as investors gobbled up shares after the company swung to profitability last year, marking a 439 percent improvement year-on-year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) said that it swung to a net income of $888 million in 2025 from a $262 million net loss in 2024. This came despite a mere 1 percent uptick in net revenues at $6.79 billion from $6.75 billion year-on-year.\nIn the fourth quarter alone, net income stood at $200 million, reversing a $729 million net loss in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues, however, were flat at $1.83 billion.\nFollowing the results, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) saw its intra-day share price on Wednesday jump to as much as $48.88 before trimming a few cents to finish the session just up by 16.32 percent at $48.74 apiece.\nIn other news, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) announced plans to buy back $500 million worth of its common shares in a bid to boost shareholder value.\n\nThe buyback may be implemented from time to time, through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions, among others.\nThe initiative will run for a period of 12 months and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at anytime.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GFS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$6.36b\nUS$7.42b\nUS$7.97b\nUS$8.80b\nUS$12.1b\nUS$13.6b\nUS$15.0b\nUS$16.1b\nUS$17.2b\nUS$18.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x7\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 12.53%\nEst @ 9.80%\nEst @ 7.88%\nEst @ 6.54%\nEst @ 5.60%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%\nUS$5.7k\nUS$6.0k\nUS$5.9k\nUS$5.9k\nUS$7.3k\nUS$7.4k\nUS$7.3k\nUS$7.1k\nUS$6.9k\nUS$6.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66b\n\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 3.4%) ÷ (11%– 3.4%) = US$257b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$257b÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = US$93b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$159b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$227, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nThe Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.639. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\nSWOT Analysis for Texas Instruments Strength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\nThreat\nDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

      "Content": "QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Soft Earnings Are Actually Better Than They Appear\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:44 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nThe most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nA Closer Look At QUALCOMM's Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On QUALCOMM's Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity , or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Skyworks Solutions' (NASDAQ:SWKS) Conservative Accounting Might Explain Soft Earnings\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:SWKS ) recent soft profit numbers didn't appear to worry shareholders, as the stock price showed strength. Our analysis suggests that investors may have noticed some promising signs beyond the statutory profit figures.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nZooming In On Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Many investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow , but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\".\n\nSkyworks Solutions has an accrual ratio of -0.13 for the year to January 2026. That implies it has good cash conversion, and implies that its free cash flow solidly exceeded its profit last year. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$1.1b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$394.3m. Skyworks Solutions' free cash flow actually declined over the last year, which is disappointing, like non-biodegradable balloons. However, that's not all there is to consider. We can see that unusual items have impacted its statutory profit, and therefore the accrual ratio.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? Skyworks Solutions' profit was reduced by unusual items worth US$59m in the last twelve months, and this helped it produce high cash conversion, as reflected by its unusual items. This is what you'd expect to see where a company has a non-cash charge reducing paper profits. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If Skyworks Solutions doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nStory Continues\nOur Take On Skyworks Solutions' Profit Performance Considering both Skyworks Solutions' accrual ratio and its unusual items, we think its statutory earnings are unlikely to exaggerate the company's underlying earnings power. Based on these factors, we think Skyworks Solutions' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Skyworks Solutions has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nAfter our examination into the nature of Skyworks Solutions' profit, we've come away optimistic for the company. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

The figure increased 68.3% year over year to $443.7 million. System revenues contributed 33.3% to total revenues. The figure increased 60.1% year over year to $221.8 million.\n\nLITE Q3 2026 Guidance Ignites Estimates\n\nFor Q3 fiscal 2026 (ends March), LITE expects non-GAAP revenues between $780 and $830 million vs a prior consensus closer to $700 million. The company expects non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, vs expectations of 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings between $2.15 and $2.35 per share, vs a prior consensus under $1.60.\n\nAnd if any investor or analyst was wondering if this blistering pace was going to slow down any time soon, management said this during the conference call...\n\n&ldquo;Our forward guidance calls for over 85% year-over-year revenue growth, yet we are only at the starting line for two substantial opportunities: optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\"\n\nAnd analysts are already reflecting this optimism in Q4 FY'26 (ends June) with projected growth of 87.5% to $900 million.\n\nThe full-year 2026 sales consensus moved to $2.9 billion, representing over 76% annual growth. And FY'27 is already projected to come in near $4.7 billion, for a 61.5% advance.\n\nAs you would expect, these sales ramps, combined with improving margins, are driving the bottom line estimates higher for both this year and next.\n\nA month ago, the FY26 EPS consensus was at $5.67 and FY27 at $8.29. Today they stand at $7.63 and $14.11, representing growth of 270% and 85%, respectively.\n\nHow NVIDIA Ignited Demand for Optical Interconnect\n\nI'll admit: I was late to the optical party. And I should not have been since I follow NVIDIA so closely. Lessons learned. In December, I profiled Lumentum optical peer Coherent ( COHR ). Here's what I wrote...\n\nWe know NVIDIA is a big customer of Credo Technology ( CRDO ) AECs because CEO Jensen Huang is a big fan of copper for connecting GPUs within rack-scale architectures and Credo has repeatedly showcased its AECs in live demonstrations at the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference (GTC). These demos feature Credo's AECs connecting servers and switches directly to NVIDIA H100 GPUs to create disaggregated, rack-scale GPU clusters.\n\nBut at GTC in March [2025], Jensen announced a collaboration with a purely optical player, Coherent.\n\nOne big driver of investor enthusiasm that helped drive COHR shares from below $70 to over $190 this year was their collaboration with NVIDIA announced at GTC in March.\n\nCoherent and NVIDIA will develop silicon photonics networking switches using co-packaged optics (CPO). This ecosystem will allow AI factories to connect millions of GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA still uses copper wiring within Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale systems to connect GPUs to each other, but to \"scale out\" across the datacenter Jensen Huang recognized the power and speed of optical solutions to connect many racks together for the lowest latency.\n\nThus NVIDIA has several connectivity and networking systems that use optical and photonics solutions and they can be categorized into two main areas: Interconnect Products, including Infiniband and Ethernet protocols, and the upcoming Co-Packaged Optics, like Spectrum-X Photonics Switches.\n\nLITE and TSMC: Co-Design for the Win\n\nLumentum and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ), aka TSMC, aka THE advanced chip foundry, are two of the most critical \"ingredient\" partners in NVIDIA's move toward Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).\n\nTheir collaboration solves a massive physics problem: as AI clusters grow to millions of GPUs, traditional copper wiring and pluggable transceivers consume too much power and generate too much heat.\n\nBy moving optics into the chip package, they reduce power consumption by roughly 3.5x and increase signal integrity significantly. Here is how they work together to build this for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms like Quantum-X and Spectrum-X.\n\nBut TSMC has to provide the \"packaging\" that allows electricity and light to live on the same chip. A major challenge with CPO is that lasers are heat-sensitive. If you put a laser directly next to a hot GPU or Switch ASIC, it will fail.\n\nTSMC&rsquo;s Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) is a 3D packaging process. It allows NVIDIA to stack the Electrical IC (the brain) directly on top of the Photonic IC (the eyes).\n\nMe and the Analysts: Won't Get Fooled Again\n\nAfter I understood this integrated circuit of interdependency, I finally bought Lumentum shares in January at $350 on the pullback from $400. Most analysts were still too timid with estimates and the high price targets were only calling for $450. Heck, Morgan Stanley thought $350 was fair!\n\nAfter earnings, LITE could only manage to kiss $500 and retreat. So I sold some of my position at $485, thinking it may have gone too far, too fast.\n\nIn retrospect, I was foolish to ever doubt the risk appetite for Lumentum (LITE) based solely on the weak reception for its stellar report that day.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious as soon as the next day when everything was falling out of bed on Feb 5 because LITE tested the silly post-earnings low at $426 and reversed higher with a big fat engulfing candle to close above $500!\n\nThen Friday, as the upgrades and delayed reactions poured in, she gaps up to $540 and closes above $550.\n\nThey almost got me again with two kisses of $600 on Monday and Wednesday this week, and then another about-face. But I'm not falling for it this time.\n\nI'm holding my shares for the full realization of what NVIDIA (NVDA) is building for the next five years, where optical components are required at multiple stages and optical providers like LITE and Coherent (COHR) can be involved at different stages of design and fabrication with CPO.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the Street herd gathering around $550 with their PTs...\n\nRosenblatt $580\nJP Morgan $565\nCiti $560\nNeedam $550\nSusquehanna $550\nB. Riley $526\nMizuho $525\nBofA $520\nStifel $480\nBarclays $475 (Equal-Weight)\nUBS $455 (from $215! and stays at Neutral)\n\nSee ya next quarter when Lumentum surprises again and they raise their PTs to $650.\n\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, TSM, CRDO, and LITE shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nKevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks where he runs the TAZR Trader portfolio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Cadence Design Systems Narrative The ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider Higher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons. You might also track how Cadence links ChipStack with newer areas such as robotics AI, since success there would show that its AI tools can extend beyond classic semiconductor design into a broader intelligent-device market.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Cadence Design Systems, head to the community page for Cadence Design Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Management pointed to robust growth from networking, data center, and FPGA product lines as the primary drivers of the outperformance, with CEO Steve Sanghi noting, “Microcontrollers and analog businesses were both about flat sequentially, which was well above the typical seasonal level for December.” The quarter benefited from increased demand in aerospace and defense, while the distribution inventory correction reached a more normalized level, supporting stable operating margins and cash flow.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow did distribution inventory correction impact Microchip's results?\n\nWhat drove Microchip's Q4 revenue outperformance above estimates?\n\nWhy is Microchip prioritizing debt reduction over buybacks?\n\nWhat are Microchip's long-term gross margin improvement prospects?\n\nIs now the time to buy MCHP?

Here is what has caught our attention.\nOur Top 5 Analyst Questions From Microchip Technology’s Q4 Earnings Call Matthew Prisco (Cantor Fitzgerald) asked about the sustainability of above-seasonal growth and the drivers behind backlog strength. CFO Eric Bjornholt explained that distribution inventory is largely corrected, with strong backlog and bookings for the next quarter, but noted visibility beyond the current quarter remains limited due to short lead times.\nVivek Arya (Bank of America Securities) questioned the timeline for reaching the company’s long-term gross margin target. CEO Steve Sanghi and CFO Bjornholt said margin improvement will be gradual, with normalization of inventory reserves and underutilization charges, but did not commit to a specific timeframe.\nJim Snyder (Goldman Sachs) inquired about customer inventory behavior and the potential for restocking. Sanghi indicated restocking has not started broadly, but increased expedite requests suggest customer inventories are nearing consumption rates, especially as supply tightens.\nBlayne Curtis (Jefferies) asked about the sustainability of licensing and other segment revenue, and the impact on gross margin. Management clarified the licensing benefit will not repeat, but other product lines—including memory and FPGA—are expected to remain strong, supporting gross margin.\nChris Caso (Wolfe Research) pressed on the prioritization of debt reduction over share buybacks. Sanghi and Bjornholt emphasized a conservative approach, with no plans for repurchases until leverage is significantly reduced, following lessons from the recent downcycle.\n\nStory Continues\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters In coming quarters, the StockStory team will be monitoring (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from automotive Ethernet and industrial connectivity design wins, (2) normalization of customer and channel inventories and its effect on order patterns and lead times, and (3) progress toward improving gross margin through a richer product mix and higher factory utilization.

      "Content": "Texas Instruments (TXN): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q4 Earnings?\n\nPetr Huřťák\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 8:04 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TXN\n\n^GSPC\n\nOver the past six months, Texas Instruments has been a great trade, beating the S&P 500 by 9.4%. Its stock price has climbed to $226.03, representing a healthy 17.1% increase. This run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now the time to buy Texas Instruments, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it’s free .\n\nWhy Is Texas Instruments Not Exciting? We’re happy investors have made money, but we're swiping left on Texas Instruments for now. Here are three reasons why TXN doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own.\n1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, Texas Instruments’s sales grew at a mediocre 4.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the semiconductor sector. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. EPS Trending Down We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\nSadly for Texas Instruments, its EPS declined by 1.8% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 4.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nAs you can see below, Texas Instruments’s margin dropped by 19.6 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it’s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Texas Instruments’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 14.7%.\nFinal Judgment Texas Instruments isn’t a terrible business, but it doesn’t pass our bar. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 34.5× forward P/E (or $226.03 per share). While this valuation is fair, the upside isn’t great compared to the potential downside. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere. We’d recommend looking at one of our top software and edge computing picks .\n\nStory Continues\nStocks We Would Buy Instead of Texas Instruments The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Kadant (+351% five-year return).

      "Content": "Intel AI Push Deepens With SambaNova Bet And New GPU Chief\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 5:08 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSANS.PVT\n\nQCOM\n\nGet insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Intel Narrative The SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

Near term, the key catalyst remains AI data center demand and large custom silicon ramps, while the biggest risk is any slowdown or insourcing by those same customers. The new ESOP-related shelf registrations look immaterial to that core thesis and do not change the main risk reward balance.\nThe most relevant context for these ESOP filings is Marvell’s recently reported Q3 FY2026 results, where AI-driven data center revenue helped deliver record US$2,074.5 million in quarterly sales. That print underlined how central AI infrastructure has become to the story and why investors are focused on upcoming catalysts like the March 5 earnings call and updates on hyperscaler programs, rather than on routine share registration activity tied to employee ownership plans.\n\nYet despite this strong AI momentum, investors should still be aware that Marvell’s heavy dependence on hyperscaler data center capex leaves the business exposed if those spending plans suddenly change...\nRead the full narrative on Marvell Technology (it's free!)\nMarvell Technology's narrative projects $12.1 billion revenue and $2.9 billion earnings by 2028.

It maintained a Neutral rating. Mizuho predicted that global handset shipments will drop 4% year over year in 2026, with additional declines anticipated in the second half. This is due to memory constraints and pricing pressures. The downgrade came after an industry call on handsets.\n\nOn February 5, 2026, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) expected second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, both lower than LSEG projections. The firm attributed a global memory chip shortage to impacting smartphone users. After-hours trading saw a 9% decline in shares, which have now dropped more than 13% this year as of February 5, 2026. According to CEO Cristiano Amon, memory limits were the only reason for the projection failure. OEMs, especially in China, were cutting back on inventory as memory prices rose across the mobile device industry.\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and distributes semiconductors, software, and wireless technology solutions.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ:ENTG) dropped its net income by 19.5 percent to $235.6 million from $292.8 million in 2024.

      "Content": "Nonfarm Payrolls Increased More Than Expected\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 8:18 AM PST 3 min read\n\nPre-market trading took a nice jump higher on this morning&rsquo;s long-awaited (government-delayed) non-farm payrolls report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . That&rsquo;s because headline jobs numbers reached their highest single-month level since December 2024 to +130K &mdash; double what analysts had been expecting. The Unemployment Rate also continued to tick down: +4.3%, down 10 basis points (bps) for the second consecutive month.\n\nThat&rsquo;s a pretty neat improvement, but Wages are downright perfect: up month over month to +0.4% from +0.3% previously, but down to +3.7% year over year, which is the lowest monthly print in since February of 2021. Labor Force Participation was up slightly to 62.5%, while the U-6 read (aka &ldquo;real unemployment&rdquo;) sank to its lowest level since July to 8.0%, down 40 bps month over month.\nBy sector, Healthcare led the way once again, at +82K new jobs filled, followed by Social Assistance at +42K and Construction +33K. Interestingly, the biggest growth here was in non-residential construction, perhaps indicating data centers for AI are making their mark in the labor force. Meanwhile, the Federal Government shed -34K jobs last month, and Financial Services lost -22K.\n\nIdeal as much of these headline numbers are, there are a few flies in the ointment. Chief among them was a reassessment of 2025 job growth, which ended the year +584K but has since been revised to a more paltry +181K. Thus, for as nice as today&rsquo;s numbers look, keep in mind there are revisions likely, and they may be to the downside.\nIn all, there remain 7.4 million unemployed Americans (among those who had previously been in the workforce, so new college grads don&rsquo;t count), 1.8 million of them the long-term variety. This number increased +400K over the past year. So while the market toasts yet another metric signaling a strengthening economy, we should remain aware that the labor force is not quite as strong as it was just a couple years ago.\n\nPre-market futures are up nicely on this news: the Dow +238 points, +0.46% &mdash; riding higher after another all-time high close Tuesday &mdash; the S&P 500 +40 points, +0.57%, the Nasdaq +196, +0.78% and the small-cap Russell 2000 is currently leading all major indexes at this hour: +24 points, +0.93%.\nEarnings at a Glance Kraft Heinz (KHC) beat earnings estimates by 6 cents to 67 cents per share in Q4, but news that the anticipated split into different companies is taking a back seat, as of this morning&rsquo;s report. We see shares falling -6% as a result, swinging to a negative return year to date.\n\nStory Continues\nTower Semiconductor (TSEM) outperformed earnings estimates by +16.4% &mdash; 78 cents per share versus 67 cents in the Zacks consensus &mdash; and record revenues and raised guidance is seeing this stock climb more than +7% in early trading.\nT-Mobile (TMUS) also outpaced estimates on its bottom line this morning, reporting $2.14 per share versus $2.03 expected, but the company missed subscriber targets for the quarter, and shares are selling -2.8% at this hour.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "TSEM: Tower Revises Its Model to Higher Investment and High Margins\n\nZacks Small Cap Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 8:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\n0981.HK\n\nTSM\n\nUMC\n\nBy Lisa Thompson\nNASDAQ:TSEM\nREAD THE FULL TSEM RESEARCH REPORT\nAs demand exceeds capacity, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) has decided to accelerate its investment as it sees margins continue to expand from the sale of new products. It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.\n\nFor Q1 2026, Tower guided to revenues of $412 million plus or minus 5%, which results in slightly accelerating year-over-year growth.\nAs of last night’s closing price, the company trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.3 EV to estimated sales for 2027. Since its low at $28.54 on April 4, 2025, the stock has rocketed 379%. TSEM trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.5 EV to estimated sales for 2027, higher than its peers, who trade at an average of 5.7x. However, if we look at the components of that average, we see they diverge, with SMIC and Taiwan Semiconductor averaging 8.4x, while slower-growing Global Foundries and United Microelectronics are at or under 3.0x. At 8.4xs, TSEM stock would be worth approximately $175 per share using 2027 revenues. To be conservative, we are raising our price target to $150 as TSEM works to reach those revenue numbers.\n\nQ4 2025 Results\nThe biggest revenue contribution in the quarter again came from RF infrastructure, surpassing RF Mobile. In Q4, RF Infrastructure grew 102% to $141 million, up from $107 million in Q3 2025, and showed growth of 81.3% for the year. SiPh was $95 million of that (including some NREs) for the quarter and grew 70%. For the year, SiPh contributed $228 million compared to $106 million the year before. The growth rates are accelerating as well as the percent contribution to total sales. As they become a bigger portion of total revenues, growth should continue to accelerate.\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

      "Content": "MRVL Declines 8% in 3 Months: Time to Hold or Fold the Stock?\n\nSubham Roy\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 7:48 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nMarvell Technology MRVL shares have lost 8.2% in the past three months, underperforming its Computer and Technology sector, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and peers like Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Micron Technology MU.\nShares of Broadcom and NVIDIA have lost 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively, while Micron Technology shares have surged 52.4%. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry appreciated 2.7% in the same time frame compared with no change for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nMRVL Three-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven this decline in a month, the question arises: Should investors buy, sell or hold the stock at present? Let’s dive deeper into the fundamentals and financials of the MRVL stock to answer this question.\nSlowdown in Revenue Growth Rate is a Concern for MRVL Marvell Technology’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 signals softer near-term growth. The company guided revenues of $2.2 billion (+/- 5%), representing just 21% year-over-year growth, a slowdown compared to recent quarters. The top line has been in a declining trend for the past three quarters.\nDespite strong demand for electro-optics, management expects data center revenues to grow 20% year over year in the fourth quarter, suggesting a decelerating growth rate in the past six quarters. One of the major reasons for this decelerating growth is the growing presence of players like Broadcom and Astera Labs in the AI connectivity space.\n\nBroadcom is strong in networking, data center, broadband, Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHYs and switches. In the communications segment, Broadcom mainly provides high-speed connectivity, optical or wireline networking equipment, cable or broadband IC portfolio, PCIe switch and retimer.\nMarvell Technology’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with a 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system. The volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\nThe company recently launched the Golden Cable initiative to accelerate and expand the Active Electrical Cable ecosystem for faster deployment of AI infrastructure by cloud and hyperscaler customers. MRVL is also gaining from the adoption of scale-up switches that connect AI accelerators within and across racks, requiring multi-terabit bandwidth and ultra-low latency.\n\nMRVL Leverages Its Peers to Offer AI Products The rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Micron Technology and NVIDIA, are in the AI processing, networking and memory space. Besides semiconductor partners, MRVL has collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nStory Continues\nMicron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth. MRVL has collaborated with MU on HBM design and integration for AI compute platforms to provide a custom HBM compute architecture.\n\nThe growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Marvell Technology has partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution.\nTogether with its deep expertise in the AI semiconductor space and strong partner base, the company is able to keep its operating costs low and grow its top line at the same time, hence benefiting from a high growth rate in the bottom line. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, non-GAAP operating expenses grew just 4% year over year, even as revenues climbed 37% year over year, showcasing disciplined cost management.\nThe consensus estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 81%. The estimate has remained unchanged for the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMRVL Stock Trades at a Discount MRVL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/S) ratio of 6.87, well below the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry average of 8.4, indicating that the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold MRVL Stock for Now Although MRVL’s top line is showing a declining growth rate, the company has been able to retain its earnings growth through prudent cost measures. Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Considering these factors, we suggest investors retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

      "Content": "Best Jobs Report in Months Sends Pre-Markets Higher\n\nMark Vickery\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 7:36 AM PST 3 min read\n\nWednesday, February 11th, 2026\n\nPre-market trading took a nice jump higher on this morning&rsquo;s long-awaited (government-delayed) non-farm payrolls report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . That&rsquo;s because headline jobs numbers reached their highest single-month level since December 2024 to +130K &mdash; double what analysts had been expecting. The Unemployment Rate also continued to tick down: +4.3%, down 10 basis points (bps) for the second consecutive month.\n\nThat&rsquo;s a pretty neat improvement, but Wages are downright perfect: up month over month to +0.4% from +0.3% previously, but down to +3.7% year over year, which is the lowest monthly print in since February of 2021. Labor Force Participation was up slightly to 62.5%, while the U-6 read (aka &ldquo;real unemployment&rdquo;) sank to its lowest level since July to 8.0%, down 40 bps month over month.\n\nBy sector, Healthcare led the way once again, at +82K new jobs filled, followed by Social Assistance at +42K and Construction +33K. Interestingly, the biggest growth here was in non-residential construction, perhaps indicating data centers for AI are making their mark in the labor force. Meanwhile, the Federal Government shed -34K jobs last month, and Financial Services lost -22K.\n\nIdeal as much of these headline numbers are, there are a few flies in the ointment. Chief among them was a reassessment of 2025 job growth, which ended the year +584K but has since been revised to a more paltry +181K. Thus, for as nice as today&rsquo;s numbers look, keep in mind there are revisions likely, and they may be to the downside.\n\nIn all, there remain 7.4 million unemployed Americans (among those who had previously been in the workforce, so new college grads don&rsquo;t count), 1.8 million of them the long-term variety. This number increased +400K over the past year. So while the market toasts yet another metric signaling a strengthening economy, we should remain aware that the labor force is not quite as strong as it was just a couple years ago.\n\nPre-market futures are up nicely on this news: the Dow +238 points, +0.46% &mdash; riding higher after another all-time high close Tuesday &mdash; the S&P 500 +40 points, +0.57%, the Nasdaq +196, +0.78% and the small-cap Russell 2000 is currently leading all major indexes at this hour: +24 points, +0.93%.\n\nEarnings at a Glance\n\nKraft Heinz KHC beat earnings estimates by 6 cents to 67 cents per share in Q4, but news that the anticipated split into different companies is taking a back seat, as of this morning&rsquo;s report. We see shares falling -6% as a result, swinging to a negative return year to date.\n\nTower Semiconductor TSEM outperformed earnings estimates by +16.4% &mdash; 78 cents per share versus 67 cents in the Zacks consensus &mdash; and record revenues and raised guidance is seeing this stock climb more than +7% in early trading.\n\nT-Mobile TMUS also outpaced estimates on its bottom line this morning, reporting $2.14 per share versus $2.03 expected, but the company missed subscriber targets for the quarter, and shares are selling -2.8% at this hour.\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Investor attention is firmly focused on its surging semiconductor systems business that is driven by the AI market.\nApplied Materials has been experiencing growing traction for its foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), flash memory and advanced packaging wafer fabrication equipment as a rising number of semiconductor chip manufacturing companies are producing high quality chips used in AI and high performance computing.\n\nClick here to know how AMAT’s overall fiscal first-quarter results are likely to be.\nGrowth in the Semiconductor Systems Segment to Propel AMAT The semiconductor systems business, which is the largest contributor to AMAT’s top line, grew 4.5% throughout fiscal 2025, with strength across flash memory, DRAM and logic. AMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million.\nApplied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, DRAM revenues grew nearly 16% year over year. These factors are likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, lifting revenues of AMAT’s semiconductor systems segment. In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT’s Display and Applied Global Services to Surge in FY26 AMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\nTraction in advanced form factors like thin, light, curved and flexible displays, and new use cases like augmented and virtual reality are at the core of AMAT’s display segment’s growth story. The gross margin of AMAT’s display business hit the highest mark in the past 25 years, coming in at 48.8%, growing 120 basis points year over year. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

      "Content": "Gold.com and Qualcomm have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:55 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nGC=F\n\nGOLD\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\nBull of the Day: A recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nStory Continues\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nBear of the Day: Qualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\nBottom Line\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nAdditional content: Micron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock to Buy Now With $150\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nInvestors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nAI creates near-term headwinds but long-term tailwinds The growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nShould you buy stock in Qualcomm right now? Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,353 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,155,789 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 920 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

We expect the division to double in size in 2026, and its project pipeline to exceed $100 million by year end. This momentum is underpinned by the recent acquisition of Cobalt Power, the No. 1 solar company in Silicon Valley, which Kapil successfully completed. Since joining SunPower last fall, he has moved quickly to rebuild the New Homes organization, re-established critical relationships, strengthened operations, and rigorous quality standards. Kapil previously delivered similar results in Cypress’s Microcontroller Division, where he raised its Net Promoter Score (NPS) by more than 40 points .”\n\nKapil Rai, EVP New Homes division said, “I am honored to have the opportunity to guide the transformation of the New Homes division. SunPower’s culture is rapidly becoming one of transparency, accountability, and zero-defects – values I’ve learned are essential in delivering long-lasting customer – and shareholder – value.”\nAbout SunPower\nSunPower (Nasdaq: SPWR) is a leading residential solar services provider in North America.

      "Content": "Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $2.00\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 2:41 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MPWR\n\nThe board of Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. ( NASDAQ:MPWR ) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $2.00 on the 15th of April, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 0.7%.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems' Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, Monolithic Power Systems' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 113.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Monolithic Power Systems\nMonolithic Power Systems Has A Solid Track Record The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2016, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $8.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 26% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Monolithic Power Systems has been growing its earnings per share at 28% a year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Monolithic Power Systems could prove to be a strong dividend payer.\nWe Really Like Monolithic Power Systems' Dividend In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Monolithic Power Systems that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

      "Content": "Astera Labs (ALAB) Is Up 26.4% After Profitability Milestone And Israel AI R&D Push Has The Bull Case Changed?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 1:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ALAB\n\nRMBS\n\nIn early February 2026, Astera Labs reported past fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results showing higher sales and a move to profitability, issued first-quarter 2026 guidance, expanded its AI-focused R&D footprint with a new design center in Israel, and announced a CFO transition from Michael Tate to former Rambus finance chief Desmond Lynch effective March 2, 2026.\nTogether, these updates highlight Astera Labs’ efforts to deepen its role in AI and cloud infrastructure through expanded engineering capacity, executive bench strength, and new collaborations with major technology and cloud providers.\nNext, we’ll examine how the Israel R&D expansion and related AI connectivity ambitions may influence Astera Labs’ existing investment narrative.\n\nWe've uncovered the 14 dividend fortresses yielding 5%+ that don't just survive market storms, but thrive in them.\nAstera Labs Investment Narrative Recap To own Astera Labs, you have to believe AI and cloud infrastructure will keep demanding high performance connectivity and that Astera can stay at the center of that buildout. Right now, the key near term catalyst is continued product pull through from hyperscalers, while the biggest risk is how dependent that growth is on a concentrated, highly competitive AI capex cycle. The latest earnings beat, Israel R&D expansion, and CFO handoff look supportive rather than thesis changing in the short term.\n\nAmong the recent updates, the new Israel design center feels most relevant, because it directly ties into Astera Labs’ AI connectivity roadmap and efforts to broaden its technology and customer reach. If the expanded engineering footprint accelerates adoption of Scorpio switches and related fabrics, it could reinforce the current catalyst of rising content per AI accelerator, while also indirectly addressing customer concentration risk by enabling more use cases and deployment types across data centers.\nYet, against all the AI enthusiasm, investors should also be aware of how exposed Astera Labs remains to any slowdown or reset in hyperscaler spending on...\nRead the full narrative on Astera Labs (it's free!)\nAstera Labs' narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $393.5 million earnings by 2028.\n\nUncover how Astera Labs' forecasts yield a $199.15 fair value , a 9% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the lowest analysts were already cautious, assuming revenue of about US$1.4 billion and earnings near US$294 million by 2028, and see risks like hyperscalers shifting to internal solutions much more harshly than the consensus. This new Israel expansion and guidance could push those views to evolve in either direction, so it is worth weighing how much downside or upside you personally see in those more pessimistic assumptions.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 20 other fair value estimates on Astera Labs - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Astera Labs Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was optimistic at $805 million at the midpoint, 2.3% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.70 per share was 5.4% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy ENTG? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\nEntegris (ENTG) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $823.9 million vs analyst estimates of $812.4 million (3.1% year-on-year decline, 1.4% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $0.70 vs analyst estimates of $0.66 (5.4% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $228.1 million vs analyst estimates of $220.3 million (27.7% margin, 3.5% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $805 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $786.9 million\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.74 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.63\nOperating Margin: 12.7%, down from 17.7% in the same quarter last year\nInventory Days Outstanding: 126, down from 129 in the previous quarter\nMarket Capitalization: $20.23 billion\n\nStockStory’s Take Entegris delivered fourth-quarter results that were well received by the market, as revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share surpassed Wall Street’s expectations despite a modest year-over-year sales decline. Management credited the positive performance to continued strength in advanced node semiconductor applications, particularly in CMP consumables, liquid filtration, and selective etch products. CEO David Reeder highlighted that the company’s operational execution, including increased production volumes and disciplined working capital management, supported both margin stability and improved free cash flow.\n\nLooking ahead, Entegris’ guidance reflects optimism around industry recovery, driven by anticipated node transitions in both logic and memory, as well as growth in advanced packaging and AI-related applications. Management emphasized the ramp-up of new facilities in Taiwan and Colorado, and enhanced local manufacturing in Asia as key to meeting customer demand. CFO Linda LaGorga noted, “Higher operating cash flow in combination with reduced CapEx is expected to increase free cash flow again in 2026,” underscoring the company’s focus on improving leverage and capital efficiency.\nKey Insights from Management’s Remarks Management attributed the quarter’s performance to advanced node demand, facility ramp-ups, and ongoing cost controls, while noting that market recovery and technology transitions set the stage for future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nAdvanced node traction: Entegris secured strong positions of record (PORs) in leading-edge logic and memory nodes, particularly for CMP consumables and deposition materials, which management expects will increase the company’s content per wafer and drive future growth.\nFacility optimization: The company continued to ramp production at its new Taiwan facility and expects substantial customer qualification at its Colorado site in 2026, while rationalizing its manufacturing footprint by exiting a Pennsylvania plant and planning additional closures to improve utilization.\nChina-localization strategy: Management increased the proportion of products supplied to China from Asia-based facilities, aiming for 85% in the first quarter and targeting further gains, which enhances supply assurance and competitiveness in the region.\nFree cash flow focus: Improved free cash flow margin, supported by disciplined working capital and lower capital expenditures, enabled debt reduction and will be a key metric in both short-term and long-term incentive plans.\nSegment performance divergence: Materials Solutions saw sequential growth on strong advanced deposition demand for NAND, while Advanced Purity Solutions faced year-over-year declines due to headwinds in fluid handling, partially offset by robust liquid filtration sales.\n\nDrivers of Future Performance Entegris’ outlook is shaped by anticipated industry node transitions, facility ramp efficiency, and the ongoing recovery in semiconductor capital expenditures.\nNode transition benefits: Management expects content per wafer to increase as customers transition to new logic and memory nodes, especially two-nanometer devices and high-layer-count NAND, supporting unit-driven revenue growth.\nFacility ramp and cost leverage: Ongoing production increases in Taiwan and Colorado are poised to improve gross margins through better utilization, while further manufacturing rationalization aims to reduce fixed costs.\nCapEx and market risk: A recovery in industry fab construction and wafer fab equipment spending is critical for capital-expenditure-driven revenue, but management flagged the timing and scale of these investments as a wild card that could impact growth rates.\n\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters In the coming quarters, the StockStory team will be watching (1) the pace of advanced node adoption and content-per-wafer gains, (2) the operational ramp and customer qualification of new facilities in Taiwan and Colorado, and (3) evidence of recovery in fab construction-related demand driving improvements in capital-expenditure-sensitive product lines. Progress on local-for-local manufacturing in China and further rationalization of the production footprint will also be important to track.\nEntegris currently trades at $134.72, up from $122.39 just before the earnings.

      "Content": "Lam Research Reshapes Leadership And Partnerships For Next Generation Chip Demand\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:06 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LRCX\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nLam Research announced a set of senior leadership changes, including the retirement of its COO and the appointment of Sesha Varadarajan to the role.\nThe company added Dr. Anirudh Devgan, a key figure in electronic design automation, to its board of directors.\nLam also entered a multi year partnership with CEA Leti to work on advanced specialty technology devices and semiconductor materials.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:LRCX, these leadership and partnership moves come on top of a share price of $226.61 and very large multiyear share returns, including about 353.0% over 3 years. The stock is also up 22.5% year to date and about 174.7% over 1 year, which places these corporate decisions in the context of a company that has already seen strong recent market interest.\nBoard level changes and deep technical collaborations can influence how Lam Research positions itself in semiconductor equipment over the coming years. If you follow the stock, a key question is how this refreshed leadership team and new partner relationships shape Lam’s role in next generation chip manufacturing technologies.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Lam Research by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Lam Research.\nDoes the team leading Lam Research have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\nFor you as an investor, the key takeaway is that Lam is tightening the link between executive decision making and the chip design ecosystem while also pushing its process technology into more complex device types. The promotion of long time insider Sesha Varadarajan to COO suggests operational continuity in core etch and deposition tools, which sit at the center of AI and memory manufacturing. Bringing Cadence CEO Anirudh Devgan onto the board ties Lam more closely to electronic design automation, an area that influences how next generation chips are architected before they ever hit a fab. The multi year partnership with CEA Leti broadens Lam’s R&D reach across MEMS, 3D imaging, RF, photonics and optical interconnects, areas that matter for AI hardware, advanced data centers and high performance computing. Taken together with recent earnings strength, guidance and ongoing dividends and buybacks, these leadership and partnership steps frame a company that is actively aligning its internal structure and research pipeline with where complex chip manufacturing is heading, while still leaving you to judge execution quality and competitive outcomes against peers like Applied Materials, KLA and Tokyo Electron.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Lam Research Narrative The CEA Leti partnership and Varadarajan’s operational role tie directly into the narrative that Lam’s process technology in advanced packaging, etch and deposition can support higher wafer fab equipment demand linked to AI and memory cycles.\nAt the same time, board and C suite changes add another layer of execution risk to a story that already leans on continued leadership in complex architectures such as 3D NAND and advanced packaging, where rivals like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron are also investing heavily.\nThe appointment of an EDA focused board member and the push into specialty devices and compound semiconductors extend beyond the original narrative, which centers more on core wafer fab equipment and may not fully capture optionality in areas like RF filters, photonics and quantum related applications.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Lam Research to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Executive transition risk as Lam moves from long serving COO Patrick Lord to Sesha Varadarajan. Any disruption in operations, product execution or customer support is likely to show up quickly in a cyclical equipment market.\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged at least one risk, and the partnership and leadership changes sit against a backdrop of customer concentration and strong competition from equipment vendors such as Applied Materials and KLA that could pressure share of future spend.\n🎁 The CEA Leti agreement broadens Lam’s reach into specialty technologies such as MEMS, 3D imaging, RF and photonics, which can support its goal of serving a wider range of AI and high performance computing related device needs.\n🎁 Recent earnings strength, active capital returns through dividends and buybacks, and a board that now includes a leading EDA executive give Lam additional tools to pursue opportunities in advanced memory and packaging where it already has a meaningful presence.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track how smoothly the COO handover progresses, for example through future commentary on system shipments, service performance and customer satisfaction. Board level influence is slower to read, so watch for any shift in Lam’s product roadmap or R&D focus that ties chip design requirements more tightly to its equipment offerings. On the CEA Leti side, pay attention to concrete milestones such as joint demonstrators, published results or early customer engagements in areas like RF filters, photonics or compound semiconductor processes that use Lam’s etch and deposition tools. Finally, set the leadership and partnership story alongside future quarterly results, guidance and competitive commentary from Applied Materials, KLA and Tokyo Electron to see whether Lam’s positioning in AI infrastructure, memory and specialty technologies continues to align with where capital spending is flowing.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Lam Research, head to the community page for Lam Research to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "3 Profitable Stocks That Fall Short\n\nAdam Hejl\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 8:33 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GDDY\n\nSWKS\n\nOPCH\n\nNot all profitable companies are built to last - some rely on outdated models or unsustainable advantages. Just because a business is in the green today doesn’t mean it will thrive tomorrow.\nProfits are valuable, but they’re not everything. At StockStory, we help you identify the companies that have real staying power. Keeping that in mind, here are three profitable companies that don’t make the cut and some better opportunities instead.\n\nGoDaddy (GDDY) Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 21.9%\nKnown for its memorable Super Bowl commercials that put it on the map, GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is a domain registrar and web services provider that helps entrepreneurs establish an online presence through domain registration, website building, hosting, and e-commerce tools.\nWhy Do We Pass on GDDY?\nUnderwhelming ARR growth of 8.4% over the last year suggests the company faced challenges in acquiring and retaining long-term customers\nDemand will likely be soft over the next 12 months as Wall Street’s estimates imply tepid growth of 6.5%\nHigh servicing costs result in a relatively inferior gross margin of 63.6% that must be offset through increased usage\n\nAt $96.62 per share, GoDaddy trades at 2.6x forward price-to-sales. If you’re considering GDDY for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more .\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 10.4%\nResult of a merger of Alpha Industries and the wireless communications division of Conexant, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) is a designer and manufacturer of chips used in smartphones, autos, and industrial applications to amplify, filter, and process wireless signals.\nWhy Are We Out on SWKS?\nProducts and services are facing end-market challenges during this cycle, as seen in its flat sales over the last five years\nForecasted revenue decline of 8.1% for the upcoming 12 months implies demand will fall even further\nExpenses have increased as a percentage of revenue over the last five years as its operating margin fell by 18.7 percentage points\n\nSkyworks Solutions’s stock price of $62.30 implies a valuation ratio of 13.7x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including SWKS in your portfolio, it’s free .\nOption Care Health (OPCH) Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 6%\nWith a nationwide network of 177 locations serving 43 states and a team of over 4,500 clinicians, Option Care Health (NASDAQ:OPCH) is the largest independent provider of home and alternate site infusion services, delivering medications and clinical support to patients across the United States.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Are We Wary of OPCH?\nOption Care Health is trading at $33.12 per share, or 18.2x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why OPCH doesn’t pass our bar .\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Tecnoglass (+1,754% five-year return).

Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than ARHS .\nADT (ADT) Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 16.9%\nFounded in 1874 and headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, ADT (NYSE:ADT) is a provider of security, automation, and smart home solutions, offering comprehensive services for home and business protection.\nWhy Are We Out on ADT?\nProducts and services fail to spark excitement with consumers, as seen in its flat sales over the last five years\nCapital intensity will likely ramp up in the next year as its free cash flow margin is expected to contract by 2.2 percentage points\nUnderwhelming 6.1% return on capital reflects management’s difficulties in finding profitable growth opportunities\n\nADT is trading at $8.17 per share, or 8.8x forward P/E.

The big rise in the use of biologics like monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, biosimilars, and cell and gene therapies has created a strong need for effective and large-scale bioprocessing solutions for both development and commercial production.\n\nThe U.S. biomanufacturing initiatives are crucial for expanding the bioprocessing market because they drive demand for small-scale bioprocessing systems used in process optimization, pilot production, and clinical trials based on the commercialization of successful biologics. Conversely, the commercialization of successful biologics drives the development of large-scale bioprocessing facilities.\nMoreover, the bottlenecks caused by the introduction of new agreements are smoothed out through superior innovation and desirably less contamination risks and shorter time-to-market periods. Concurrently with these advancements, there are the positive regulatory environments, government funding, and support for domestic biomanufacturing that are the main driving forces of the global infrastructure expansion. The shift toward personalized medicine has also been the increasing focus, which combined with the expansion of contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and growing biopharmaceutical activity in the emerging regions, is a key factor that supports the continuous growing of the large and small-scale bioprocessing market and thus makes it a central factor together with others, in the uninterrupted growth of the market.\n\n(A free sample of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing report is available upon request; please contact us for more information.)\nOur Free Sample Report Consists of the following:\nThe updated report for 2026 includes an introduction, an overview, and an in-depth industry analysis.\nProvide detailed chapter-by-chapter guidance on the Request.\nUpdated Regional Analysis with a Graphical Representation of Size, Share, and Trends for the Year 2026\nIncludes Tables and figures that have been updated.\nThe most recent version of the report includes the Top Market Players, their Business Strategies, Sales Volume, and Revenue Analysis\nCustom Market Insights (CMI) research methodology\n(Please note that the sample of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing report has been modified to include the COVID-19 impact study prior to delivery.)\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing Market Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/large-and-small-scale-bioprocessing-market/\nSegment Insight\nBy Product Type\nThe bioreactors/fermenters segment is expected to hold the largest market share in 2025. The increase is attributed to the fact that they are at the core of upstream biomanufacturing processes. The role of bioreactors and fermenters is crucial as they provide the medium to grow cells and microorganisms for the manufacture of biologics, vaccines, recombinant proteins, enzymes, and cell and gene therapies. Biopharmaceutical pipeline expansion and the increasing number of drugs moving from clinical trials to marketing are the two main factors driving the demand for small bioreactors in research, process development, and pilot studies, as well as for large fermenters that are used in high-volume commercial production, and this demand is being significantly increased.\n\nBy Application\nThe biopharmaceuticals segment dominates the market over the projected period.

Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1-800-715-9871 and using conference ID 5908687. The call will also be webcast and can be accessed at the Astera Labs website at https://ir.asteralabs.com/ . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay on the company’s website for the next six months.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those concerning our financial outlook, to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP measure can be found later in this release. The timing and impact of any adjustments to arrive at the corresponding GAAP financial measures concerning our financial outlook are inherently dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or that may be outside of our control. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP pro forma diluted earnings per share, and non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average share count. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP pro forma diluted earnings per share, and non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average share count provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nWe adjust the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense\nWe exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate non-cash stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. Moreover, stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash charge that can vary significantly from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance, and therefore excluding this item provides investors and other users of our financial information with information that allows meaningful comparisons of our business performance across periods.\n\nAcquisition-related costs\nWe exclude acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions, which we generally would have not otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. Acquisition-related costs include certain incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination such as third-party costs: advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional fees. We believe that providing the non-GAAP measures excluding these costs assists our investors because such costs are not reflective of our ongoing operating results.\nEmployer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation resulting from our IPO\nWe exclude employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and net settlement of restricted stock units in connection with our initial public offering (the “IPO”), because this does not correlate to the operation of our business. We believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance given the amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions was immaterial prior to our IPO.\n\nIncome tax effect\nThis represents the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis and one-off discrete tax adjustments that are unrelated to our core operating performance in connection with the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. This approach is designed to enhance investors’ ability to understand the impact of our non-GAAP tax expense on our current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments.\nNon-GAAP pro forma weighted-average shares to compute non-GAAP pro forma net income per share\nWe present non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average shares, assuming our redeemable convertible preferred stock is converted from the beginning of each respective periods presented, to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding EPS trend on a consistent basis. All of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock converted into the equivalent number of shares of common stock in connection with our IPO.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on Astera Labs' current expectations. The words “accelerating,” “advance,” “aims,” “anticipate,” “beginning,” “believe,\" “confidence,” “committed,” “continue,” “could,” “deliver,” “designed,” “drive,” “enable,” “estimate,\" “expand,” “expect,\" “forecasting,” “forthcoming,” “forward,” “future,” “goal,” “growth,” “guidance,” “intend,\" “look,” “may,” “momentum,” “on track,” “opportunities,” “outlook,” “paths,” “plan,” “poised,” “positioning,” “progress,” “proliferate,” “proposed,” “prospects,” “provide,” “represents,” “roadmaps,” “should,” “strategies,” “target,” “trends,” “upside,” “ultimately,” “vision,” “will,” and similar phrases as they relate to Astera Labs are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor(s) may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on any of the forward-looking statements.

      "Content": "Entegris Q4 Earnings Call Highlights\n\nMarketBeat\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 12:49 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ENTG\n\nKey Points Entegris beat or hit guidance in Q4 with sales of $824 million (down 3% y/y, up 2% sequentially), a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7% , and non‑GAAP EPS of $0.70 , while full‑year unit‑driven revenue rose about 2% and CapEx‑driven revenue fell ~ 7% .\nFree cash flow improved to $404 million (a 12.7% FCF margin) in 2025, CapEx was $299 million and is expected to decline to ~ $250 million in 2026, while net debt ended Q4 around $3.4 billion with net leverage at 3.8x and a target to get below 3.5x by end‑2026.\nManagement sees a more constructive 2026 backed by mid‑single‑digit industry MSI growth, > 20% NAND bit growth and node transitions (including 2nm) that should raise content per wafer, alongside POR wins at advanced nodes and a push to increase local‑for‑local Asia supply for China.\nInterested in Entegris, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIndustrial Tech Crossovers: When Manufacturing Meets Innovation\nEntegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) reported fourth-quarter 2025 results that came in at the high end or above its guidance ranges, as management emphasized disciplined execution and early signs of a more constructive semiconductor backdrop heading into 2026.\nChief Executive Officer Dave Reeder said fourth-quarter revenue, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP EPS all landed at the high end or above guidance. For the full year, he said total revenue was approximately flat versus 2024 excluding divestitures, with “unit-driven” revenue up about 2% in 2025 and “CapEx-driven” revenue down 7% in line with reduced industry fab construction spending.\nFourth-quarter results and segment performance → 3 ETFs Designed to Survive the Next Market Crash\n5 Trends You Need to Know This Quarter\nChief Financial Officer Linda LaGorga said fourth-quarter sales were $824 million , down 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. GAAP gross margin was 43.8% , and non-GAAP gross margin was 44% , with the sequential improvement driven primarily by increased production volumes.\nLaGorga reported GAAP operating expenses of $256 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $188 million . Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7% of revenue, above guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70 , which she said was above guidance.\n\n→ 3 Consumer Staples Stocks Breaking Out This Month\nChip Gear Maker Entegris Has Potential, But Is It Buyable Now?\nBy segment, LaGorga outlined:\nMaterial Solutions (MS): Q4 sales of $362 million , flat year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Sequential growth was driven primarily by advanced deposition materials, supported by demand for molybdenum (moly) deposition within NAND. Adjusted operating margin was 20.9% .\nAdvanced Purity Solutions (APS): Q4 sales of $465 million , down 5% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by fluid handling and FOUPs, partially offset by liquid filtration, which delivered “another record quarter.” Adjusted operating margin was 24.8% .\n\nStory Continues\nCash flow, leverage, and capital spending For 2025, LaGorga said free cash flow was $404 million , representing a 12.7% free cash flow margin, nearly a 300 basis point improvement year over year. She attributed the improvement to working capital execution, including accounts receivable and reduced year-over-year inventory growth.\n→ 2 Subscription Economy Winners That Still Dominate Their Niches\nCapital expenditures in 2025 were $299 million , about 9% of sales. Reeder added that Entegris has completed a multi-year manufacturing CapEx investment cycle that began in 2022 and expects 2026 CapEx to decline to $250 million , with longer-term CapEx returning to approximately 7% to 8% of sales.\n\nOn the balance sheet, LaGorga said Entegris paid down $150 million of term loan debt in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Gross debt ended the quarter at about $3.7 billion , with net debt of $3.4 billion . Net leverage ended 2025 at 3.8x , and management reiterated a target to reduce net leverage to below 3.5x by the end of 2026.\n2026 demand outlook: node transitions, MSI growth, and CapEx variability Reeder said the industry backdrop “appears more constructive” in 2026 and highlighted multiple areas that could support improvement versus 2025, including logic and memory node transitions, stronger industry MSI (wafer starts) growth, and a recovery in fab construction spending.\nManagement expects mid-single-digit industry MSI growth in 2026 and noted that about 75% of Entegris revenue is unit-driven and correlated to MSI. Reeder said advanced logic utilization is already near 100%, and he expects demand for 2-nanometer devices to meaningfully increase wafer output through 2026, benefiting Entegris through higher content per wafer and the company’s share positions at advanced nodes.\n\nIn memory, Reeder described NAND transitions from “low 250 layers” to about 300 layers and said next-generation DRAM and HBM products are expected to roll out in 2026. He said NAND bit growth is expected to exceed 20% in 2026, driven more by higher layer count than a major increase in MSI, and he expects a double-digit increase in NAND content per wafer tied to higher layer nodes and new materials such as moly and selective etch.\nFor CapEx-driven exposure, management said 25% of company revenue is tied to industry CapEx, with roughly two-thirds of that correlated to fab construction and one-third to wafer fab equipment (WFE). Reeder said fab construction spending is expected to grow modestly in 2026 after a high single-digit decline in 2025, while WFE is expected to deliver strong growth. He cautioned during Q&A that the timing of fab construction-related demand has been moving “pretty significantly month to month,” and he characterized the fab CapEx portion as a “wild card,” potentially more second-half weighted.\n\nOperational priorities: POR wins, footprint actions, and local-for-local manufacturing Reeder updated investors on four CEO priorities he first discussed last quarter:\nDeepening customer intimacy and securing positions of record (PORs): He said Entegris has secured strong POR positions at the most advanced logic nodes across product lines including CMP consumables, advanced deposition and implant materials, liquid purification/filtration, and wafer handling. He also cited traction in advanced memory (DRAM/HBM) and POR wins in next-generation NAND across deposition materials, CMP, and selective etch applications.\nImproving utilization and rationalizing the footprint: Reeder said the Taiwan facility continues to ramp, and the Colorado facility is expected to substantially complete key customer product qualifications in 2026. He also said Entegris exited its Chester, Pennsylvania facility in the fourth quarter and expects to rationalize at least one additional facility in the first half of 2026.\nImproving free cash flow: Reeder said free cash flow margin improved to 12.7% in 2025, in line with the company’s target, and that free cash flow is now incorporated into short- and long-term incentive plans.\nIncreasing local-for-local manufacturing (especially for China): Reeder said the company expects about 85% of China revenue in the first quarter to be supplied by Asia facilities, with the proportion increasing through 2026.\n\nOn China, management said China remained about 21% of sales in both 2024 and 2025, with dollars down slightly. Reeder said the company’s main obstacle in China is assuring supply, and he expects continued progress in qualifying more Asia-based manufacturing to support that market.\nReeder also said Entegris is rescheduling its Capital Markets Day from May to the fall due to the CFO transition, and he thanked LaGorga for her contributions.\nFirst-quarter outlook and near-term margin commentary For the first quarter, LaGorga guided sales of $785 million to $825 million , reflecting about a 4% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Gross margin is expected to be 44.5% to 45.5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including about 100 basis points of benefit in Q1 from a change related to the useful lives of assets.\nShe guided EBITDA margin of 26.5% to 27.5% , GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.51 , and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.78 . For Q2, management expects sales to increase 1% to 3% sequentially from Q1, in line with normal seasonality.\n\nIn Q&A, management said gross margin has stabilized around the current range, with volume leverage, the Taiwan ramp, and facility rationalizations expected to support improvement as production increases.\nAbout Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) Entegris, Inc is a leading provider of advanced materials and process control solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries.

Shares of semiconductor materials supplier Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) jumped 10.2% in the afternoon session after the company reported fourth-quarter results that beat analyst expectations and provided a strong forecast for the first quarter of 2026.\nThe advanced materials supplier posted adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share on revenue of $823.9 million, surpassing consensus estimates. While these results were positive compared to forecasts, they represented a decline from the same period in the previous year when the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share. However, the key driver for the stock's rise appeared to be the company's upbeat outlook. For the first quarter of 2026, Entegris forecasted revenue between $785 million and $825 million, with adjusted earnings per share ranging from $0.70 to $0.78. This guidance was comfortably above analyst expectations, suggesting stronger performance ahead and boosting investor confidence.\n\nIs now the time to buy Entegris?

But moves this big are rare even for Entegris and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock gained 11.9% on the news that UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded the stock from a \"Neutral\" to a \"Buy\" rating and significantly raised the price target. The price target saw a substantial increase to $145.00 from $90.00, reflecting strong confidence in the company's future. Adding to the bullish sentiment, KeyBanc also lifted its price target on the shares to $111 from $107. This wave of positive analyst ratings followed Entegris's announcement that its board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, which supported investor confidence in the company's financial health.\nEntegris is up 49.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $133.91 per share, has set a new 52-week high.

Shares of analog chips maker onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) jumped 3.1% in the afternoon session after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results where earnings per share beat analyst estimates, but revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter fell short. The analog chip maker posted an adjusted EPS of $0.64, beating the consensus estimate of $0.62. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, in line with expectations but representing an 11.2% decline from the previous year. However, the positive earnings surprise was tempered by the company's forecast for the first quarter, which projected both revenue and earnings below Wall Street's projections. Despite the weak outlook, investors appeared to focus on the better-than-expected profit and a strong free cash flow margin of 31.7% for the quarter. The stock's rally represented a significant reversal from an initial 4.6% drop immediately following the earnings release, suggesting a shift in sentiment as the market digested the full report.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $66.82, up 1.7% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy onsemi? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us onsemi’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 18 days ago when the stock dropped 2.7% on the news that Intel reported disappointing earnings report and weak forecast for the current quarter. Shares of the chipmaker plunged about 12% after it posted a fourth-quarter loss and provided a softer-than-expected outlook. The company's first-quarter revenue projections of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion fell short of analyst consensus. More concerning for the broader sector, Intel executives flagged industry-wide supply shortages as a significant problem that could persist into 2026, with supply capabilities expected to be at their lowest point in the first quarter. When a market leader like Intel signals such widespread issues, it often creates a ripple effect, raising investor concerns about the health and near-term prospects of the entire semiconductor industry.\nonsemi is up 17.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $66.82 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of onsemi’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,674.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

A : David Reeder, CEO, explained that the industry backdrop for 2026 appears more constructive than in 2025. Entegris expects to benefit from node transitions in both logic and memory, which typically drive additional content per wafer. While CapEx was not favorable in 2025, it is expected to be more constructive in 2026, particularly in fab CapEx. The company is cautiously optimistic about achieving outperformance, contingent on the timing of node transitions and CapEx developments.\n\nQ : How should we think about the margin trajectory for 2026, given the guidance for Q1? A : Linda Lagorga, CFO, noted that gross margin has stabilized and is expected to improve with increased production volumes. The ramping of the Taiwan facility and rationalization of existing facilities are expected to contribute to margin improvement. The company is focused on volume leverage to drive margins, which will positively impact EBITDA.\nQ : What is the outlook for MSI (wafer starts) and CapEx for 2026? A : David Reeder, CEO, stated that MSI is expected to grow in the mid-single digits for 2026. CapEx is anticipated to be up modestly, with strong growth in WFE (wafer fab equipment) and a potential increase in fab construction CapEx in the second half of the year. The company is monitoring these factors closely as they impact revenue growth.\n\nQ : Can you provide an update on the competitive landscape in China and how Entegris is addressing it? A : David Reeder, CEO, emphasized that the fundamentals in China are similar to the rest of the world, focusing on yield and performance. Entegris is working to assure supply to Chinese customers by qualifying more manufacturing overseas, particularly in Asia. The company expects to supply approximately 85% of China revenue from regional facilities in Q1, with plans to increase this proportion through 2026.\nQ : How is Entegris positioned to benefit from the growth in AI and advanced packaging markets? A : David Reeder, CEO, highlighted that about 60% of Entegris' revenue comes from advanced nodes, with AI being a significant growth driver. The company is focusing on advanced packaging, which grew nicely in 2025 and is expected to continue growing in 2026. Entegris is making concerted efforts to expand its product lines in this area, anticipating more benefits in 2027 and beyond.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary\n\nMoby Intelligence\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ENTG\n\nStrategic Performance Drivers Performance in 2025 was characterized by a 2% growth in unit-driven revenue, offset by a 7% decline in CapEx-related sales due to a slowdown in industry fab construction.\nManagement attributes future growth to node transitions in logic and memory, specifically the ramp of two-nanometer devices and NAND layer migrations from 250 to 300 layers.\nStrategic positioning is focused on 'customer intimacy' to secure key positions of record (PORs) in advanced nodes, which expands served available market and content per wafer.\nOperational efficiency is being addressed through a multiyear manufacturing cycle completion, allowing for a reduction in 2026 CapEx to $250 million while maintaining capacity for $1 billion in incremental revenue.\nThe company is executing a 'local for local' strategy in China to mitigate supply chain risks, aiming to supply over 90% of China revenue from within Asia by the end of 2026.\nAdvanced logic and memory now represent over 60% of total revenue, with AI-enabled applications serving as the primary growth catalyst for these high-margin segments.\n\n2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Guidance for 2026 assumes a 'middish single-digit' industry MSI growth, with Entegris expecting to outperform this through higher content per wafer in advanced nodes.\nManagement anticipates a reversal in fab construction spending trends, expecting modest growth in 2026 followed by a more meaningful acceleration in 2027.\nFree cash flow is expected to increase in 2026 due to higher operating cash flow and reduced CapEx, supporting a net leverage target of below 3.5 times by year-end.\nQ2 2026 revenue is projected to increase 1% to 3% sequentially, following normal industry seasonality and current order patterns.\nThe company plans to rationalize at least one additional manufacturing facility in the first half of 2026 to further improve utilization and gross margins.\n\nStructural and Risk Factors A change in the accounting assessment of the useful lives of assets is expected to provide a 100 basis point positive impact to gross margins starting in Q1 2026.\nManagement flagged potential 'demand destruction' in mainstream logic markets during the second half of 2026 if ongoing memory shortages persist.\nThe Capital Markets Day originally scheduled for May has been postponed to the fall of 2026 following the announced CFO transition.\nSilicon carbide, previously a headwind in 2025, is expected to stabilize and potentially improve slightly throughout 2026.\n\nQ&A Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here.\n\nStory Continues\nSustainability of growing 3-6% faster than the underlying market Management stated that outperformance is typically highest during node transitions which drive content per wafer; they feel the setup is constructive for a return to these levels.\nThe timing of these transitions and the volatility of fab CapEx remain the primary variables for the exact magnitude of outperformance in 2026.\nCompetitive dynamics and supply assurance in the China market The primary competitive hurdle in China is guaranteeing supply; Entegris is addressing this by shifting 85-90% of production for China to Asian facilities.\nManagement noted that when supply is assured, Chinese customers prioritize yield and performance, where Entegris maintains a competitive advantage.\nNAND market inflection and layer count vs. wafer starts While NAND pricing has firmed, incremental wafer starts remain 'measured' as producers focus on node migrations to higher layer counts.\nEntegris is relatively indifferent between layer count growth and wafer growth, though full wafer starts provide slightly more total benefit.\nOne stock.

      "Content": "Is Marvell Technology (MRVL) Fairly Priced After Recent Share Price Weakness?\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:12 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nIf you are trying to figure out whether Marvell Technology is attractively priced or not, this article will walk you through how its current share price stacks up against different measures of value.\nThe stock last closed at US$82.35, with returns of 4.7% over the past week, a 1.0% decline over the past month, a 7.9% decline year to date, a 26.8% decline over the past year, a 56.1% gain over five years, and an 82.6% gain over three years.\nRecent coverage around Marvell has focused on its position in semiconductors and investor interest in how it fits into broader technology themes. This helps frame why the share price has been moving. This context matters because sentiment, expectations, and sector focus can all affect what investors are willing to pay for the stock at any given time.\nOn our valuation checks, Marvell scores 5 out of 6 for being considered undervalued, as shown in our valuation score . Next, we will look at the usual valuation approaches before finishing with a way to assess value that brings these methods together in a more complete picture.\n\nFind out why Marvell Technology's -26.8% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Marvell Technology Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model takes the cash Marvell Technology is expected to generate in the future, then discounts those projections back to today to estimate what the business might be worth in dollars right now.\nMarvell currently has trailing twelve month free cash flow of about $1.50b. Using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, analysts and extrapolated estimates project free cash flow reaching about $6.38b in 2031. Simply Wall St provides ten year projections, combining analyst inputs for earlier years with extrapolated figures in later years based on those inputs.\n\nPutting those cash flows together and discounting them back to today gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $83.26 per share, compared with the recent share price of $82.35. That implies the stock is roughly 1.1% below this DCF estimate, which sits within a fairly tight band around the current market price.\nResult: ABOUT RIGHT\nMarvell Technology is fairly valued according to our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) , but this can change at a moment's notice. Track the value in your watchlist or portfolio and be alerted on when to act.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Marvell Technology.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Marvell Technology Price vs Earnings For a profitable company like Marvell Technology, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of earnings. Investors typically accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see lower risk, and prefer a lower P/E when growth expectations are more modest or risks feel higher.\nMarvell currently trades on a P/E of 29.0x. The broader Semiconductor industry average is about 44.2x, and the peer group average provided is 79.2x, so the stock is priced below both of those reference points. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 42.5x, which is the P/E level it would expect for Marvell given factors such as its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.\n\nThis Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it adjusts for company specific traits rather than assuming one size fits all. With Marvell’s current P/E of 29.0x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 42.5x, this framework suggests the shares are trading at a discount to what might be considered a more company specific fair value range.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

These are simple stories you create about Marvell Technology that tie your own assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins into a financial forecast, connect that forecast to a Fair Value, sit inside the Community page on Simply Wall St where millions of investors share their views, update automatically as fresh news or earnings arrive, and can differ widely. For example, one investor might have a more optimistic view that lines up with a Fair Value of about US$148 per share, while another might have a more cautious view closer to US$90. This helps you compare those Fair Values with today’s share price to decide whether you see the stock as closer to a buy, hold, or sell in your own framework.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Marvell Technology?

Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\nAMAT Gains From Traction Across Its Portfolio AMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nAMAT Navigates Competitive Challenges Applied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although they develop solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holdings develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions like Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in GAA transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nWith these factors in place, AMAT’s long-term growth outlook remains strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 revenues are expected to rise 13.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 earnings is expected to grow 22% year over year. AMAT's fiscal 2027 earnings estimates have been revised upward in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Buy AMAT Stock for Now The continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging, driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing, is a tailwind for AMAT stock.

      "Content": "Arm Stock Rises on Accelerating AI Revenue, But a Big Risk Remains\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 7:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) shares rose after the company -- which sells critical design architecture for making semiconductors -- saw artificial intelligence (AI) demand boost its revenue. The stock, however, has still lost about a third of its value over the past year and it faces a big potential risk next fiscal year. Let's see what that is -- and what investors should do.\n\nAI powers results, but smartphone risk emerges After an initial dip following its results, Arm shares rallied as investors turned their focus more toward its AI opportunities than worries about smartphones. Arm said it sees its data center business becoming its largest segment in the coming year, and that it will reach a 50% market share among top hyperscalers. This growth is being led by the shift toward inference and AI agents, which it says makes central processing units (CPUs) more important within the data center.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHowever, the company did admit that increasing memory supply constraints could put a dent in smartphone sales, with talk of a potential 15% reduction in volumes over the next year. That said, it noted that even a 20% reduction would only equate to a 2% to 4% effect on its smartphone royalties. However, this company is trading at a growth multiple, so that is a big potential risk.\nOverall, Arm's fiscal third-quarter revenue jumped 26% year over year to $1.24 billion. License revenue rose by 25% year over year to $505 million. Its agreement with Softbank contributed $200 million to that total. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by two, to 50. Over half of its top 30 customers use this license. It also added six Arm Flexible Access customers, bringing the total to 318.\n\nRoyalty revenue, meanwhile, rose 27% year over year to $737 million. The growth was driven by increased adoption of newer ARM technology, including Armv9 architecture and Arm CSS (compute subsystems), which carry higher royalty rates. It said five customers are now shipping devices with CSS chips, including the top four Android phone makers.\nAnnualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, soared 28% to $1.62 billion. Looking ahead, Arm guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to come in around $1.47 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%. Royalty growth is projected to be up by the low teens and licensing by the high teens. It forecasts that adjusted earnings per share will be between $0.54 and 0.62.\n\nStory Continues\nIs ARM's stock a buy? Arm's licensing and royalty business model is attractive given its high gross margin and recurring nature, and the company has an opportunity to continue to grow nicely in the data center space. Meanwhile, its ties to Softbank provide a steady stream of growth.\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 49 based on analysts' fiscal 2027 consensus, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.7 (with below 1 considered undervalued), ARM looks reasonably priced. However, the likely weakness in the smartphone market next year isn't necessarily embedded in those estimates, and as such, this would keep me on the sidelines for now.\n\nShould you buy stock in Arm Holdings right now? Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "NVTS Trades at Premium Valuation: Should You Hold or Fold the Stock?\n\nOm Jaiswal\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 7:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVTS\n\nLRCX\n\nFORM\n\nAMAT\n\nNavitas Semiconductor NVTS is currently trading at a high price-to-sales (P/S) multiple compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Navitas Semiconductor’s forward 12-month P/S ratio sits at 49.54X, significantly higher than the industry’s forward 12-month P/S ratio of 8.26X. The Zacks Value Score of F also suggests that NVTS stock is overvalued.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor stock trades at a higher P/S multiple compared with other industry peers, including Lam Research LRCX, Applied Materials AMAT and FormFactor FORM. At present, Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have P/S multiples of 11.58X, 8.46X and 7.69X, respectively.\nNVTS Forward 12-Month P/S Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNavitas Semiconductor’s elevated valuation raises concerns about whether the stock can justify such lofty multiples. Considering the premium valuation, investors must be wondering whether they should buy, hold or sell the stock, especially amid near-term challenges.\n\nMobile Business Exit to Hurt NVTS' Near-Term Prospects Navitas Semiconductor has decided to walk away from its low-margin mobile products to focus its resources on high-power business. This strategic decision is hurting the company’s top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2025, NVTS’s revenues decreased 53.4% year over year to $10.1 million, reflecting adverse impacts from its strategic decision to deprioritize its lower-margin China mobile business.\nThe company projects a further decline in its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2025. Navitas Semiconductor expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenues to be $7 million (+/- $0.25 million), down significantly on a sequential basis as the company is pruning its low-margin mobile business to align its resources toward high-power business.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s decision to prune its mobile business seems to have weighed on investors’ sentiments, as reflected by a decline in NVTS’ share price over the past three months. NVTS stock has plunged 11% over the past month, underperforming the industry’s decline of 2.7%.\nThe stock has underperformed its industry peers, including Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor. Shares of Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have returned 3.8%, 7.6% and 31%, respectively.\n1-Month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, for investors, not everything is gloom and doom.\nRising Demand in Data Centers Boosts NVTS’ Prospects Navitas Semiconductor is shifting its focus toward high-power markets, such as AI data centers, performance computing, energy and grid infrastructure, and industrial electrification. This strategic move aligns with the company’s “Navitas 2.0” strategy, under which the company is reallocating resources toward high-power markets, pruning lower-margin mobile business, and working more closely with hyperscalers, graphics processing unit vendors and system OEMs.\n\nStory Continues\nNavitas Semiconductor’s inclusion in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt AI factory ecosystem is an important step. The new architecture shifts data center power distribution from traditional AC/DC stages to a high-voltage DC approach that requires faster, more efficient power electronics. This creates an opening for Navitas Semiconductor’s gallium nitride (GaN) and high-voltage silicon carbide (SiC) technologies, both of which are now part of the NVIDIA-led ecosystem.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Navitas Semiconductor highlighted that it is one of the few companies offering both GaN and SiC solutions across the full power path from the grid to the graphics processing unit. The company has begun sampling mid-voltage GaN devices at 100 volts, which target the last stage of power conversion inside AI servers. It is also sampling 2.3 kV and 3.3 kV SiC modules for grid and energy storage applications that support these new data center designs.\nNVTS expects 2026 to be a transition year, with small but growing shipments tied to traditional server power supplies. The larger opportunity depends on how fast hyperscalers adopt the 800-volt architecture and will depend on Navitas Semiconductor's ability to secure multi-generation design wins.\n\nNVTS to Benefit From Strategic Partnerships Navitas Semiconductor is strengthening its position in high-power markets through strategic partnerships. In mid-December, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its distribution relationship with Avnet, making the latter a globally franchised distribution partner. Under the deal, Avnet will provide technical and commercial support for NVTS’ GaN and SiC products across regions.\nIn early December, NVTS entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Cyient Semiconductors to accelerate GaN adoption in India. The two companies plan to co-develop GaN products, system modules and design platforms aimed at high-voltage, high-power markets, such as AI data centers, electric mobility and grid infrastructure.\n\nIn late November, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its partnership with WT Microelectronics in Asia. NVTS is consolidating its distributor base, and WT Microelectronics will take the lead for customer engagement and logistics in Asia, per the partnership agreement. This collaboration is meant to improve support for high-power customers in the region.\nIn mid-November, Navitas Semiconductor announced a long-term partnership with GlobalFoundries. Under this collaboration, the two companies will develop and manufacture next-generation GaN power devices at Global Foundries’ Vermont facility, with development planned for early 2026 and production expected later that year.\nThese partnerships bode well for the company's prospects as Navitas Semiconductor is trying to prepare for future demand. Through these strategic partnerships, NVTS aims to strengthen its supply chain, improve customer access, and prepare for large future opportunities, once high-power markets begin to scale in 2026 and 2027.\n\nKey Technical Indicator Signals Bullish Trend for NVTS NVTS shares are trading above their 50-day & 200-day moving averages, a bullish technical signal that indicates the potential for continued upward momentum in the near term.\nNVTS 50-Day & 200-day Simple Moving Average\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold Navitas Semiconductor Stock Right Now Navitas Semiconductor is in a good position to benefit from the fast growth of AI data centers and is making steady progress through its strategic partnerships, which bode well for the company’s prospects and support its long-term growth plans. The company’s GaN and high-voltage SiC products now play a role in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt power setup, which shows that the technology is relevant and in demand.\nHowever, Navitas Semiconductor’s premium valuation warrants a cautious approach to the stock.\nNavitas Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Entegris (ENTG) Is Up 7.6% After Soft Q1 2026 Outlook Tempers Solid 2025 Results\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 7:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ENTG\n\nEntegris reported past fourth-quarter 2025 results showing sales of US$823.9 million and net income of US$49.4 million, alongside full-year 2025 sales of US$3.20 billion and net income of US$235.6 million.\nAt the same time, the company issued unaudited guidance for the first quarter of 2026 that pointed to softer revenue and earnings than analysts had been expecting, shifting attention toward its near-term profit outlook.\nWe’ll now examine how Entegris’s below-consensus first-quarter 2026 guidance shapes its investment narrative following a modestly positive recent share performance.\n\nThe latest GPUs need a type of rare earth metal called Neodymium and there are only 30 companies in the world exploring or producing it . Find the list for free.\nWhat Is Entegris' Investment Narrative? To own Entegris, you really have to believe in the long-term need for its specialty materials across semiconductor manufacturing, while accepting some near-term earnings bumpiness. The latest Q4 2025 numbers showed slightly softer full-year profit, and the new Q1 2026 guidance, while still pointing to solid revenue of about US$785 million to US$825 million, fell short of prior expectations and refocused attention on margins and demand timing. That feels particularly important with the shares having climbed strongly in recent months and already trading on a richer earnings multiple than many peers. On top of that, the upcoming CFO transition introduces another moving part just as the company works through a softer patch. Altogether, this guidance update makes near-term execution risk a more central part of the story.\n\nHowever, one risk around Entegris’s high valuation and softer guidance deserves closer attention.

      "Content": "Is Lumentum Stock a Smart Investment Option Post Q2 Earnings?\n\nKashvi Chandgothia\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 7:09 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nMRVL\n\nLITE\n\nCOHR\n\nLumentum Holdings LITE shares have surged 24% following the release of its second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 4, 2026. The uptick can be attributed to a remarkable 65.5% top-line growth, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.85%. EPS of $1.67 surpassed the consensus mark by 18.68%. This exceptional performance reflects accelerating demand for optical connectivity solutions powering AI infrastructure, successful execution across multiple product lines and the company's strategic positioning as a foundational technology provider to hyperscale data center customers.\n\nLITE shares have appreciated 128.6% over the past three months, significantly outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's decline of 1.3% and the Communication - Components industry's advance of 44.8%. The stock has substantially outpaced peers, with Coherent Corp. COHR shares advancing 53.4%, Broadcom AVGO declining 2%, and Marvell Technology MRVL declining 7.9% over the same period. This remarkable outperformance reflects the company's technology leadership in ultra-high-power lasers and early mover advantage in optical circuit switches, positioning it as a critical supplier for AI data center connectivity.\n\nLITE Stock Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLITE's Q2 Results Reveal Accelerating Business Momentum The fiscal second-quarter results mark a significant inflection point for LITE, driven by strengthening demand for AI infrastructure connectivity solutions. Robust revenue growth reflects accelerating customer adoption of optical technologies that address bandwidth and power efficiency challenges in modern AI workloads.

The company's technology leadership in high-speed optical components has positioned it as an essential supplier to hyperscale customers deploying next-generation network architectures.\n\nProfitability improved dramatically, with non-GAAP operating margin reaching 25.2%, an expansion of 1,730 basis points year over year. This margin expansion reflects operational leverage as production scales, strategic pricing power enabled by tight supply conditions and a favorable product mix shift toward advanced offerings like 200-gigabit lane speed devices. LITE expects robust momentum to continue, with revenues anticipated at $780-830 million for the fiscal third-quarter. Operating margin is projected to expand further to 30-31%, while EPS is expected at $2.15-2.35. This outlook represents meaningful acceleration, which reflects intensifying AI infrastructure investments by hyperscale operators, successful capacity expansion initiatives and the company's broadening product portfolio across optical circuit switches, co-packaged optics and cloud transceivers.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter EPS is pegged at $2.24, up by 47.4% over the past 30 days. The figure indicates 292.98% growth year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nLumentum Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus Lumentum Holdings Inc. price-consensus-chart | Lumentum Holdings Inc. Quote\nLITE Benefits From Strong Product Portfolio Across AI Infrastructure LITE has become a key technology provider for AI networks, benefiting from the shift toward optical connectivity solutions. Traditional electrical switches struggle with the bandwidth and power needs of AI training clusters, driving demand for Optical Circuit Switches (OCS). OCS technology allows hyperscale operators to dynamically reconfigure network setups and optimize resources based on changing workload demands. The OCS business has emerged as a major growth driver, with fiscal second-quarter revenue surpassing $10 million three months earlier than expected.

CPO integrates optical connections directly into processor packages, cutting power use and boosting performance as AI systems become more densely packed. LITE has secured a multi-hundred-million-dollar purchase order for ultra-high-power lasers supporting CPO applications, with deliveries expected in the first half of 2027. The transceiver business has rebounded strongly, with fiscal second-quarter revenue exceeding previous levels as customers shift to 1.6-terabit speeds. LITE competes effectively with Broadcom, Marvell Technology and Coherent Corp. across these segments, with higher-speed products commanding better prices and manufacturing improvements strengthening profit margins.\n\nLITE's Valuation Reflects Premium Growth Profile LITE is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales of 10.28x, above the sub-industry average of 5.23x and sector average of 6.49x. Among peers, Broadcom commands 15.42x, while Coherent Corp. trades at 5.85x and Marvell Technology at 6.9x. The premium valuation appears justified given the company's exceptional fundamentals, including revenue growth exceeding 85% year over year, operating margins expanding toward 30% and diversified revenue streams across optical circuit switches, co-packaged optics and cloud transceivers.\n\nLITE’s P/S Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion LITE demonstrates exceptional execution with strong fiscal second-quarter performance and substantially increased forward guidance. The company's diversified portfolio across optical circuit switches, co-packaged optics and cloud transceivers, backed by an order backlog exceeding $400 million, provides strong revenue visibility into 2027. The early mover advantage in OCS and technology leadership position LITE favorably against peers. Despite the recent rally, the premium valuation appears justified given exceptional growth trajectory, rapidly expanding profitability and strategic positioning within the multi-year AI infrastructure buildout cycle.\n\nLumentum Holdings currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of B, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

In the trailing 12 months, Lam Research shares have soared 174.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 35.1%. It has also outpaced the returns of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation. Shares of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation have rallied 90%, 80.4% and 21.6%, respectively.\n\nLam Research One-Year Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlthough it seems investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock, the billion-dollar question is: Is it justified to overpay?\nIn our opinion, Lam Research’s strong growth prospects amid artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for advanced nodes justify this premium valuation. The company’s high growth potential in AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets, along with back-to-back quarters of strong financial performance, suggest that LRCX stock’s upward momentum is far from over.\n\nLam Research’s Resilient Financial Performance Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical issues, and trade and tariff wars, LRCX’s financials remain impressive. In the company’s last reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, total revenues rose 22% year over year to $5.34 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily driven by continued demand across the Systems and Customer Support Business Group segments.\nLam Research reported second-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.27 per share, which beat the consensus mark by 8.5%. The bottom line also increased 39.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation Quote\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the second quarter, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 34.3%, up 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which is impressive, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 19.5% and 21.2%, respectively. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings per share indicates growth of 26.1% and 24.4%, respectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Buy LRCX Stock Right Now Lam Research’s solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling investment option right now despite lofty valuations. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.\nCurrently, Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Texas Instruments (TXN) Reliance on International Sales: What Investors Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TXN\n\nHave you evaluated the performance of Texas Instruments' (TXN) international operations for the quarter ending December 2025? Given the extensive global presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nWhile analyzing TXN's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.42 billion, showing rise of 10.4%. We will now explore the breakdown of TXN's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\nA Dive into TXN's International Revenue Trends During the quarter, Japan contributed $290 million in revenue, making up 6.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $297.43 million, this meant a surprise of -2.5%. Looking back, Japan contributed $313 million, or 6.6%, in the previous quarter, and $277 million, or 6.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nRest of World generated $98 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 2.2% of the total. This represented a surprise of +26.34% compared to the $77.57 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of World accounted for $74 million (1.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $69 million (1.7%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $948 million came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 21.4%. This represented a surprise of +3.13% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $919.21 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $972 million, or 20.5%, and $786 million, or 19.6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nRest of Asia accounted for 10.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $457 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.19%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $476.96 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Rest of Asia contributed $505 million (10.7%) and $432 million (10.8%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nChina generated $951 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.9% compared to the $933.3 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, China accounted for $1.02 billion (21.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $821 million (20.5%) to the total revenue.\nInternational Market Revenue Projections Wall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments to report $4.51 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to contribute 6.5% (translating to $293.26 million), 1.7% ($77.37 million), 20.5% ($925.54 million), 10.5% ($473.62 million), and 20.7% ($933.44 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $19.36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 9.5% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to make up 6.4%, 1.7%, 20%, 10.3%, and 20.5% of this total, corresponding to $1.24 billion, $322.14 million, $3.86 billion, $2 billion, and $3.97 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Bottom Line Texas Instruments' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\nTexas Instruments, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nProduction-Ready, Full-Stack Edge AI Solutions Turn Microchip’s MCUs and MPUs Into Catalysts for Intelligent Real-Time Decision-Making\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc.\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 4:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MCHP\n\nMCHPP\n\nCompany simplifies and accelerates edge AI system development with silicon, software, tools, production-ready applications and support from a growing partner ecosystem\nCHANDLER, Ariz., Feb. 10, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A major next step for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) innovation is moving ML models from the cloud to the edge for real-time inferencing and decision-making applications in today’s industrial, automotive, data center and consumer Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) has extended its edge AI offering with full-stack solutions that streamline development of production-ready applications using its microcontrollers (MCUs) and microprocessors (MPUs) – the devices that are located closest to the many sensors at the edge that gather sensor data, control motors, trigger alarms and actuators, and more.\n\nMicrochip’s products are long-time embedded-design workhorses, and the new solutions turn its MCUs and MPUs into complete platforms for bringing secure, efficient and scalable intelligence to the edge. The company has rapidly built and expanded its growing, full-stack portfolio of silicon, software and tools that solve edge AI performance, power consumption and security challenges while simplifying implementation.\n“AI at the edge is no longer experimental—it’s expected, because of its many advantages over cloud implementations,” said Mark Reiten, corporate vice president of Microchip’s Edge AI business unit. “We created our Edge AI business unit to combine our MCUs, MPUs and FPGAs with optimized ML models plus model acceleration and robust development tools. Now, the addition of the first in our planned family of application solutions accelerates the design of secure and efficient intelligent systems that are ready to deploy in demanding markets.”\n\nMicrochip’s new full-stack application solutions for its MCUs and MPUs encompass pre-trained and deployable models as well as application code that can be modified, enhanced and applied to different environments. This can be done either through Microchip’s embedded software and ML development tools or those from Microchip partners. The new solutions include:\nDetection and classification of dangerous electrical arc faults using AI-based signal analysis\nCondition monitoring and equipment health assessment for predictive maintenance\nFacial recognition with liveness detection supporting secure, on-device identity verification\nKeyword spotting for consumer, industrial and automotive command-and-control interfaces\n\nStory Continues\nDevelopment Tools for AI at the Edge\nEngineers can leverage familiar Microchip development platforms to rapidly prototype and deploy AI models, reducing complexity and accelerating design cycles. The company’s MPLAB® X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with its MPLAB Harmony software framework and MPLAB ML Development Suite plug-in provides a unified and scalable approach for supporting embedded AI model integration through optimized libraries. Developers can, for example, start with simple proof-of-concept tasks on 8-bit MCUs and move them to production-ready high-performance applications on Microchip’s 16- or 32-bit MCUs.\n\nFor its FPGAs, Microchip’s VectorBlox™ Accelerator SDK 2.0 AI/ML inference platform accelerates vision, Human-Machine Interface (HMI), sensor analytics and other computationally intensive workloads at the edge while also enabling training, simulation and model optimization within a consistent workflow.\nOther support includes training and enablement tools like the company’s motor control reference design featuring its dsPIC® DSCs for data extraction in a real-time edge AI data pipeline, and others for load disaggregation in smart e-metering, object detection and counting, and motion surveillance. Microchip also helps solve edge AI challenges through complementary components that are required for product design and development. These include PCIe® devices that connect embedded compute at the edge and high-density power modules that enable edge AI in industrial automation and data center applications.\n\nThe analyst firm IoT Analytics stated in its October 2025 market report that embedding edge AI capabilities directly into MCUs is among the top four industry trends, enabling AI-driven applications “...that reduce latency, enhance data privacy, and lower dependency on cloud infrastructure.” Microchip’s AI initiative reinforces this trend with its MCU and MPU platform, as well as its FPGAs. Edge AI ecosystems increasingly require support for both software AI accelerators and integrated hardware acceleration on multiple devices across a range of memory configurations.\nAvailability\nMicrochip is actively working with customers of its full-stack application solutions, providing a variety of model training and other workflow support. The company is also working with multiple partners whose software provides developers with additional deployment-ready options.

      "Content": "2 Dividend Stocks That Are Off to Hot Starts to 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 2:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: LMT\n\n^GSPC\n\nTXN\n\nThe S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nLockheed Martin Entering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\nTexas Instruments Another stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Lockheed Martin right now? Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\nSee the 10 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 10, 2026.\nDavid Jagielski, CPA has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Management pointed to ongoing growth in edge IoT, automotive, and data center segments, which collectively contributed to outperformance relative to Wall Street’s revenue and profit expectations. CEO Philip Brace attributed the quarter's results to robust execution in flagship mobile programs and expanding design wins in Wi-Fi 7 and automotive connectivity, while highlighting that smartphone replacement cycles are beginning to shorten. Management maintained a focus on disciplined investment and customer engagement amid industry-wide component pricing conversations.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow will the Qorvo acquisition benefit Skyworks?\n\nWhat drove Skyworks Solutions' Q4 revenue outperformance?\n\nWhat pricing pressures is Skyworks facing?\n\nWhat are Skyworks' main growth opportunities?\n\nIs now the time to buy SWKS? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.00 billion (3.1% year-on-year decline, 3.4% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $1.54 vs analyst estimates of $1.40 (10.1% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $325 million vs analyst estimates of $277.5 million (31.4% margin, 17.1% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $900 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $871.5 million\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.04 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.96\nOperating Margin: 10%, down from 16.9% in the same quarter last year\nInventory Days Outstanding: 115, up from 105 in the previous quarter\nMarket Capitalization: $9.26 billion\n\nWhile we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\nOur Top 5 Analyst Questions From Skyworks Solutions’s Q4 Earnings Call Harsh Kumar (Piper Sandler) asked about the specific technology and R&D benefits of the Qorvo deal. CEO Philip Brace highlighted complementary portfolios, particularly in RF technologies, and the potential to innovate across product categories.\nKarl Ackerman (BNP Paribas) questioned where broad market growth would be strongest and what would drive long-term expansion. Brace pointed to Wi-Fi adoption, automotive connectivity, and data center power/timing products as main growth areas.\nEdward Snyder (Charter Equity Research) probed on mobile content stability and mix impact. Brace explained that content gains could be moderated by model mix, making blended content per device flat, and noted ongoing strong demand.\nTimothy Arcuri (UBS) inquired about potential pricing pressure from the largest customer and repurchase activity. CFO Philip Carter said competitive pricing remains dynamic, but current demand is absorbing supply, and buybacks will be considered with financial prudence.\nPeter Peng (JPMorgan) asked about unit demand and seasonality in the mobile segment. Brace confirmed strong current demand and said seasonality remains normal, with no unusual patterns anticipated.\n\nStory Continues\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters In the coming quarters, the StockStory team will be watching (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from Wi-Fi 7 and automotive connectivity, (2) execution on data center power and timing product launches, and (3) progress on integration planning and regulatory milestones for the Qorvo transaction. The company’s ability to manage mobile content stability and pricing dynamics will also be a key area of focus.\nSkyworks Solutions currently trades at $61.45, up from $55.93 just before the earnings.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nARENA Private Wealth, a Midwest RIA Firm, Plays a Leading Role in $230M Series B for Positron AI\n\nPR Newswire\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 12:12 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: POSC\n\nARM\n\nMidwest-based RIA steps into growth-stage capital leadership role typically held by coastal venture firms.\nCHICAGO , Feb. 9, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- ARENA Private Wealth, a Midwest-based registered investment advisor with offices in Chicago, Cleveland, and Columbus, today announced that it played the lead role in a $230 million Series B fundraising round for Positron AI, a growth-stage technology company building energy-efficient AI inference hardware. The round values Positron at over $1 billion, achieving unicorn status, and was announced at the Web Summit Qatar.\nThe Series B was led by ARENA Private Wealth alongside Jump Trading and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Arm Holdings, and Helena, as well as participation from existing investors. Capital raises of this size and stature are most often led by technology-focused venture capital firms based on the coasts, making ARENA's leadership role a notable departure from the traditional Series B playbook.\n\nRather than operating as a traditional venture capital firm, ARENA approaches growth-stage investing as an alternative capital partner. The firm positions itself as a bridge between private wealth and founders through an integrated platform spanning Private Wealth, Alternatives, and Capital Markets.\nFor ARENA's investors, this model provides access to differentiated direct investment opportunities that are typically available only through large venture funds or institutional vehicles. Through ARENA's relationships, diligence process, and ability to structure and lead transactions, investors can participate directly in opportunities like Positron, gaining exposure at a meaningful stage while remaining aligned with a disciplined, long-term approach to risk.\n\n\"Opportunities like this are rare, and that's exactly why they can be so meaningful for our investors,\" said Ari Schottenstein, Head of Alternatives at ARENA Private Wealth. \"We say no far more often than we say yes, and when we do step forward, it's because we've done the work to understand the risks and believe the opportunity justifies that responsibility. Positron stood out because the leadership, market position, and timing aligned in a way that allowed us to bring something truly differentiated to our clients.\"\nFor founders, ARENA offers capital without competing interests and a fundraising option that operates outside traditional venture networks. In addition to capital, founders gain access to a broader and less homogeneous network, a strategic perspective informed by multiple markets and asset classes, and a collaborative partner focused on execution, alignment, and long-term value creation.\n\nStory Continues\n\"As a founder, you're used to thinking about venture firms and strategic investors as your primary options,\" said Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron AI. \"What stood out about working with ARENA was their ability to show up as a true capital partner, bringing collaborative strategy, access to an expansive network of relationships, and a new perspective that helped us think differently about how we scale.\"\n\n\"This investment reflects how growth-stage companies are opening the door to who they want at the table,\" said Schottenstein. \"Positron has shipping traction today and a credible roadmap ahead, and our role was to support that vision by showing up with broader investor support and alignment around long-term value creation.\"\nThe Positron transaction marks an inflection point in the technology capital landscape, driven by rising investor interest in alternative investments. ARENA's role illustrates how a modern private wealth firm can lead this next chapter as a relevant capital partner, stepping forward with conviction to source and shape opportunities, expanding the network of capital and ideas that support growth-stage companies.\n\nAbout ARENA Private Wealth\nARENA Private Wealth is a Midwest-based wealth management firm offering an integrated platform across Private Wealth, Alternatives, and Capital Markets. With offices in Chicago, Cleveland, and Columbus, ARENA connects clients to differentiated opportunities through deep relationships, disciplined diligence, and a coordinated approach to long-term portfolio strategy.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at NXP Semiconductors ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NXP Semiconductors:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.15 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2025) .\nThus, NXP Semiconductors has an ROCE of 15%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.1% generated by the Semiconductor industry.\nSee our latest analysis for NXP Semiconductors\nIn the above chart we have measured NXP Semiconductors' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for NXP Semiconductors .\nThe Trend Of ROCE We like the trends that we're seeing from NXP Semiconductors. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 15%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 27%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nThe Bottom Line In summary, it's great to see that NXP Semiconductors can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 26% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\n\nStory Continues\nLike most companies, NXP Semiconductors does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Chip Stock Could Be a Top Performer by 2027\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 2:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TXN\n\nNVDA\n\nWhen investors look at investing in computer chips to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they are likely to start with a company like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . That makes sense, given that it makes the most popular chips for handling AI workloads. However, there's another chip stock that could also turn out to be a huge AI winner: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) .\n\nWhat does Texas Instruments do? Nvidia makes high-powered parallel processing chips that act as the primary brains that undergird AI software. Texas Instruments makes analog chips, the boring ones that convert physical events into digital signals. When you push a button on a digital device, it is likely being controlled by an analog chip. Texas Instruments' chips are simple, relatively low cost, and can be found in tech products virtually everywhere.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nIn the artificial intelligence hardware world, Texas Instruments' chips provide power management. That's a vital function within the data centers that house AI. Given the expectation that the AI infrastructure buildout is only just beginning, Texas Instruments could have years of growth ahead of it in this end market.\n\nTexas Instruments is gearing up Over the last few years, the analog chip sector has been in a rut. However, Texas Instruments has been investing in new chip production capacity. Just recently, it agreed to buy competitor Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) . In other words, Texas Instruments is preparing for growth.\nIt is also shifting the way it reports its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company broke out its data center business as a separate end market. The segment accounted for around 9% of the top line. However, it grew 64% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's probably not a number to bake into your growth expectations, given that the AI opportunity is brand new. Still, revenue rose by a mid-single-digit percentage from the third quarter. If this is just the beginning of the AI buildout, this segment could help supercharge an upturn in the typically cyclical analog chip sector and support growth for years to come.\nTexas Instruments is an analog leader There are other analog chipmakers , and there are chipmakers that make more exciting chips than Texas Instruments. However, for most investors, opening a position in this industry-leading company will probably set you up for long-term success. And given the strength of the business and the company's growth efforts, the AI buildout could easily turn Texas Instruments into a top-performing chipmaker by 2027, if not sooner.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Texas Instruments right now? Before you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Texas Instruments wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

(NXPI) designs and delivers advanced chips across processors, connectivity, analog, security, and sensor technologies. With a market cap of roughly $56.5 billion, the company forms the invisible backbone of vehicles, factories, Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, mobile devices, and modern communications infrastructure.\n\nWhile the business footprint looks expansive, stock performance has introduced a more restrained narrative. Over the past 52 weeks, NXPI stock gained 3.5%, trailing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) 14% gain. Year-to-date (YTD), however, the stock rose 3.3%, edging past the broader index’s modest 1.3% increase.\nMore News from Barchart Inflation, Earnings and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\nWhy Alphabet's Free Cash Flow Could Survive, Despite the Market's Fears - How to Play GOOGL\nShould You Buy AT&T Stock After Its Amazon Leo Win?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nPlacing that performance within the sector sharpens perspective. The State Street SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) surged 45.3% over the same 52-week period and added 11.6% YTD.\nOn Feb. 2, NXP Semiconductors reported its Q4 2025 earnings results, immediately lifting the stock 2.2%. Revenue grew 7.2% year over year to $3.34 billion, topping the $3.3 billion analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS rose 5.3% to $3.35, clearing Wall Street’s $3.30 forecast with room to spare.\n\nDespite beating headline estimates, NXPI stock slid 4.5% in the next trading session as investors focused on elevated inventories and emerging signs of long-term margin pressure. However, management countered with a strategic reset anchored in “physical artificial intelligence (AI),” emphasizing accelerating demand for industrial products with built-in intelligence at the edge.\nLeadership also cited stronger regional manufacturing amid geopolitical pressure. As automakers stop trimming orders and inventory correction fades, management now sees visibility into growth from next-generation, AI-enabled products.\nThe outlook carries into the forward estimates. For fiscal year 2026, ending in December, analysts project diluted EPS of $12.37, implying 21.3% year-over-year growth. Importantly, NXP Semiconductors has beaten EPS expectations in three of the past four quarters, missing only once.\nWall Street sentiment remains firmly supportive, assigning NXPI stock an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Out of 30 analysts, 22 rate NXPI stock a “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” and six suggest “Hold.”\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, the outlook remains unchanged from three months ago, when 22 analysts also labeled the stock a “Strong Buy.”\nWhile NXPI stock has lagged peers from a growth standpoint, recent demand commentary appears stronger than that of many competitors. Reinforcing this view, TD Cowen raised its price target to $285 from $260 on Jan. 16 while maintaining a “Buy” rating on the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, analyst targets paint a clearer picture of what the market believes the stock can deliver. NXPI’s average price target of $259.67 implies potential upside of 15.8%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $324.40 suggests a gain of 44.6% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "5 Insightful Analyst Questions From NXP Semiconductors’s Q4 Earnings Call\n\nKayode Omotosho\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 9:31 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nNXP Semiconductors’ fourth quarter saw year-over-year growth driven by improved demand across automotive and industrial end markets. Management attributed the quarter’s performance to a rebound in automotive revenue, particularly as inventory adjustment cycles wound down, and to broad-based strength in industrial and IoT segments. CEO Rafael Sotomayor noted, “Our auto business returned to growth year-over-year, and the guide we provided continues that trend.” However, management also acknowledged that persistent weakness in communications infrastructure and the impact of recent divestitures, such as the sale of the MEMS sensor business, weighed on sentiment.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nWhat drove NXP's Q4 revenue growth and performance?\n\nHow is NXP's automotive business recovery progressing?\n\nWhat are analysts' main concerns about NXP's outlook?\n\nHow will recent business divestitures impact NXP's future revenue?\n\nIs now the time to buy NXPI? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $3.34 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.31 billion (7.2% year-on-year growth, 0.7% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $3.35 vs analyst estimates of $3.31 (1.2% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $1.32 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.29 billion (39.6% margin, 2% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $3.15 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $3.10 billion\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $2.97 at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting\nOperating Margin: 22.3%, in line with the same quarter last year\nInventory Days Outstanding: 155, down from 161 in the previous quarter\nMarket Capitalization: $56.46 billion\n\nWhile we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\nOur Top 5 Analyst Questions From NXP Semiconductors’s Q4 Earnings Call Thomas O’Malley (Barclays) questioned the pace of channel inventory restocking and whether NXP intended to reach its long-term 11-week target in 2026; CEO Rafael Sotomayor replied that improved demand will support this gradual shift.\nMatthew Prisco (Cantor) asked for detail on recent customer order trends and whether improved order patterns would persist; CFO Bill Betz said internal signals and backlog have improved, supporting optimism for 2026.\nRoss Seymore (Deutsche Bank) inquired about the impact of MEMS and RF Power business exits on revenue and growth; Betz explained MEMS will have a $300 million annual impact, with RF Power revenue tapering over several years.\nJoseph Quatrochi (Wells Fargo) pressed for specifics on how acquisitions accelerate the SDV portfolio; Sotomayor emphasized that TTTech Auto enhances the software-defined architecture and strengthens customer engagement for new vehicle platforms.\nVivek Arya (BofA Securities) probed the sustainability of industrial and IoT growth, particularly after a strong start to the year; Sotomayor responded that growth is broad-based across industrial applications, with design wins in healthcare and automation leading the way.\n\nStory Continues\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters Going forward, the StockStory team will monitor (1) execution on new SDV and physical AI product ramps, (2) the pace and profitability of the company’s transition away from non-core businesses like RF Power and MEMS, and (3) continued improvement in working capital efficiency, especially inventory management. The impact of recent acquisitions and customer adoption of next-generation platforms will also be key factors in assessing NXP’s trajectory.\nNXP Semiconductors currently trades at $223.69, down from $231.08 just before the earnings.

That is higher than both the US Semiconductor peer average of 35.8x and an estimated fair ratio of 42.5x, which suggests less room for error if growth or margins soften.\n\nStory Continues\nFor you, the question is whether this premium feels earned, or whether it leaves too little cushion if sentiment or earnings expectations shift.\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Rambus Narrative If you feel differently about these assumptions and would rather test the numbers yourself, you can build a custom Rambus view in minutes by starting with Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Rambus research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\nReady to hunt for more investment ideas?

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\nIf you are wondering whether Rambus at around US$107.10 is still a sensible entry or worth holding, the key question is how its current price lines up with underlying business value.\nThe share price has been volatile recently, with a 5.9% decline over the last 7 days, a 14.7% gain over 30 days, a 7.9% return year to date, 59.9% over 1 year, 136.4% over 3 years and a very large 392.0% over 5 years. This naturally raises questions about risk and potential future returns.\nAlongside these returns, Rambus has been in focus for its role in the semiconductor space, where memory interface and security technology are central topics for investors following chips and data center trends. This context helps explain why the stock has drawn attention during broader discussions about chip demand, capital investment in computing infrastructure and the supporting ecosystem.\nDespite this interest, Rambus currently scores 0 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown in our valuation score . Next we will walk through what traditional valuation methods are saying about the stock today and then finish with a framework that can help you interpret those numbers in a more complete way.\n\nRambus scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Rambus Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company might be worth by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today, so you can compare that value with the current share price.\nFor Rambus, the model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $288.08 million. Analyst inputs and extrapolations point to free cash flow of $301.65 million in 2026 and $480.75 million in 2028, with further projections out to 2035, all expressed in discounted terms to reflect their value in today’s dollars.\n\nWhen these projected cash flows are totaled and adjusted for shareholders, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $72.94 per share. Against a recent share price of around $107.10, this implies the stock is about 46.8% above the DCF estimate. This suggests Rambus currently screens as overvalued on this particular cash flow model.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Rambus may be overvalued by 46.8%.

It helps you gauge how many dollars of share price the market is asking for each dollar of earnings.\nWhat counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on how investors view a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nRambus is currently trading on a P/E of about 50.0x. That is above the Semiconductor industry average of about 44.0x and above the peer group average of about 35.8x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Rambus is 42.5x, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.\nThe Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it weighs those company specific inputs rather than assuming one size fits all. With the current P/E of 50.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 42.5x, Rambus screens as trading above that customized benchmark.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

Millions of investors use them as an easy tool to see whether their Fair Value suggests the stock is priced attractively or richly, and those Narratives update automatically as new earnings, news or other information comes through.\n\nFor Rambus, one investor might set a cautious Narrative with modest revenue growth and a lower fair value than US$107.10. Another might assume stronger growth, higher margins and a fair value above the current price, which shows how the same stock can fit very different approaches.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Rambus?

      "Content": "Has The Recent Arm (ARM) Share Price Jump Created A Valuation Opportunity?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 12:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nIf you are wondering whether Arm Holdings is fairly priced or if the recent buzz has left the stock looking expensive or attractive, this article walks through what the numbers say about its value.\nArm's share price recently closed at US$123.70, with returns of 17.4% over the last 7 days and 10.7% over the last 30 days, while the 1 year return sits at a 23.9% decline and the year to date return is 7.8%.\nRecent attention on Arm has focused on its role as a key semiconductor designer that many chipmakers license. This keeps it in the spotlight whenever investors are thinking about demand for computing and AI related hardware. Coverage has also highlighted how chip related names can see sharp swings in sentiment, which helps explain why Arm's share price can move quickly when expectations shift.\nRight now Arm scores 1 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by its valuation score . In this article we look at what traditional models such as P/E comparisons and discounted cash flow can and cannot tell you about that number, before finishing with a broader way to think about Arm's valuation.\n\nArm Holdings scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Arm Holdings Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes projected future cash flows and discounts them back to today using a required rate of return. The result is an estimate of what the company might be worth based on its potential to generate cash for shareholders.\nFor Arm Holdings, the model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow (FCF) is about $1.16b. Analysts and model estimates project FCF reaching $4.51b by the year ending March 2030, with a path of annual forecasts and extrapolated figures between 2026 and 2035. Simply Wall St uses analyst estimates where available for the earlier years and then extends those trends further out in time.\n\nBringing all of those projected cash flows back to today gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $52.92 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $123.70, the DCF output implies the stock is very expensive, with an intrinsic discount figure that indicates Arm is assessed to be 133.8% overvalued on this model.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Arm Holdings may be overvalued by 133.8%.

Slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower multiple. That context helps you judge whether a current ratio looks stretched or conservative.\n\nArm is currently trading on a P/S ratio of 28.12x. That is well above the Semiconductor industry average of 5.76x and also above the peer average of 9.46x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Arm, which is 41.75x, is a proprietary estimate of what the P/S might be given factors such as Arm’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for those company-specific drivers rather than treating all semiconductor stocks as alike. Since Arm’s actual P/S of 28.12x sits below the Fair Ratio of 41.75x, the multiple-based view points to the shares looking undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

Discover our 22 top founder-led companies .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Arm Holdings Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company connected directly to your assumptions for fair value, future revenue, earnings and margins.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page and let you turn your view on Arm Holdings into a clear forecast. This can then be turned into a fair value that you can compare with today’s price to decide whether the stock looks appealing, fully priced or expensive to you.\n\nBecause Narratives update when new information such as fresh earnings reports or major news comes in, your fair value view can stay aligned with what is happening rather than being stuck in a one off spreadsheet.\nFor example, one Arm Narrative on the Community page might assume stronger revenue growth, higher long term profit margins and a higher fair value. Another might assume more modest growth, lower margins and a lower fair value, showing how two investors can look at the same company and reach very different conclusions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Arm Holdings?

      "Content": "Arm’s Record Q3 Puts AI And Data Center Shift In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 9:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nArm Holdings (NasdaqGS:ARM) reported record Q3 results, with strong contributions from AI and data center related revenues.\nThe company is shifting from a mainly mobile focused business toward a broader AI and compute platform role.\nNew partnerships with large cloud hyperscalers and expanded compute subsystems are gaining traction across customers.\nManagement highlighted increased R&D commitments that support this repositioning in AI and data center markets.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:ARM, the share price sits at $123.7, with a 17.4% gain over the past week and 10.7% over the past month. Over the past year, the stock shows a 23.9% decline, so the recent move comes against a weaker 12 month backdrop. That mix of short term strength and longer term pressure helps frame how the market is reacting to Arm's Q3 news and changing business profile.\nLooking ahead, the key questions are how durable AI and data center demand will be for Arm, and how quickly new compute subsystems and hyperscaler partnerships translate into broader revenue streams. The company is putting clear emphasis on R&D and deeper platform engagement with players like AWS, NVIDIA and Microsoft. These initiatives may influence where Arm ultimately fits within evolving compute architectures.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Arm Holdings by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Arm Holdings.\nHow Arm Holdings stacks up against its biggest competitors\nArm's record Q3 shows how quickly its business mix is tilting toward AI and data center workloads, with revenue of US$1.24b versus US$983m a year earlier and royalty and licensing activity supported by higher value architectures and pre integrated compute subsystems. For you as an investor, the key shift is that Arm is moving from a mainly smartphone royalty story to a broader compute platform that competes more directly with CPU ecosystems from Intel, AMD and emerging RISC V designs across cloud, edge and automotive use cases.\n\nArm Holdings narrative, from mobile IP vendor to AI compute platform The latest results fit neatly into existing narratives that Arm is leveraging its large customer base and developer community to extend into data centers, edge AI and physical AI applications such as robotics and self driving systems. At the same time, earlier narrative flags about patent expirations in the 2030s, high R&D intensity and SoftBank's control are still part of the story, so this pivot toward higher value AI centric products can be seen as an attempt to deepen monetization per chip rather than radically expand the customer count.\n\nStory Continues\nRisks and rewards investors should keep in mind Q3 revenue of US$1.24b and nine month revenue of US$3.43b show that Arm is already operating at scale in AI focused segments, with data center royalties and higher rate products contributing meaningfully.\nExpanded partnerships with hyperscalers such as AWS, NVIDIA and Microsoft, and traction for compute subsystems, give Arm more ways to participate as customers move to custom silicon and AI specific chips.\nNet income in Q3 moved from US$252m to US$223m even as revenue rose, hinting that higher R&D and go to market spending could weigh on margins while the new AI and data center businesses mature.\nManagement and analysts still point to risks around smartphone exposure, memory chip shortages, competition from RISC V and geopolitical issues, which could limit how smooth this business model shift proves to be.\n\nWhat to watch next From here, it will be important to see whether AI and data center royalties continue to gain share of Arm's overall mix, and whether higher R&D spending starts to show up in sustained profit growth rather than just top line momentum. You can keep track of how different investors are interpreting this shift and how it ties into longer term expectations by checking community narratives for Arm on the company’s dedicated page , especially as new guidance, product launches and hyperscaler roadmaps are announced through 2026.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.
