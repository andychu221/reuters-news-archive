      "Content": "Don't Count Them Out Yet: Why International ETFs Could Still Outperform in 2026\n\nMatthew Benjamin, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 12:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nINTC\n\nI once worked with a seasoned investment advisor who liked to say that when American stocks zig, international stocks tend to zag. It sounds a bit simplistic, but in fact, there's a lot of truth to it.\nU.S. stocks tend to outperform international stocks for long stretches, and then the trend reverses. Of course, this inverse relationship is not rock solid. In global recessions, for example, most countries' major stock indexes suffer declines.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nBut aside from that, there are concrete reasons the two groups -- U.S. equities and non-U.S. equities -- often take turns outperforming. The U.S. economy is the world's largest, and the dollar is the global reserve currency. In addition, U.S. equities account for some 65% of global market capitalization. So with the U.S. stock market so large, the two groups of equities tend to act as counterweights to each other.\nRecently, international stocks have outperformed. In 2025, non-U.S. developed market stocks, as measured by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEMKT: VEA) , returned 35.2%. Emerging market stocks, as measured by the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VWO) , returned 25.6%.\n\nBoth crushed the U.S. stock market, which rose 17.7%, as measured by the S&P 500 index . That index is a good proxy for the entire U.S. stock market, as it represents about 80% of total U.S. market value.\nInternational stocks' outperformance has continued in 2026 So far in 2026, that trend has continued. VEA, which excludes U.S. equities, is up 9.2% year to date. VWO is up 8.1%, and the S&P 500 index has climbed just 1.5%. I believe that international equities -- both in advanced and developing economies -- can and will continue to thrive this year. Why?\nFirst, there's the declining dollar. It fell about 9% last year (against a basket of trade partner currencies ). A weaker dollar means more favorable exchange rates for non-U.S. economies, boosting them and their stock markets. That trend should continue, as the current U.S. administration is in fact encouraging the weakening of the greenback.\n\"I think it's great,\" President Donald Trump said on Jan. 27 about the weakening greenback. \"I think the value of the dollar -- look at the business we're doing. The dollar's doing great.\"\n\nStory Continues\nThere's also the impending end of Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve Chair, which will happen in early May. Powell has been very prudent with interest rate cuts. In fact, in January, the Fed's rate-setting committee declined to cut the Fed's target rate, despite intense pressure from the White House to do so. If Trump's nominee to replace Powell is more willing to ease monetary policy, it's likely that the dollar's decline will accelerate this year, as global capital drifts toward countries with higher interest rates.\n\nEuropean stocks are also rallying on a massive uptick in defense spending on the continent. The Trump administration has demanded that NATO allies spend more on their own defense, and they've begun to do just that, stimulating their economies and equity markets.\nGerman and South Korean stocks have been stellar Last year, I recommended stocks from two nations in particular: South Korea and Germany . Korean stocks, as measured by the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (NYSEMKT: EWY) , are up 29% year to date, driven by government reforms and political stability. German stocks, as measured by the iShares MSCI Germany ETF (NYSEMKT: EWG) , have climbed a more modest 3.5% so far in 2026, driven partly by government investment.\nBut stocks of both Germany and Korea, in my opinion, will continue to outperform U.S. stocks through 2026. That holds true broadly for non-U.S. advanced nation stocks, as well as many emerging market stocks. For investors seeking exposure to those regions, the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ETF can both serve as convenient, low-cost ways to do so.\n\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF right now?

That's because growth stocks represent those companies capable of increasing their revenue and earnings at a faster pace than the broader market.\nTheir above-average performance is usually rewarded with healthy gains on the stock market, thereby creating substantial gains for investors. If you have $1,000 in investible cash right now after meeting your expenses, saving enough for difficult times, and clearing up your high-interest-rate debt -- and you're looking for market-beating returns -- you can put that money into the two growth stocks discussed in this article (either individually or combined).\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nNvidia: The world's largest company still has a lot of upside to offer You may be wondering why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , the world's largest company with a $4.6 trillion market cap, is on this list of growth stocks capable of doubling your money. The reason is very simple: Nvidia is head and shoulders above its rivals in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nThe company controls 81% of the AI chip market, according to market research firm IDC. Though other companies have been trying to take share away from Nvidia, the company has managed to sustain its dominance, due to its aggressive product-development moves and control over the supply chain.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin AI graphics processing units (GPUs), which will go on sale in the second half of 2026, are expected to reduce AI inference costs by 10x and GPU requirements for model training by 4x, according to the company. Not surprisingly, Nvidia has already lined up major hyperscalers and AI companies, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, as customers for its next-generation processors.\nWith spending by the four major hyperscalers in the U.S. anticipated to jump to a whopping $700 billion in 2026 from $394 billion last year, Nvidia seems to be in a solid position to capitalize on this massive incremental opportunity, with the help of its new chips. Also, the performance gains Nvidia is promising suggest it could indeed sustain its terrific share of the AI chip market.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia's stature in AI chips means that it can sustain the outstanding growth in its data center business in the long run. RBC Capital Markets expects the AI chip market to grow by 2.5x in size by 2028, generating $550 billion in annual revenue. Nvidia's current market share suggests it could generate well over $400 billion in AI chip revenue over the next three years, which is probably why analysts are bullish on its earnings-growth potential.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's earnings in the recently concluded fiscal 2026 reportedly increased by 57% to $4.69 per share. The chart above suggests that its bottom-line growth is on track to improve this year, followed by another solid jump in the next one. Such solid earnings growth is likely to be rewarded with strong gains on the market, especially considering that Nvidia stock is trading at an attractive 24 times forward earnings.\n\nInvestors looking to buy a growth stock trading at an attractive valuation can consider buying Nvidia, as it has the potential to double from current levels and even reach a $10 trillion market cap in the next five years.\nSeagate Technology: Booming memory demand and an attractive valuation point toward more gains Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) stock has jumped by a whopping 183% in the past six months. This stunning surge has been driven by favorable conditions in the data storage market, where demand for storage solutions, such as hard-disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs), is booming, thanks to AI.\nSeagate released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the three months ended Jan. 2, 2026) on Jan. 28. The company's revenue increased by 21% year over year to $2.82 billion. However, its non-GAAP earnings rose an impressive 53% year over year. The big jump in Seagate's bottom line was driven by fatter margins, which can be explained by the favorable pricing environment in storage chips.\n\nAI data centers have been gobbling up the world's supply of HDD and SSD storage so that they can store the huge datasets needed for AI model training and inference applications. This explains the average increase of 46% in HDD prices over the past four months, according to one estimate. The prices of SSDs, on the other hand, have also taken off and are reportedly costing 16x more than HDDs, as reported by Tom's Hardware last month.\nAn important thing to note here is that enterprise HDD capacity is reportedly sold out for the next two years. The good news for Seagate investors is that AI-fueled storage demand is anticipated to clock an annual growth rate of 23% through 2030, according to Mordor Intelligence, creating a $76 billion addressable opportunity by the end of the decade.\nSeagate should be able to sustain strong levels of earnings and revenue growth in the long run, which explains why analysts have raised their growth expectations.\nWhat's more, the stock trades at 9.5 times sales right now, which isn't all that expensive when compared to the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple of 8.3. The slightly higher valuation seems justified, as Seagate's growth is poised to significantly exceed the average growth of S&P 500 companies.\n\nThere's a good chance of Seagate stock maintaining its premium valuation in the future as the memory market surges higher on the back of AI-fueled demand, and that could pave the way for significant upside in this AI stock. Even if Seagate trades at 12 times sales after three years and achieves the $16.1 billion in revenue that analysts expect, its market cap could hit $194 billion -- just over double its current market cap.\nInvestors can therefore consider buying this growth stock before it skyrockets further.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Brightline Dumps $20 Million in Eos Energy Amid Staggering 117% Stock Surge\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: EOSE\n\n^GSPC\n\nVSAT\n\nCSTM\n\nDAN\n\nOn February 13, 2026, Brightline Capital Management, LLC reported selling out its entire position in Eos Energy Enterprises (NASDAQ:EOSE) , divesting 1,754,000 shares in a transaction estimated at $19.98 million.\nWhat happened According to a SEC filing dated February 13, 2026, Brightline Capital Management, LLC sold its entire holding in Eos Energy Enterprises (NASDAQ:EOSE) , disposing of 1,754,000 shares. The quarter-end position value dropped by $19.98 million.\nWhat else to know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: VSAT: $72.16 million (29.2% of AUM)\nNYSE: AMTM: $40.37 million (16.3% of AUM)\nNYSE: CSTM: $34.72 million (14.0% of AUM)\nNYSE: DAN: $27.23 million (11.0% of AUM)\nNYSE: FLR: $22.15 million (9.0% of AUM)\nAs of February 12, 2026, shares of EOSE were priced at $10.79, up 117.1% over the past year and outperforming the S&P 500 by 104.2 percentage points.\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 2026-02-12)\n$10.79\nMarket Capitalization\n$3 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$63.46 million\nNet Income (TTM)\n($1.12 billion)\n\nCompany snapshot Eos Energy Enterprises designs and manufactures stationary battery storage solutions, primarily the Eos Znyth DC battery system, targeting grid-scale energy storage applications.\nThe company generates revenue by providing battery systems and related services to utility, commercial, industrial, and renewable energy sectors.\nIt serves utilities, commercial and industrial operators, and renewable energy developers seeking scalable, long-duration energy storage solutions.\nEos Energy Enterprises, Inc. is a leading provider of grid-scale battery storage systems, leveraging proprietary zinc-based technology to address the needs of large-scale energy storage. With a focus on innovative, long-duration storage solutions, Eos Energy aims to support the transition to renewable energy by enabling reliable, flexible power delivery for utilities and large energy users. Its competitive edge lies in its differentiated battery chemistry and its ability to serve a broad range of customers in the evolving energy landscape.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors Big winners sometimes force very hard decisions, and when a position doubles in a year, trimming or exiting can say more about portfolio construction than conviction.\n\nEos recently posted its highest quarterly revenue ever at $30.5 million, double the prior quarter and nearly 35 times the year-ago period. Management reaffirmed full-year revenue guidance of $150 million to $160 million and expanded its commercial pipeline to $22.6 billion with $644.4 million in backlog. That is real momentum.\n\nBut the income statement still tells a tougher story. Third-quarter gross loss totaled $33.9 million, and adjusted EBITDA remained negative at $52.7 million. Against that backdrop, a $19.98 million exit after a 117% one-year rally looks like discipline. The remaining portfolio skews toward industrials, materials, and infrastructure names, suggesting a preference for cash-generating cyclicals over capital-intensive energy storage bets.\n\nLong-term investors should focus less on the trade and more on execution. If Eos converts backlog into profitable growth, the story compounds. If not, volatility will stay part of the package.\n\nStory continues\nShould you buy stock in Eos Energy Enterprises right now?

But the growing hyperscaler debt pile has raised concerns about their lack of investor protections compared to other bonds.\n\"What stands ‌out is what’s missing,\" said Julia Khandoshko, ⁠the CEO of Cyprus-based broker Mind Money. \"Once a big name gets covenant-light terms through, others will try the same.\"\n\"Naturally, that creates a second-market problem, where the next buyer has fewer 'rules' ⁠to rely on, while prices will swing more on rates, mood, and liquidity,\" she added.\n\nInvestment-grade borrowers with strong credit profiles typically include fewer covenants in debt agreements than their junk-rated counterparts.\nYet most include basic investor guardrails, especially a standard change-in-control covenant protecting ​investors ​in the event of M&A or another change in ownership. ​Alphabet's bonds do not carry these protections, noted ‌Anthony Canales, head of global research at New York-based Covenant Review.\nThe five major AI hyperscalers - Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft , and Oracle - issued $121 billion in U.S. corporate bonds last year, according to a January report by BofA Securities.\nAlphabet and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment, while Oracle, Meta and Microsoft declined to comment.\nOracle's $25 billion note offering on February 2, and Meta's $30 billion bond offering in October, similarly lacked change-in-control and other basic covenants, Canales noted.\n\n\"In most IG ‌covenant packages you would expect to see a change-in-control covenant,\" Canales ​said. \"But these are huge companies where the investors don't believe there's great ​risk they'll need these protections.\"\nFuture tech issuers, especially ​smaller and lower-rated companies, could run into obstacles if they attempt to model their covenants ‌after Alphabet, he added.\n\nStory Continues\nNew debt issuance in 2026 ​from the five major hyperscalers ​could reach more than $300 billion as their spending needs around AI buildout increase, BofA Securities analyst Tom Curcurro wrote in a January 12 report.\n\"This massive AI infrastructure buildout requires so much capex from the hyperscalers ​that they want to reduce the technical ‌impact on their bonds,\" said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst at the New York-based research firm CreditSights, ​noting the benefits to issuers from flexible covenant structures.\n\"I wouldn’t expect there to be any real ​covenant protections.\"\n(Reporting by Matt Tracy in WashingtonEditing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This approach mirrors a strategy Musk previously suggested for Tesla Inc.\n\nThe rocket and satellite maker is also reportedly adding members to its board of directors to help guide the IPO process and advance Musk's space ambitions beyond the company's core businesses.\nThe deliberations are ongoing, and IPO details could still change.\nSpaceX aims to hold its blockbuster IPO later this year in a deal that could raise up to $50 billion. The funds would support ambitious projects including AI data centers in space and a factory on the moon. The company recently expanded its portfolio by acquiring Musk's xAI, moving beyond rockets and satellites into artificial intelligence.\nDual-class share structures are common among U.S. technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. These arrangements are typically presented as enabling founders to focus on long-term vision without short-term shareholder pressure.\n\nWith super-voting shares, Musk would create protection against activist shareholders pushing for changes against his wishes. The billionaire has previously advocated for this approach at Tesla , where he proposed creating a dual class of shares to secure at least 25% voting control, threatening to develop his AI and robotics products elsewhere if unable to achieve that level of influence.\nRelated articles\nSpaceX reportedly mulls dual-class share structure for upcoming IPO\nAs Claude disrupts stock market, Anthropic researcher warns ’world is in peril’\nMorgan Stanley CIO survey: Why AI hype isn’t boosting 2026 IT budgets\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Crypto Crash: Is Bitcoin Still the Best Cryptocurrency to Buy After This Sell-Off?\n\nAlex Carchidi, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nA crash is rarely a verdict on an asset's future. Frequently enough, it isn't even a verdict on much of anything other than how panicked some investors were at a specific period in time.\nOn that note, on Feb. 5, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) crashed by around 14% before recovering in the following days, and the broader crypto market shed enormous value in the same window. But does that mean Bitcoin's tenure as the best cryptocurrency to buy is now definitively over, or is it just as appealing as ever for those who are patient?\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nThe causes for this sell-off are a bit of a mystery First, let's unpack why Bitcoin fell so much, because there isn't yet a cohesive narrative on the subject.\nIn short, this downswing appears to be more like a cascade of selling prompted by somewhat opaque financial actions rather than being the result of a Bitcoin-specific problem.\nOn Feb. 5, there was a mix of cross-asset selling pressure in crypto, and a few large liquidations in crypto derivatives markets, which happened around the same time as outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . On that day alone, Bitcoin ETFs reported $297 million in capital outflows, on top of $635 million in outflows that happened on Feb. 4.\n\nOne plausible mechanism is that Bitcoin was serving as collateral for leveraged trading by a hedge fund or large capital holder somewhere in the financial system, and was then sold off when that player's other positions went bad. That kind of forced selling can drag down even high-quality assets, and, in this case, it might have sparked a stampede out the door once the sell-off picked up speed, exacerbating the problem significantly.\nBut nothing changed about Bitcoin's investment thesis with the crash, regardless of its cause.\nThis coin is still a top buy Same as always, Bitcoin's core advantage as an asset is that its new supply keeps shrinking on a fairly predictable schedule. No government can ever print more of it.\nThat thesis only pays off in the long run if enough investors keep choosing Bitcoin as a store of value. But the coin now has more on-ramps for capital (like the ETFs) than ever, and a larger base of long-term holders who have already lived through worse. The coin's habit is to survive deep drawdowns and then recover.\nThe biggest long-term risk is the coin's cryptography. Bitcoin transactions rely on digital signatures, and there's a chance that in the next decade, sufficiently powerful quantum computers could eventually threaten the security of those signatures.

      "Content": "Crypto Crash: Is Bitcoin Still the Best Cryptocurrency to Buy After This Sell-Off?\n\nAlex Carchidi, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nA crash is rarely a verdict on an asset's future. Frequently enough, it isn't even a verdict on much of anything other than how panicked some investors were at a specific period in time.\nOn that note, on Feb. 5, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) crashed by around 14% before recovering in the following days, and the broader crypto market shed enormous value in the same window. But does that mean Bitcoin's tenure as the best cryptocurrency to buy is now definitively over, or is it just as appealing as ever for those who are patient?\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nThe causes for this sell-off are a bit of a mystery First, let's unpack why Bitcoin fell so much, because there isn't yet a cohesive narrative on the subject.\nIn short, this downswing appears to be more like a cascade of selling prompted by somewhat opaque financial actions rather than being the result of a Bitcoin-specific problem.\nOn Feb. 5, there was a mix of cross-asset selling pressure in crypto, and a few large liquidations in crypto derivatives markets, which happened around the same time as outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . On that day alone, Bitcoin ETFs reported $297 million in capital outflows, on top of $635 million in outflows that happened on Feb. 4.\n\nOne plausible mechanism is that Bitcoin was serving as collateral for leveraged trading by a hedge fund or large capital holder somewhere in the financial system, and was then sold off when that player's other positions went bad. That kind of forced selling can drag down even high-quality assets, and, in this case, it might have sparked a stampede out the door once the sell-off picked up speed, exacerbating the problem significantly.\nBut nothing changed about Bitcoin's investment thesis with the crash, regardless of its cause.\nThis coin is still a top buy Same as always, Bitcoin's core advantage as an asset is that its new supply keeps shrinking on a fairly predictable schedule. No government can ever print more of it.\nThat thesis only pays off in the long run if enough investors keep choosing Bitcoin as a store of value. But the coin now has more on-ramps for capital (like the ETFs) than ever, and a larger base of long-term holders who have already lived through worse. The coin's habit is to survive deep drawdowns and then recover.\nThe biggest long-term risk is the coin's cryptography. Bitcoin transactions rely on digital signatures, and there's a chance that in the next decade, sufficiently powerful quantum computers could eventually threaten the security of those signatures. Nonetheless, there are already discussions underway about shoring up the network's defenses.\n\nStory Continues\nSo is Bitcoin still the best cryptocurrency to buy right now? Probably yes, though be aware that if you buy right now, there could still be more downside ahead, given how depressed sentiment about the asset is at the moment. And if you do buy, learn how to store crypto safely so that you'll know what you need to keep your coins safe for the long haul.\n\nShould you buy stock in Bitcoin right now?

      "Content": "$20 Million Exit: Why Academy Sports' $1.4 Billion Third Quarter Likely Wasn't Enough\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:17 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ASO\n\nCENX\n\n^GSPC\n\nBKE\n\nHUN\n\nOn February 13, 2026, Impala Asset Management reported selling out its entire stake in Academy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) , with an estimated transaction value of $19.86 million.\nWhat happened According to an SEC filing dated February 13, 2026, Impala Asset Management LLC exited its entire position in Academy Sports and Outdoors, selling 397,115 shares. The fund reported no ASO shares held at quarter-end, with the net position value shifting by $19.86 million over the period.\nWhat else to know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: CENX: $33.61 million (22.7% of AUM)\nNYSE: ERO: $26.95 million (18.2% of AUM)\nNYSE: BKE: $21.37 million (14.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: HUN: $8.67 million (5.9% of AUM)\nNYSE: WHR: $7.94 million (5.4% of AUM)\nAs of February 12, 2026, shares of Academy Sports and Outdoors were priced at $57.73, up 10.9% over the past year and underperforming the S&P 500 by 2.03 percentage points.\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$6.01 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$376.71 million\nDividend yield\n0.88%\nPrice (as of market close February 12, 2026)\n$57.73\n\nCompany snapshot Academy Sports and Outdoors operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer in the United States. The company operates retail locations in over a dozen contiguous states and offers private label brands such as Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, Outdoor Gourmet, and Freely.\nWhat this transaction means for investors When a concentrated metals-focused portfolio reallocates nearly $20 million away from a specialty retailer, that tells you something about conviction and opportunity cost.\n\nAcademy reported third-quarter net sales of $1.38 billion, up 3%, with diluted EPS climbing 14% to $1.05. Gross margin expanded to 35.7% from 34.0%, and operating income improved to $100.4 million. That’s solid execution. Yet year-to-date net income sits at $243.1 million, down 14.6% from last year, and comparable sales remain negative.\n\nWithin a portfolio where Century Aluminum alone commands over 20% of assets and copper producer ERO and retailer Buckle are top positions, Academy’s consumer exposure may have looked less asymmetric. The fund appears tilted toward commodity leverage and cyclical upside rather than steady retail comp stabilization.\n\nFor long-term investors, Academy’s story is evolving. Store growth continues, eCommerce jumped 22.2%, and guidance was narrowed rather than slashed. But when capital concentrates elsewhere, it often reflects a view on macro positioning more than company fundamentals.\n\nShould you buy stock in Academy Sports And Outdoors right now?

(NYSE: QXO) rallied 15.6% this week through 1:35 p.m. EDT Friday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .\nQXO is the building materials distribution company helmed by entrepreneur Brad Jacobs, who founded QXO in June 2024 with the strategy of acquiring building products distribution companies in order to consolidate the large and fragmented industry. It's a strategy he perfected previously in the construction equipment rental industry with United Rentals (NYSE: URI) and the logistics industry with XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) .\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nThis week, QXO announced its second major acquisition as part of that effort. And while acquiring companies often go down with the announcement of a significant acquisition, in this case, investors cheered the move, given that acquisitions are a central part of QXO's strategy.\nQXO buys Kodiak On Wednesday, QXO announced the acquisition of Kodiak Building Partners for $2.25 billion, consisting of $2.0 billion in cash and 13.2 million QXO shares. What's interesting about the deal is that QXO also has the right to buy back those 13.2 million shares at $40, which is nearly double the $23.21 stock price at which QXO closed on Tuesday.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nHealth Minister Marjorie Michel tables the 2024-2025 Canada Health Act Annual Report in Parliament\n\nCNW Group\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:12 AM PST 3 min read\n\nOTTAWA, ON , Feb. 13, 2026 /CNW/ - Today, the Honourable Marjorie Michel, Minister of Health, tabled the 2024-2025 Canada Health Act Annual Report in Parliament. Developed by the Government of Canada in collaboration with provincial and territorial (PT) governments, the Report provides information on the federal administration of the Canada Health Act (CHA) and the extent to which PT health care insurance plans have fulfilled its requirements.\n\nUpholding the Act is critical to protecting Canadian health care and the values that sustain it. The federal government has taken a collaborative approach with all PTs to ensure all Canadians continue to have equitable access to medically necessary care based on their medical needs, not their ability to pay.\nThe Government of Canada remains committed to the principles of the CHA, which are linked to federal payments to PTs under the Canada Health Transfer (CHT). If a PT permits patient charges for medically necessary services, a mandatory dollar-for-dollar deduction must be taken from the jurisdiction's CHT. PTs that face these deductions can be reimbursed through the CHA Reimbursement Policy if they work with Health Canada on a plan to eliminate patient charges and their underlying causes, and then implement that plan within two years of the deduction having been taken.\n\nIn 2025-26, PTs will receive $54.7 billion through the CHT, an increase of 5% over the 2024-25 transfer of $52.1 billion.

Developed by the Government of Canada in collaboration with provincial and territorial (PT) governments, the Report provides information on the federal administration of the Canada Health Act (CHA) and the extent to which PT health care insurance plans have fulfilled its requirements.\n\nUpholding the Act is critical to protecting Canadian health care and the values that sustain it. The federal government has taken a collaborative approach with all PTs to ensure all Canadians continue to have equitable access to medically necessary care based on their medical needs, not their ability to pay.\nThe Government of Canada remains committed to the principles of the CHA, which are linked to federal payments to PTs under the Canada Health Transfer (CHT). If a PT permits patient charges for medically necessary services, a mandatory dollar-for-dollar deduction must be taken from the jurisdiction's CHT. PTs that face these deductions can be reimbursed through the CHA Reimbursement Policy if they work with Health Canada on a plan to eliminate patient charges and their underlying causes, and then implement that plan within two years of the deduction having been taken.\n\nIn 2025-26, PTs will receive $54.7 billion through the CHT, an increase of 5% over the 2024-25 transfer of $52.1 billion. By 2026-27, the CHT is set to grow by an additional 5% to over $57 billion.\nToday's report covers deductions from fiscal year 2024-25 and reimbursements for prior years.

Email pr@fool.com\n\nFull Conference Call Transcript David M. Sedgwick: Thanks, Lauren. Good morning. I want to first acknowledge our dear friend, William M. Wagner, who officially retired a few weeks ago. CareTrust REIT, Inc. would not be what it is without Bill. He helped establish a strong foundation on which we are poised for success, and our future achievements will be a tribute to his many contributions. We wish him well in his much-deserved retirement and caution him to take it easy on the Oreo cookies and the pizza. It is a marathon, Bill, not a sprint. Alright. Thank you for joining us as we reflect on the incredible year that was 2025 and our plans to keep the flywheel ripping for years to come.\n\nSimply put, 2025 was a transformational year for CareTrust REIT, Inc. Starting the year, we were a team of 21 coming off the most active investment year of our history, by a factor of five, punctuated by our largest single transaction to that point, which we closed at the end of 2024. Our portfolio consisted predominantly of triple-net leased skilled nursing facilities with a handful of net-lease senior housing assets and a loan book. In 2024, we had grown the equity market cap 74% to $5.1 billion. But we are never satisfied. So even though the company was running at a record pace, we believed two things.\nOne, we had another gear in us, and two, we needed to do some strategic heavy lifting to position the company to scale for the long term. So we got to work. Doubling our team of professionals, adding firepower throughout the organization, and bringing in-house other areas like tax and data science, and we executed. Acquiring Care REIT, including their team, to enter the UK care home market and closing on our first SHOP deal after methodically evaluating many opportunities, large and small, along the way. Our collective efforts led to total investments of $1.8 billion, surpassing our record 2024 and supporting our 17.3% year-over-year normalized FFO per share growth.\n\nBeyond FFO, we have increased the diversification of our portfolio across geography, asset type, operator, borrower, manager, and payer source, as well as achieving continual improvement in our already strong EBITDAR rent coverage. We ended the year having again grown our market cap by 61% to $8.2 billion. I cannot help but take a moment to thank our shareholders, our board, our operators, our capital and strategic partners, and our entire team for their dedication and hard work. We simply could not have produced the 10-year total shareholder return through year end of approximately 439% without your commitment, professionalism, and sacrifices. I could go on and on about 2025, but really our focus is on 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nThe accelerating momentum from 2024 to 2025 and the resulting growth has only stoked the hunger and motivation everyone at CareTrust REIT, Inc. feels to make 2026 another great year. Today, the skilled nursing operating environment is stable and largely supportive across most states, and the senior housing environment in both the US and UK is also stable and gaining strength in many markets. We hit the ground running in 2026. We do it with a CareTrust REIT, Inc. team that is deeper and more capable than any time in our history, and we are now running with the two additional growth engines of UK care homes and SHOP.\n\nAnd yet, the start of this year feels very much like déjà vu all over again. What do I mean? What I mean is like 12 months ago, we are coming off another record year. Our operators continue to set the standard for portfolio lease coverage. We continue to have access to capital and a fortress balance sheet, and we again have high hopes for a substantial year of external growth. And we still feel the same urgency and hunger to grow long-term shareholder value.\nAnd our mission remains the same: to be a unique healthcare REIT that is by operators for operators, making disciplined investments in assets and operators who can change the world of senior housing and care in a big way. With that, I will now turn it over to James. No pressure, my friend. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJames B. Callister: During the fourth quarter, we completed approximately $562 million of investments, including our first SHOP deal, which involves three communities in Texas totaling 270 assisted living and memory care units. We are excited to partner with Sinceri Senior Living, who will help manage those communities for us. Fourth quarter investments included about $84 million of loans with the majority toward the skilled nursing sector, approximately $27 million to acquire two senior housing communities triple-net leased to an established operator, the remainder comprising the acquisition of 14 skilled nursing facilities across three transactions. Overall, the blended stabilized yield on fourth quarter investments was 8.8%.\nSince year end, we have closed on another approximately $215 million of investments, including the acquisition of six skilled nursing facilities in the Mid-Atlantic, at a strong going-in rent coverage, leased to a quality operator in a new relationship for CareTrust REIT, Inc., and two care homes in the UK net leased to an existing operator. As we look forward, our investment pipeline remains strong, sitting at approximately $500 million. The quoted pipeline is approximately half UK care homes, a third skilled nursing, one small SHOP deal, and the remainder a combination of loans and senior housing triple net. It includes some singles and doubles as well as some mid to large-size portfolio transactions.\n\nPlease remember that when we quote our pipeline, we only include opportunities where we have a reasonable level of confidence that we can lock up and close within the next 12 months, and it does not always include larger portfolios that we are reviewing. Our investment pipeline remains robust, supported by a balanced mix of broker transactions and proprietary opportunities generated through established operator relationships and other strategic channels. We continue to see consistent deal flow across all sectors, encompassing triple-net and SHOP structures alongside a steady and meaningful increase in overall transaction activity, particularly within seniors housing and the care home market.\nWe are seeing the most competition in SHOP where cap rates continue to compress as investors seek more exposure to the sector to benefit from operating trends. Having said that, we are still finding SHOP opportunities that excite us, and we are benefiting from our strategic push in the UK and through our solid pipeline of skilled nursing deals. Our disciplined underwriting framework, combined with a strong focus on long-term operator partnerships and a commitment to creative, collaborative transaction structuring, will continue to drive sustainable growth across the skilled nursing, senior housing, and UK care home sectors. With that, I will now turn it over to Derek to review our quarterly financial results.\n\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, James. For the fourth quarter, normalized FFO increased 42.7% over the prior quarter to $104.1 million, and normalized FAD increased 38.7% to $103 million. On a per-share basis, normalized FFO increased $0.07, or 17.5%, to $0.47 per share, and normalized FAD increased $0.05, or 12.2%, to $0.46 per share. For the full year, normalized FFO per share increased $0.26, or 17.3%, to $1.76 per share\nJames B. Callister: and normalized FAD increased $0.22, or 14.3%, to $1.76 per share.\nDerek J. Bunker: During the fourth quarter, we sold 6.5 million shares on a forward basis at an average price of $37.30 for gross proceeds of approximately $242.5 million. After year end, we sold another 3.5 million shares on a forward basis for gross proceeds of $129.5 million, for a current total of $372 million of gross proceeds pending from unsettled equity forward contracts outstanding under the ATM program. We anticipate using proceeds from these sales to fund our acquisition pipeline. In yesterday's press release, we provided initial guidance for fiscal year 2026 of normalized FFO per share of $1.90 to $1.95, and normalized FAD per share of $1.90 to $1.95, the midpoints of which each represent a year-over-year increase of 9.4%.\n\nIn addition to the assumptions detailed in our release yesterday, I will note that our guidance does not assume any new investments, dispositions, debt repayments, and debt or equity issuances beyond those announced to date. Since we do not assume additional investments in our guidance, we assume the equity forward contracts will settle at year end. Lastly, our liquidity continues to remain strong. In addition to approximately $100 million of cash on hand as of 02/11/2026, we have full capacity available on our $1.2 billion revolver.\nAnd despite a record pace of investments, we continue to maintain low leverage with net debt to EBITDA of 0.7 times, net debt to enterprise value of 3.7%, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 10.5 times.\nJames B. Callister: Each as of year end.\n\nDerek J. Bunker: With that, I will turn it back to Dave. Thanks, Derek. We hope our report has been helpful to you, and thank you for your continued support. We would be happy to answer your questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press 1 again. Please pick up your handset when asking a question. If you are muted locally, please remember to unmute your device. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Farrell Granath with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. And\nFarrell Granath: I guess I will just start it off with your guidance and expectations for the pipeline going forward. I know you have added that there has been some additional competition at least in the SHOP area. But I am curious if you can elaborate on the opportunity set on these larger portfolios, specifically in SHOP. Now that you have entered into deals with your recent acquisition, is it seemingly easier to have these conversations? Are you having more inbound, especially on these larger portfolios?\n\nJames B. Callister: Yeah. Hey, Farrell. This is James. I mean, I think that the inbounds, I think, are pretty consistent. SHOP deals are typically pretty heavily marketed. So I think you see a pretty wide range of large and small deals that come through. I think our view is we want to look at all of it. Right? I think that\nDavid M. Sedgwick: we want to be able to look at large and small and see the best, most risk-adjusted path to get us to a low double-digit IRR. I think we look at both. Like I said, they are pretty heavily marketed, even the larger ones. So I think we see just about everything that comes in, and I think the brokers have definitely gotten word of our interest in SHOP and know, I would be pretty surprised, shocked if a meaningful deal was out there that had not come across our desk.\n\nFarrell Granath: Thank you. And also in your commentary around specifically SNFs reaching record levels of coverage and now looking forward to 2026, I am curious how sustainable do you think these coverage levels are as well as just framing the current market environment headlines when it comes to Medicare Advantage and how you are just viewing SNFs in the market.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Yeah. Thanks, Farrell. The skilled nursing environment right now I think is in a really good place. Speaking with our operators very recently, that is the sentiment that we get from them. Labor is in a much better place than it has been in recent history. The states, regulatory, reimbursement-wise, things feel really good. And our operators are really anxious to seize the moment and get back into growth mode. So we feel like if you look at our portfolio, you look at the coverage, you know, our occupancy is right around 79%, 80%. So there is still room, quite a bit of upside for our operators as that number increases, to offset the inevitable headwinds.\n\nThere is always going to be headwinds in skilled nursing every year. There is always something. But with great operators and beefy coverage, you can at least, we believe, manage through any of that.\nFarrell Granath: Great. Thank you very much.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thanks, Farrell.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wesley Golladay with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thank you. Hey. Hey, everyone. You did make some data analytics hires\nWesley Golladay: earlier in the year. Can you talk about what they are focused on at the beginning? Are they mainly targeting senior housing operations? Or is it more so for the acquisitions of all segments?\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Yeah. So the investment in the data science team right now is prioritized on building out our SHOP capabilities, building out that platform, but ultimately, that team is going to have an impact across the whole organization, making us more efficient, making us smarter. We are already seeing it, and we really like what we see. We will continue to invest in that department.\n\nWesley Golladay: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thanks, Wes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Albert Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nMichael Albert Carroll: James, can you provide us some details on the pipeline right now? Of that $500 million, like what is\nMichael Albert Carroll: the break out between care homes, SHOP, and skilled nursing facility deals?\nMichael Albert Carroll: Yeah. Mike, I would say of that $500 million right now, I think like I kind of put in the prepared remarks, it is about half UK care homes right now, about a third, I would say, US skilled nursing, and the rest is a combination of, you know, a SHOP deal, triple-net seniors, and a couple small loans in there.\n\nMichael Albert Carroll: I am sorry. I forgot that you said that. Can you, I know you kind of highlighted this earlier, but just on the competitive landscape that you are seeing within this space, I mean, is it any more competitive in specific property types? Like, are you seeing it being more competitive in SHOP, SNFs, UK care homes? Or is it kind of similar across the board?\nJames B. Callister: You know, I would say of the three segments, I think that SHOP is definitely the most competitive. I think you have the most capital pursuing deals. So I think you see definitely the most interest based on groups wanting to get in on the operating trends. But I think that we still feel like there are SHOP deals out there that really excite us. I feel like with our cost of capital, we can be really competitive.\n\nAnd as we really pour through just about everything that comes in and wanting to look at, you know, deals that we think can get us through different paths to that low double-digit IRR, we feel like when we find those deals that really intrigue us despite the competition, that we can pounce and go get the deals we really want.\nMichael Albert Carroll: And then if you look at the cap rates for each individual property type, how much do they typically vary? I know that you did about high eights, I guess, the fourth quarter and to date. Like, if you are looking at more UK care homes and SHOP deals, I mean, should we expect that yield to dip a little bit lower? And just kind of off of that, when you are quoting those cap rates do you include the tax leakage on the UK care homes, or do we need to make sure that we think about that when we are putting our numbers out there?\n\nJames B. Callister: I will defer to Derek. I think we do quote post-tax, but I mean, the SNF yields are going to be the same that they have been historically. I mean, if it is a really large portfolio deal or with incredible coverage, we might dip, you know, a teeny below what we normally do, but SNF deals are still going to be in the nines.\nDerek J. Bunker: SHOP\nJames B. Callister: cap rates, Mike, are definitely compressing, so every deal is a little different. There is just a wider band range of cap rates in seniors depending on how old the vintage is, the CapEx needs, the location, the age, all those kinds of things. In UK, I mean, it is typically going to be pre-tax mid-eights\nDerek J. Bunker: to higher.\nJames B. Callister: Post-tax mid-sevens to higher.\n\nMichael Albert Carroll: Great. I appreciate it.\nDerek J. Bunker: On the blended deal, we typically\nDerek J. Bunker: typically do not exclude the impact of the withholding tax in the UK when giving a blended stabilized yield.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, you have already done $215 million to start the year. You have got $500 million in the pipeline.\nMichael Goldsmith: So over $700 million. At this point last year, you were at $350 million. You know, you started the call talking about how 2025 was a bit déjà vu of 2024 with the growth. But I guess just given where you are set up, like, how confident are you that we will be talking about next year, we will be talking about déjà vu all again given the strong growth and investment opportunities.\n\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Oh, I love a crystal ball question, Mike. I will answer it this way. I think we felt really, really good going into 2025. We felt like the table was set to have another big year, and the difference going into this year is I just feel better about it. Because now the difference is our team is deeper and more capable, and we have the UK and the SHOP TAMs to play in as well. So as long as there are some meaningful, you know, chunky-type opportunities out there, we should be really competitive,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: and\nDavid M. Sedgwick: we certainly have the potential, if those deals materialize, to have another really substantial year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, being a SNF REIT and seeing the operational intensity that comes with skilled nursing and dealing with SNF operators, does that give you an advantage as you enter SHOP? How much different is there in identifying skilled nursing operators versus SHOP operators?\n\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thanks for that question. We do think that our operating DNA and deep experience is helpful. It certainly informs how we underwrite. It certainly informs how we vet operators and how we asset manage. I think it provides a deeper level across the board. And I see, and I think you see, that manifested in our lease coverage. You know that? That really is a symbol of choosing the right operators, underwriting the deals properly. And there is a lot that we carry over from vetting skilled operators with choosing seniors as well. Thank you very much. Good luck in 2026. Thanks a lot. Your next\nOperator: question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Thanks for the time.\nMichael Goldsmith: Just curious, as you have expanded your opportunities set with UK care homes and SHOP, if you look at, one, UK SHOP or IDA transactions, and two, if you consider doing development at some point in seniors housing recognizing you are larger and can maybe wear the initial dilution, I would imagine some of the growing operators are looking to development as a source of opportunities. So curious on your stance on those two.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Great question. I think on the first, as we look at the UK,\nMichael Goldsmith: the\nDavid M. Sedgwick: operator relationships that we have right now are eager to grow with us, and they have expressed a desire to\nDerek J. Bunker: to continue to, you know, to do deals with us in a triple-net basis. I think that there will be, as you look in the future, there is going to be opportunities probably to apply our SHOP platform to the UK. So I would never say never on that, and I would say it is probably more likely than not in years to come. So the second part of your question was development, and I think, yeah, there is going to be, I think what we would like to do there is de-risk to the market instead of being at risk.\n\nSo right now, generally, you know, it still does not pencil to do anything in a significant way here in the United States with respect to development.\nMichael Goldsmith: But there could be\nDerek J. Bunker: certain circumstances, certain opportunities that do. And on a limited basis for the right operator, for the right location, I think we would take a hard look at that.\nMichael Goldsmith: Great. Thanks. Since you kind of noted getting a new operating partner in the Mid-Atlantic with the recent transaction, I am not sure if you feel comfortable naming that operator, or you could just give us a little color on that group and if it was related in any way to the Integra transaction that one of your peers announced.\nJames B. Callister: Yeah. I mean, I do not think we have a problem announcing it. They have released their own press releases, Juan. So it is a group known as Miller Group, but I do not think they are affiliated with anything else anybody has announced. If you are referencing Sabra, it is not Sabra.\n\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you.\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, Juan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyak with Green Street. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJames B. Callister: Thanks, and good morning. Can you maybe just talk about your underwriting\nMichael Albert Carroll: criteria within SHOP and whether that has changed at all due to the increased competition, either at the property level or just in terms of IRR requirements, or are you just passing on more deals than maybe\nJames B. Callister: you would have, call it, three to six months ago? I mean, we definitely noticed the compression in cap rates. I think that we still look to get an unlevered IRR in the low double digits. And we look at every deal to see what that deal's path is to get us there and what we think the pricing will be. So, I mean, I do not think we just look at it in one box and say, you know, we have to have, you know, a seven going in, and it has to look exactly like this to get us there.\n\nI think we are going to look at it given the compression in the market and the cap rates, and we are going to look at what is this deal's path to get us to that low double digit. And how realistic is it? Right? If it is in lease-up, if it does or does not need CapEx, what its position is in the market, what is the revenue versus expense growth look like. So I think you look at all of that in the same way we always\nDerek J. Bunker: have.\nJames B. Callister: I think that we take expected pricing into account for sure, and it impacts how we see us getting to that double-digit IRR. But, you know, maybe some deals trade a little too expensive to get us there, but that has always been the case a little bit. So I do not think it has changed much of the underwriting. I think it has just changed the path we see as getting to the low double-digit IRR we are looking for.\n\nMichael Albert Carroll: Got it. Makes sense.\nJames B. Callister: Maybe one additional question. Just\nMichael Albert Carroll: given pretty minimal leverage today,\nJames B. Callister: how are you thinking about funding future external growth? And at what point do you think it would make sense to use some balance sheet capacity instead of equity issuances?\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, Mike. You know, I think more of the same as we have approached over the past year or two. Really just piggybacking off Dave’s comments. It feels like we are positioned really well. Capital markets have been favorable. I think as rates have come down, you know, using the balance sheet is a balance between looking at where our equity is trading and a little bit more on the\n\nJonathan Hughes: revolver side. And I think there will be a point where we start to carry a little bit there, maybe then look toward the bond market, especially as we fully realize the IG savings that we think we can get. But we just feel like we are in a multiyear sort of inflection of getting bigger deals and bigger opportunities, and so we want to make sure we have got really full capacity and full availability, whether that is debt or equity.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, Mike. Thanks.\nLauren Beale: Your next question\nOperator: comes from the line of Austin Todd Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJames B. Callister: Yeah. These\nMichael Goldsmith: you referenced some of the hiring that you have done this past year, and I am just wondering, you know, for any potential larger transactions, do you feel like you have the platform and people in place to digest that? Or do you think it would come with, you know, adding additional\n\nJames B. Callister: folks to kind of help oversee that effort, you know, maybe particularly within SHOP, which is a little bit of a newer segment for you.\nDerek J. Bunker: Yeah. I think the answer to that is really going to be relative\nDavid M. Sedgwick: to the circumstances of the deal, the size of it, the complexity of it, whether or not the team, or part of a team, would come with it,\nDerek J. Bunker: those are all things that we throw into the\nDavid M. Sedgwick: mix to figure out how to get a big deal done. The team here is\nDerek J. Bunker: pound for pound, in my opinion, the best and the most capable to do all sorts of things. But there still are going to be some deals,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: like the UK care home acquisition last year, Care REIT, where it came with some really talented people, and we decided to keep. So it is all going to be relative to the circumstances of the particular deal.\n\nAustin Todd Wurschmidt: Helpful. And then just one on the loan book. I mean, it seems like kind of the competition in the lending markets these days has picked up a little bit. I mean, any risk of loan prepayments that you foresee or any conversations you are having on that front?\nMichael Goldsmith: Well,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: you know, the loan strategy that we put in place a few years ago has\nDerek J. Bunker: wildly exceeded our expectations and helped\nDavid M. Sedgwick: fuel real growth, real acquisition of real estate that either came with or because of those loans and relationships that we developed. I think as things get more competitive as banks kind of jump back into the space, those relationships are still very active with us. It is still looking at off-market opportunities with those relationships. And so I think that is still going to be, going forward,\n\nDerek J. Bunker: a really unique and powerful\nDavid M. Sedgwick: mode of growth for us,\nDerek J. Bunker: maybe a little bit less\nDavid M. Sedgwick: than it has been in the past if banks continue to get really aggressive, but we are looking still, not included in that pipeline number, at some larger deals that are off-market with some of these strategic partners of ours. And\nDerek J. Bunker: you know, if we get some loans paid back,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: that will just fuel additional growth because that pipeline continues to reload.\nAustin Todd Wurschmidt: Thank you. Thanks, Austin.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to David M. Sedgwick, CEO, for closing remarks.\nDerek J. Bunker: Well, we are really grateful for everybody's interest and support. If you have follow-ups, you know where to find us. Have a great day.\n\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for attending.

Email pr@fool.com\n\nFull Conference Call Transcript David M. Sedgwick: Thanks, Lauren. Good morning. I want to first acknowledge our dear friend, William M. Wagner, who officially retired a few weeks ago. CareTrust REIT, Inc. would not be what it is without Bill. He helped establish a strong foundation on which we are poised for success, and our future achievements will be a tribute to his many contributions. We wish him well in his much-deserved retirement and caution him to take it easy on the Oreo cookies and the pizza. It is a marathon, Bill, not a sprint. Alright. Thank you for joining us as we reflect on the incredible year that was 2025 and our plans to keep the flywheel ripping for years to come.\n\nSimply put, 2025 was a transformational year for CareTrust REIT, Inc. Starting the year, we were a team of 21 coming off the most active investment year of our history, by a factor of five, punctuated by our largest single transaction to that point, which we closed at the end of 2024. Our portfolio consisted predominantly of triple-net leased skilled nursing facilities with a handful of net-lease senior housing assets and a loan book. In 2024, we had grown the equity market cap 74% to $5.1 billion. But we are never satisfied. So even though the company was running at a record pace, we believed two things.\nOne, we had another gear in us, and two, we needed to do some strategic heavy lifting to position the company to scale for the long term. So we got to work. Doubling our team of professionals, adding firepower throughout the organization, and bringing in-house other areas like tax and data science, and we executed. Acquiring Care REIT, including their team, to enter the UK care home market and closing on our first SHOP deal after methodically evaluating many opportunities, large and small, along the way. Our collective efforts led to total investments of $1.8 billion, surpassing our record 2024 and supporting our 17.3% year-over-year normalized FFO per share growth.\n\nBeyond FFO, we have increased the diversification of our portfolio across geography, asset type, operator, borrower, manager, and payer source, as well as achieving continual improvement in our already strong EBITDAR rent coverage. We ended the year having again grown our market cap by 61% to $8.2 billion. I cannot help but take a moment to thank our shareholders, our board, our operators, our capital and strategic partners, and our entire team for their dedication and hard work. We simply could not have produced the 10-year total shareholder return through year end of approximately 439% without your commitment, professionalism, and sacrifices. I could go on and on about 2025, but really our focus is on 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nThe accelerating momentum from 2024 to 2025 and the resulting growth has only stoked the hunger and motivation everyone at CareTrust REIT, Inc. feels to make 2026 another great year. Today, the skilled nursing operating environment is stable and largely supportive across most states, and the senior housing environment in both the US and UK is also stable and gaining strength in many markets. We hit the ground running in 2026. We do it with a CareTrust REIT, Inc. team that is deeper and more capable than any time in our history, and we are now running with the two additional growth engines of UK care homes and SHOP.\n\nAnd yet, the start of this year feels very much like déjà vu all over again. What do I mean? What I mean is like 12 months ago, we are coming off another record year. Our operators continue to set the standard for portfolio lease coverage. We continue to have access to capital and a fortress balance sheet, and we again have high hopes for a substantial year of external growth. And we still feel the same urgency and hunger to grow long-term shareholder value.\nAnd our mission remains the same: to be a unique healthcare REIT that is by operators for operators, making disciplined investments in assets and operators who can change the world of senior housing and care in a big way. With that, I will now turn it over to James. No pressure, my friend. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJames B. Callister: During the fourth quarter, we completed approximately $562 million of investments, including our first SHOP deal, which involves three communities in Texas totaling 270 assisted living and memory care units. We are excited to partner with Sinceri Senior Living, who will help manage those communities for us. Fourth quarter investments included about $84 million of loans with the majority toward the skilled nursing sector, approximately $27 million to acquire two senior housing communities triple-net leased to an established operator, the remainder comprising the acquisition of 14 skilled nursing facilities across three transactions. Overall, the blended stabilized yield on fourth quarter investments was 8.8%.\nSince year end, we have closed on another approximately $215 million of investments, including the acquisition of six skilled nursing facilities in the Mid-Atlantic, at a strong going-in rent coverage, leased to a quality operator in a new relationship for CareTrust REIT, Inc., and two care homes in the UK net leased to an existing operator. As we look forward, our investment pipeline remains strong, sitting at approximately $500 million. The quoted pipeline is approximately half UK care homes, a third skilled nursing, one small SHOP deal, and the remainder a combination of loans and senior housing triple net. It includes some singles and doubles as well as some mid to large-size portfolio transactions.\n\nPlease remember that when we quote our pipeline, we only include opportunities where we have a reasonable level of confidence that we can lock up and close within the next 12 months, and it does not always include larger portfolios that we are reviewing. Our investment pipeline remains robust, supported by a balanced mix of broker transactions and proprietary opportunities generated through established operator relationships and other strategic channels. We continue to see consistent deal flow across all sectors, encompassing triple-net and SHOP structures alongside a steady and meaningful increase in overall transaction activity, particularly within seniors housing and the care home market.\nWe are seeing the most competition in SHOP where cap rates continue to compress as investors seek more exposure to the sector to benefit from operating trends. Having said that, we are still finding SHOP opportunities that excite us, and we are benefiting from our strategic push in the UK and through our solid pipeline of skilled nursing deals. Our disciplined underwriting framework, combined with a strong focus on long-term operator partnerships and a commitment to creative, collaborative transaction structuring, will continue to drive sustainable growth across the skilled nursing, senior housing, and UK care home sectors. With that, I will now turn it over to Derek to review our quarterly financial results.\n\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, James. For the fourth quarter, normalized FFO increased 42.7% over the prior quarter to $104.1 million, and normalized FAD increased 38.7% to $103 million. On a per-share basis, normalized FFO increased $0.07, or 17.5%, to $0.47 per share, and normalized FAD increased $0.05, or 12.2%, to $0.46 per share. For the full year, normalized FFO per share increased $0.26, or 17.3%, to $1.76 per share\nJames B. Callister: and normalized FAD increased $0.22, or 14.3%, to $1.76 per share.\nDerek J. Bunker: During the fourth quarter, we sold 6.5 million shares on a forward basis at an average price of $37.30 for gross proceeds of approximately $242.5 million. After year end, we sold another 3.5 million shares on a forward basis for gross proceeds of $129.5 million, for a current total of $372 million of gross proceeds pending from unsettled equity forward contracts outstanding under the ATM program. We anticipate using proceeds from these sales to fund our acquisition pipeline. In yesterday's press release, we provided initial guidance for fiscal year 2026 of normalized FFO per share of $1.90 to $1.95, and normalized FAD per share of $1.90 to $1.95, the midpoints of which each represent a year-over-year increase of 9.4%.\n\nIn addition to the assumptions detailed in our release yesterday, I will note that our guidance does not assume any new investments, dispositions, debt repayments, and debt or equity issuances beyond those announced to date. Since we do not assume additional investments in our guidance, we assume the equity forward contracts will settle at year end. Lastly, our liquidity continues to remain strong. In addition to approximately $100 million of cash on hand as of 02/11/2026, we have full capacity available on our $1.2 billion revolver.\nAnd despite a record pace of investments, we continue to maintain low leverage with net debt to EBITDA of 0.7 times, net debt to enterprise value of 3.7%, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 10.5 times.\nJames B. Callister: Each as of year end.\n\nDerek J. Bunker: With that, I will turn it back to Dave. Thanks, Derek. We hope our report has been helpful to you, and thank you for your continued support. We would be happy to answer your questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press 1 again. Please pick up your handset when asking a question. If you are muted locally, please remember to unmute your device. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Farrell Granath with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. And\nFarrell Granath: I guess I will just start it off with your guidance and expectations for the pipeline going forward. I know you have added that there has been some additional competition at least in the SHOP area. But I am curious if you can elaborate on the opportunity set on these larger portfolios, specifically in SHOP. Now that you have entered into deals with your recent acquisition, is it seemingly easier to have these conversations? Are you having more inbound, especially on these larger portfolios?\n\nJames B. Callister: Yeah. Hey, Farrell. This is James. I mean, I think that the inbounds, I think, are pretty consistent. SHOP deals are typically pretty heavily marketed. So I think you see a pretty wide range of large and small deals that come through. I think our view is we want to look at all of it. Right? I think that\nDavid M. Sedgwick: we want to be able to look at large and small and see the best, most risk-adjusted path to get us to a low double-digit IRR. I think we look at both. Like I said, they are pretty heavily marketed, even the larger ones. So I think we see just about everything that comes in, and I think the brokers have definitely gotten word of our interest in SHOP and know, I would be pretty surprised, shocked if a meaningful deal was out there that had not come across our desk.\n\nFarrell Granath: Thank you. And also in your commentary around specifically SNFs reaching record levels of coverage and now looking forward to 2026, I am curious how sustainable do you think these coverage levels are as well as just framing the current market environment headlines when it comes to Medicare Advantage and how you are just viewing SNFs in the market.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Yeah. Thanks, Farrell. The skilled nursing environment right now I think is in a really good place. Speaking with our operators very recently, that is the sentiment that we get from them. Labor is in a much better place than it has been in recent history. The states, regulatory, reimbursement-wise, things feel really good. And our operators are really anxious to seize the moment and get back into growth mode. So we feel like if you look at our portfolio, you look at the coverage, you know, our occupancy is right around 79%, 80%. So there is still room, quite a bit of upside for our operators as that number increases, to offset the inevitable headwinds.\n\nThere is always going to be headwinds in skilled nursing every year. There is always something. But with great operators and beefy coverage, you can at least, we believe, manage through any of that.\nFarrell Granath: Great. Thank you very much.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thanks, Farrell.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wesley Golladay with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thank you. Hey. Hey, everyone. You did make some data analytics hires\nWesley Golladay: earlier in the year. Can you talk about what they are focused on at the beginning? Are they mainly targeting senior housing operations? Or is it more so for the acquisitions of all segments?\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Yeah. So the investment in the data science team right now is prioritized on building out our SHOP capabilities, building out that platform, but ultimately, that team is going to have an impact across the whole organization, making us more efficient, making us smarter. We are already seeing it, and we really like what we see. We will continue to invest in that department.\n\nWesley Golladay: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thanks, Wes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Albert Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nMichael Albert Carroll: James, can you provide us some details on the pipeline right now? Of that $500 million, like what is\nMichael Albert Carroll: the break out between care homes, SHOP, and skilled nursing facility deals?\nMichael Albert Carroll: Yeah. Mike, I would say of that $500 million right now, I think like I kind of put in the prepared remarks, it is about half UK care homes right now, about a third, I would say, US skilled nursing, and the rest is a combination of, you know, a SHOP deal, triple-net seniors, and a couple small loans in there.\n\nMichael Albert Carroll: I am sorry. I forgot that you said that. Can you, I know you kind of highlighted this earlier, but just on the competitive landscape that you are seeing within this space, I mean, is it any more competitive in specific property types? Like, are you seeing it being more competitive in SHOP, SNFs, UK care homes? Or is it kind of similar across the board?\nJames B. Callister: You know, I would say of the three segments, I think that SHOP is definitely the most competitive. I think you have the most capital pursuing deals. So I think you see definitely the most interest based on groups wanting to get in on the operating trends. But I think that we still feel like there are SHOP deals out there that really excite us. I feel like with our cost of capital, we can be really competitive.\n\nAnd as we really pour through just about everything that comes in and wanting to look at, you know, deals that we think can get us through different paths to that low double-digit IRR, we feel like when we find those deals that really intrigue us despite the competition, that we can pounce and go get the deals we really want.\nMichael Albert Carroll: And then if you look at the cap rates for each individual property type, how much do they typically vary? I know that you did about high eights, I guess, the fourth quarter and to date. Like, if you are looking at more UK care homes and SHOP deals, I mean, should we expect that yield to dip a little bit lower? And just kind of off of that, when you are quoting those cap rates do you include the tax leakage on the UK care homes, or do we need to make sure that we think about that when we are putting our numbers out there?\n\nJames B. Callister: I will defer to Derek. I think we do quote post-tax, but I mean, the SNF yields are going to be the same that they have been historically. I mean, if it is a really large portfolio deal or with incredible coverage, we might dip, you know, a teeny below what we normally do, but SNF deals are still going to be in the nines.\nDerek J. Bunker: SHOP\nJames B. Callister: cap rates, Mike, are definitely compressing, so every deal is a little different. There is just a wider band range of cap rates in seniors depending on how old the vintage is, the CapEx needs, the location, the age, all those kinds of things. In UK, I mean, it is typically going to be pre-tax mid-eights\nDerek J. Bunker: to higher.\nJames B. Callister: Post-tax mid-sevens to higher.\n\nMichael Albert Carroll: Great. I appreciate it.\nDerek J. Bunker: On the blended deal, we typically\nDerek J. Bunker: typically do not exclude the impact of the withholding tax in the UK when giving a blended stabilized yield.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, you have already done $215 million to start the year. You have got $500 million in the pipeline.\nMichael Goldsmith: So over $700 million. At this point last year, you were at $350 million. You know, you started the call talking about how 2025 was a bit déjà vu of 2024 with the growth. But I guess just given where you are set up, like, how confident are you that we will be talking about next year, we will be talking about déjà vu all again given the strong growth and investment opportunities.\n\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Oh, I love a crystal ball question, Mike. I will answer it this way. I think we felt really, really good going into 2025. We felt like the table was set to have another big year, and the difference going into this year is I just feel better about it. Because now the difference is our team is deeper and more capable, and we have the UK and the SHOP TAMs to play in as well. So as long as there are some meaningful, you know, chunky-type opportunities out there, we should be really competitive,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: and\nDavid M. Sedgwick: we certainly have the potential, if those deals materialize, to have another really substantial year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, being a SNF REIT and seeing the operational intensity that comes with skilled nursing and dealing with SNF operators, does that give you an advantage as you enter SHOP? How much different is there in identifying skilled nursing operators versus SHOP operators?\n\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Thanks for that question. We do think that our operating DNA and deep experience is helpful. It certainly informs how we underwrite. It certainly informs how we vet operators and how we asset manage. I think it provides a deeper level across the board. And I see, and I think you see, that manifested in our lease coverage. You know that? That really is a symbol of choosing the right operators, underwriting the deals properly. And there is a lot that we carry over from vetting skilled operators with choosing seniors as well. Thank you very much. Good luck in 2026. Thanks a lot. Your next\nOperator: question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Thanks for the time.\nMichael Goldsmith: Just curious, as you have expanded your opportunities set with UK care homes and SHOP, if you look at, one, UK SHOP or IDA transactions, and two, if you consider doing development at some point in seniors housing recognizing you are larger and can maybe wear the initial dilution, I would imagine some of the growing operators are looking to development as a source of opportunities. So curious on your stance on those two.\nDavid M. Sedgwick: Great question. I think on the first, as we look at the UK,\nMichael Goldsmith: the\nDavid M. Sedgwick: operator relationships that we have right now are eager to grow with us, and they have expressed a desire to\nDerek J. Bunker: to continue to, you know, to do deals with us in a triple-net basis. I think that there will be, as you look in the future, there is going to be opportunities probably to apply our SHOP platform to the UK. So I would never say never on that, and I would say it is probably more likely than not in years to come. So the second part of your question was development, and I think, yeah, there is going to be, I think what we would like to do there is de-risk to the market instead of being at risk.\n\nSo right now, generally, you know, it still does not pencil to do anything in a significant way here in the United States with respect to development.\nMichael Goldsmith: But there could be\nDerek J. Bunker: certain circumstances, certain opportunities that do. And on a limited basis for the right operator, for the right location, I think we would take a hard look at that.\nMichael Goldsmith: Great. Thanks. Since you kind of noted getting a new operating partner in the Mid-Atlantic with the recent transaction, I am not sure if you feel comfortable naming that operator, or you could just give us a little color on that group and if it was related in any way to the Integra transaction that one of your peers announced.\nJames B. Callister: Yeah. I mean, I do not think we have a problem announcing it. They have released their own press releases, Juan. So it is a group known as Miller Group, but I do not think they are affiliated with anything else anybody has announced. If you are referencing Sabra, it is not Sabra.\n\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you.\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, Juan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyak with Green Street. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJames B. Callister: Thanks, and good morning. Can you maybe just talk about your underwriting\nMichael Albert Carroll: criteria within SHOP and whether that has changed at all due to the increased competition, either at the property level or just in terms of IRR requirements, or are you just passing on more deals than maybe\nJames B. Callister: you would have, call it, three to six months ago? I mean, we definitely noticed the compression in cap rates. I think that we still look to get an unlevered IRR in the low double digits. And we look at every deal to see what that deal's path is to get us there and what we think the pricing will be. So, I mean, I do not think we just look at it in one box and say, you know, we have to have, you know, a seven going in, and it has to look exactly like this to get us there.\n\nI think we are going to look at it given the compression in the market and the cap rates, and we are going to look at what is this deal's path to get us to that low double digit. And how realistic is it? Right? If it is in lease-up, if it does or does not need CapEx, what its position is in the market, what is the revenue versus expense growth look like. So I think you look at all of that in the same way we always\nDerek J. Bunker: have.\nJames B. Callister: I think that we take expected pricing into account for sure, and it impacts how we see us getting to that double-digit IRR. But, you know, maybe some deals trade a little too expensive to get us there, but that has always been the case a little bit. So I do not think it has changed much of the underwriting. I think it has just changed the path we see as getting to the low double-digit IRR we are looking for.\n\nMichael Albert Carroll: Got it. Makes sense.\nJames B. Callister: Maybe one additional question. Just\nMichael Albert Carroll: given pretty minimal leverage today,\nJames B. Callister: how are you thinking about funding future external growth? And at what point do you think it would make sense to use some balance sheet capacity instead of equity issuances?\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, Mike. You know, I think more of the same as we have approached over the past year or two. Really just piggybacking off Dave’s comments. It feels like we are positioned really well. Capital markets have been favorable. I think as rates have come down, you know, using the balance sheet is a balance between looking at where our equity is trading and a little bit more on the\n\nJonathan Hughes: revolver side. And I think there will be a point where we start to carry a little bit there, maybe then look toward the bond market, especially as we fully realize the IG savings that we think we can get. But we just feel like we are in a multiyear sort of inflection of getting bigger deals and bigger opportunities, and so we want to make sure we have got really full capacity and full availability, whether that is debt or equity.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nDerek J. Bunker: Thanks, Mike. Thanks.\nLauren Beale: Your next question\nOperator: comes from the line of Austin Todd Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJames B. Callister: Yeah. These\nMichael Goldsmith: you referenced some of the hiring that you have done this past year, and I am just wondering, you know, for any potential larger transactions, do you feel like you have the platform and people in place to digest that? Or do you think it would come with, you know, adding additional\n\nJames B. Callister: folks to kind of help oversee that effort, you know, maybe particularly within SHOP, which is a little bit of a newer segment for you.\nDerek J. Bunker: Yeah. I think the answer to that is really going to be relative\nDavid M. Sedgwick: to the circumstances of the deal, the size of it, the complexity of it, whether or not the team, or part of a team, would come with it,\nDerek J. Bunker: those are all things that we throw into the\nDavid M. Sedgwick: mix to figure out how to get a big deal done. The team here is\nDerek J. Bunker: pound for pound, in my opinion, the best and the most capable to do all sorts of things. But there still are going to be some deals,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: like the UK care home acquisition last year, Care REIT, where it came with some really talented people, and we decided to keep. So it is all going to be relative to the circumstances of the particular deal.\n\nAustin Todd Wurschmidt: Helpful. And then just one on the loan book. I mean, it seems like kind of the competition in the lending markets these days has picked up a little bit. I mean, any risk of loan prepayments that you foresee or any conversations you are having on that front?\nMichael Goldsmith: Well,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: you know, the loan strategy that we put in place a few years ago has\nDerek J. Bunker: wildly exceeded our expectations and helped\nDavid M. Sedgwick: fuel real growth, real acquisition of real estate that either came with or because of those loans and relationships that we developed. I think as things get more competitive as banks kind of jump back into the space, those relationships are still very active with us. It is still looking at off-market opportunities with those relationships. And so I think that is still going to be, going forward,\n\nDerek J. Bunker: a really unique and powerful\nDavid M. Sedgwick: mode of growth for us,\nDerek J. Bunker: maybe a little bit less\nDavid M. Sedgwick: than it has been in the past if banks continue to get really aggressive, but we are looking still, not included in that pipeline number, at some larger deals that are off-market with some of these strategic partners of ours. And\nDerek J. Bunker: you know, if we get some loans paid back,\nDavid M. Sedgwick: that will just fuel additional growth because that pipeline continues to reload.\nAustin Todd Wurschmidt: Thank you. Thanks, Austin.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to David M. Sedgwick, CEO, for closing remarks.\nDerek J. Bunker: Well, we are really grateful for everybody's interest and support. If you have follow-ups, you know where to find us. Have a great day.\n\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.\nShould you buy stock in CareTrust REIT right now?

Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nWith a significant portion of this spending already locked in through data center permits, power contracts, and supply agreements, core AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are likely to benefit from the near-term demand.\n\nHere's why stocks of these two companies can go parabolic in the coming years.\nNvidia Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, refers to AI as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" The company estimates global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of 2030. With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects. This revenue growth trajectory can become even steeper if the company's backlog converts as expected or faster, and it has a few new multiyear client wins.\nHence, Broadcom can see parabolic growth even at current elevated valuation levels.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire?

With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects.

      "Content": "2 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nINTC\n\nGOOG\n\nWall Street may argue all about the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, but big tech's spending plans in global AI infrastructure are too large to ignore, right now. Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms expect to collectively spend roughly $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up about 60% year over year.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nWith a significant portion of this spending already locked in through data center permits, power contracts, and supply agreements, core AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are likely to benefit from the near-term demand.\n\nHere's why stocks of these two companies can go parabolic in the coming years.\nNvidia Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, refers to AI as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history.\" The company estimates global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of 2030. With a full-stack AI platform that includes hardware, software, and enterprise platforms and an annual product cadence (releasing new upgrades and architectures each year), the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\nIn 2026, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting Nvidia's Blackwell B200 systems, which the company claims deliver up to 30x higher inference (real-time model deployment) performance and better power efficiency than the prior-generation H100 chips. The company is also focusing on selling rack-scale solutions such as GB200 NVL72 \"AI factory\" systems, which bundle CPUs, GPUs, networking interconnects, and supporting software into complete AI server solutions, instead of stand-alone chips. This transition can eventually boost average selling prices and the company's margins.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, the company has introduced the Vera Rubin system, a six-chip platform designed to deliver even higher performance and power efficiency than Blackwell systems for complex AI and agentic AI workloads. With Vera Rubin currently in full production, the company expects to launch these systems in the second half of 2026. Management has highlighted cumulative revenue visibility for Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin systems of over $500 billion from the start of 2025 through the end of 2026.\nConsidering these tailwinds, Nvidia's stock may soar in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is also a major beneficiary of the increasing enterprise and hyperscaler spending on custom chips and high-speed networking in AI data centers.\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, hyperscalers are increasingly deploying custom AI server chips for specialized AI training and real-time deployment workloads. Broadcom is estimated to account for almost 60% share of this market by 2027.\nThat growing adoption is already translating into a multiyear backlog. Broadcom exited fiscal 2025 (ending Nov. 2, 2025) with a consolidated backlog of $162 billion, of which custom AI chips accounted for $73 billion to be delivered over the next 18 months. The company's networking switches are also seeing increased demand in AI data centers, as evidenced by the over $10 billion AI switch backlog at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nBroadcom reported a 65% year-over-year jump in AI revenues to $20 billion, driven by demand for custom chips, high-speed networking, and optical interconnects. This revenue growth trajectory can become even steeper if the company's backlog converts as expected or faster, and it has a few new multiyear client wins.\nHence, Broadcom can see parabolic growth even at current elevated valuation levels.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Tech Boom & Defense Backlogs: 2 Sectors Poised to Outperform in 2026\n\nUrmimala Biswas\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 11:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nLMT\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently projected global GDP growth of approximately 3.3% for 2026, reflecting steady expansion supported in part by continued corporate investment in digital infrastructure and advanced technologies. Labor market data further supports this resilience. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently reported that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 in January 2026, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.3%. The labor force participation rate was 62.5%, signaling a broadly stable employment environment.\n\nWithin this macro backdrop, hiring momentum remains firm across aerospace and defense, technology and digital services, with electronics among the faster-growing segments.\nAs per Deloitte’s recent industry projection report, the global semiconductor industry is expected to reach $975 billion in annual sales in 2026, a historic peak fueled by an intensifying AI infrastructure boom.\nTaken together, steady global growth, resilient labor markets and sustained technology investment create a constructive setting for equity markets. In this environment, AI-linked infrastructure and healthcare innovation stand out as two sectors offering clear earnings visibility and structural support heading into mid-2026.\nBelow are the two sectors that we expect to outperform the broader market this year, supported by strong demand drivers and favorable earnings momentum.\n\nTechnology - AI Infrastructure & Semiconductors AI-driven capital expenditure remains a core earnings catalyst in 2026. Hyperscalers, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, continue allocating substantial budgets toward AI data centers and cloud infrastructure.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association projects global semiconductor sales to approach $1 trillion in 2026, implying 26% industry growth, driven primarily by advanced logic and high-bandwidth memory tied to generative AI workloads. This underpins earnings visibility for GPU and accelerator suppliers such as NVIDIA NVDA and foundry leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor TSM. Equipment vendors, including ASML ASML and Applied Materials AMAT, also benefit from leading-edge node expansion. While TSM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NVDA, ASML and AMAT carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nMean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIndustrials – Aerospace, Defense & Electrification The industrial sector is supported by sustained defense spending, commercial aerospace backlog strength and accelerating electrification investment. U.S. national defense spending has remained above $800 billion annually in recent fiscal years, providing multi-year revenue visibility for prime contractors. This supports substantial funded backlogs at companies such as Lockheed Martin LMT, which exited 2025 with a record $194 billion backlog and RTX, which reported a $268 billion backlog, signaling extended revenue streams. LMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nBeyond aerospace and defense, electrification and grid modernization remain powerful structural drivers. Companies such as Eaton and Siemens continue to highlight data center power demand, transmission upgrades and energy transition investments as key growth catalysts. Collectively, these factors provide tangible backlog visibility and earnings support heading into mid-2026.\n\nMean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Trump's team has responded that any decision isn't final, but this potential concession would be the latest among more than half a dozen moves to lower tariffs over the past three months.\nThe changes range from a reduction of food tariffs to a deescalation of tensions with trading partners to new tariff plans with exclusions so wide that they are expected to have little impact on consumers' pocketbooks.\nThe administration's shift in its tariff approach has been apparent since last November, when affordability emerged as a potent political issue that led to Republican election losses that month.\nAnd these moves have already had some apparent effects. Friday's cooler-than-expected inflation reading saw some politically sensitive food prices in decline.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nWhat impact are tariff adjustments having on inflation rates?\n\nHow have tariffs evolved over the past three months?\n\nWhat products could see price relief from tariff changes?\n\nWhy is Trump considering reducing steel and aluminium tariffs?\n\nThe price of coffee — a key area of White House focus — fell 0.9% between December and January. Similarly in focus have been prices for beef and veal, with those prices down by 0.4% over the same stretch. That came as the overall Consumer Price Index showed a price increase of 0.2% in January from a month earlier.",

This comparison breaks down their key differences in cost, performance, risk, and portfolio makeup to help investors decide which may better fit their strategy.\nSnapshot (cost & size) Metric\nISCV\nIJJ\nIssuer\nIShares\nIShares\nExpense ratio\n0.06%\n0.18%\n1-yr return (as of 2026-02-04)\n13.3%\n9.8%\nDividend yield\n1.9%\n1.7%\nBeta\n1.19\n1.12\nAUM\n$609.2 million\n$8.3 billion\n\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year monthly returns.

Top positions include US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE:USFD) , Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE:RS) , and Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA) . The fund’s 25.5-year track record and $8.5 billion in assets under management suggest strong investor interest, with no notable quirks or specialty screens.\nISCV, by contrast, covers a much larger small-cap universe with 1,083 holdings. Its sector mix tilts toward Financial Services (21%), Consumer Cyclical (15%), and Industrials (13%). Leading positions are Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) , Alcoa Corp., and Annaly Capital Management REIT Inc. (NYSE:NLY) , providing broader diversification across small companies.\n\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link .\nWhat this means for investors The iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF (IJJ) and the iShares Morningstar Small-Cap Value ETF (ISCV) offer investors exposure to companies of significantly different size. Choosing between them comes down to the individual’s investment goals.\nISCV’s small-cap focus is great for aggressive investors seeking high growth companies, as demonstrated by its higher return over the past year. It also sports a better dividend yield and substantially lower expense ratio.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, investing in small caps comes with greater volatility and risk. This is seen in ISCV’s higher beta and max drawdown. Small cap companies also have limited analyst coverage, and are more vulnerable to business failure. Adding to this is ISCV’s smaller basket of stocks at 305, which can heighten volatility.\n\nIJJ is for investors who want the higher growth potential of mid-cap stocks compared to large caps, but greater stability over small caps. IJJ also sports a much larger AUM than ISCV, providing greater liquidity.\nIJJ’s downsides include its lower growth potential compared to small caps, which is seen in its smaller one-year return, and higher expense ratio. However, its more than one thousand holdings give it great diversification, helping to limit risk.\nUltimately, IJJ is for investors who want a balance between growth and stability, while ISCV is for those seeking high growth.\nShould you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF right now?

      "Content": "2 Consumer Staples Stocks to Buy in February 2026\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:50 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nMO\n\nKO\n\nWith the S&P 500 trading near its all-time highs, investors might be reluctant to buy new stocks. But instead of shunning all stocks, it might be smarter to simply pivot toward defensive consumer staples stocks, which are more resistant to market downturns.\nTwo such evergreen stocks are Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Altria (NYSE: MO) . Both companies are Dividend Kings , which have raised their payouts annually for at least half a century.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nCoca-Cola Coca-Cola, the world's largest beverage company, might seem like a risky stock to buy amid declining soda consumption rates. Yet over the past few decades, the company expanded its portfolio with more brands of bottled water, fruit juices, teas, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and other non-carbonated drinks to offset that pressure. It also refreshed its flagship sodas with new flavors, healthier versions, and smaller serving sizes to attract new customers.\nCoca-Cola only sells the concentrates and syrups for those drinks, while its independent bottling partners manufacture and sell the finished products. That capital-light business model enables Coca-Cola to maintain stable margins and generate plenty of cash to fund its dividends. It pays a forward yield of 2.6% and has raised its dividend for 63 consecutive years.\n\nCoca-Cola's organic revenue rose 5% in 2025, and it expects 4%-5% growth in 2026. That stable outlook makes it a reliable anchor in this choppy market, and it still looks reasonably valued at 25 times forward earnings.\nAltria Altria, the largest tobacco company in America, might also seem like a shaky investment as U.S. smoking rates sink to historic lows. But to offset that pressure, it consistently raises its prices, cuts costs, and repurchases more shares to boost its EPS and support its dividend.\nIt's also selling more smoke-free products -- including e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, and snus -- to reduce its long-term dependence on cigarettes and cigars. It aims to generate at least $5 billion in smoke-free revenues by 2028, and its acquisition of the e-cigarette leader NJOY -- which closed in 2023 -- should accelerate that transformation.\n\nIt pays a hefty forward yield of 6.3%, and it's raised its dividend 60 times over the past 56 years. It generates nearly all its revenue in the U.S., so it's well insulated from currency headwinds.\nAltria's adjusted EPS grew 4% in 2025, and it anticipates 2.5%-5.5% growth in 2026. It trades at just 12 times forward earnings, so it should remain a reliable safe-haven stock this year.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now?

      "Content": "OpenAI Warns Congress on DeepSeek Distillation Tactics\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nOpenAI has cautioned US lawmakers that its Chinese rival DeepSeek may be using increasingly sophisticated distillation tactics to extract outputs from leading American AI systems, potentially intensifying both competitive and national security concerns. In a memo sent Thursday to the House Select Committee on China and reviewed by Bloomberg, OpenAI said DeepSeek relied on distillation techniques as part of what it described as ongoing efforts to free-ride on capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier labs. The company said it detected new, obfuscated methods designed to evade its safeguards, and it previously opened a probe with partner Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) shortly after the R1 model's release last year to assess whether data had been obtained in an unauthorized manner.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nOpenAI's internal review suggests that accounts associated with DeepSeek employees may have attempted to bypass existing guardrails by accessing models through third-party routers to mask their source. The memo also said DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs in programmatic ways, while pointing to networks of unauthorized resellers of OpenAI's services that could have been used to evade controls. Distillation, in which one AI model trains on the outputs of another, has persisted despite enforcement efforts, according to the company. Given that DeepSeek and many other Chinese models do not charge a monthly subscription fee, the spread of such techniques could pose a business risk to US firms that have invested billions in AI infrastructure and monetize through premium services, potentially narrowing what Washington views as a US advantage in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe warning comes amid broader scrutiny of semiconductor policy and export controls. US authorities previously opened a probe into whether DeepSeek circumvented export restrictions by purchasing chips via Singapore, and records obtained by the House China committee show that Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) provided technical support to help improve and co-design the R1 model. The DeepSeek-V3 base model required 2.8 million H800 GPU hours for full training, and those processors were allowed to be sold to China for a few months in 2023 before a later rule halted sales. At the end of last year, President Donald Trump moved to ease certain chip restraints and allow Nvidia to sell its H200 processors, which are about 18 months behind the leading Blackwell versions, a policy shift that some lawmakers have framed as potentially accelerating China's AI progress.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Space exec. weighs in on SpaceX IPO, xAI merger\n\nYahoo Finance Video und Josh Lipton\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:30 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\nAs SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) prepares for a supposed IPO this year after merging with xAI, Xplore COO Lisa Rich comes on Asking for a Trend to discuss the value of Elon Musk's private space venture and what the addition of xAI brings to the table.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLisa, it is good to see you. I hear Lisa, you're coming to us from a Tesla via Starling. So you are all in on the Musk Empire. Uh let's dig into this empire because Lisa, as you know SpaceX\n00:23 Speaker A\nlots of talk, lots of headlines about an IPO. Lisa, you're a SpaceX investor. Your thoughts on this. I I would imagine Lisa, you wouldn't mind seeing a a public debut here.\n00:39 Speaker B\nThank you, Josh. Not at all. And and had I had the opportunity to ask Elon during Davos what his plans were, of course, I would have. Um, at USA House, they had an amazing presence there. Uh, but we've got amazing opportunity here with all the progress that SpaceX has made Starlink, uh, obviously, I wouldn't be talking you to you right now without it. The concept of Starlink, uh connect with all the Teslas and having that integrated would be amazing. So all these properties that Elon has, could you imagine if they're all folded up into one more like the Alphabet uh story which merged Waymo and uh YouTube which were valuable properties in and of themselves. Um, so when we had the private uh story that came out private company of XAI merging with SpaceX, that was huge news, but what happens next? I think is the big question because if you look at all these other properties that uh Elon has launched, all of which are uh making revenue in and of themselves. That's one thing, but his ambitions are huge. They're capital intensive. The idea of going to the moon uh and commercializing that, we're talking about even bigger money that's required, which is why going to the capital markets makes sense at this time and rewarding all of the success that SpaceX has had uh up until this point.\n02:37 Speaker A\nCan I ask you as an investor, how would you go about thinking how to how to value SpaceX, especially after this merger with XAI, like what is the what's the comp, Lisa? Is there a comp? You know, is it tech? Is it aerospace? Um is it one of one? How would you think about that?\n03:00 Speaker B\nWell, I think it's it's, it's adding, you know, one plus one equals five, you know, in this case, but can the market achieve a valuation that's acceptable if they combine forces? Because they're all valuable in and of themselves and if you think about the value in the trillions, um and and of course factoring in the the future plans, um, that's a big question. So is there a comp? No, I don't think there is one. This is really a story of our lifetime right now is uh where we're headed next with uh the financial story and of course, the physical and digital story of what they can accomplish.\n03:42 Speaker A\nAs an investor in SpaceX, Lisa, I'm curious when you saw, okay, they're merging with XAI. Did you look at that Lisa and say, yes, that makes sense. That makes sense financially, that makes sense strategically. It it creates a stronger story overall or did you think it complicates the narrative, walk me through it.\n04:02 Speaker B\nNo, I think XAI and and their plan, which is um the digital side of connectivity for a whole universe that they're trying to build for us. Uh when Elon talked about it in his uh all hands, he said he wanted people to live their life on the app, you know, XAI and they just introduced the money side of this. Um it all flows together and it's um it did make sense to me. Um but now what does it mean for an IPO and the value? Um and and timing? Um not sure uh because the original thought was middle of the summer, I think.\n04:47 Speaker A\nLet me ask you, I I want to get your take on these headlines we saw this week. Um reports of departures of XAI co-founders, um that's coming after it looks like several other founding members too. You know, as an investor, did you look at that, Lisa? Was that, I don't know, is that any kind of red flag to you or no, that's just, hey, that's that's normal scaling going on.\n05:08 Speaker B\nIt wasn't to me because I am a founder and I've I've never scaled something like what Elon has done. However, you go through these stages and the people that you hire at the beginning of the company are not the people that are the skill sets that you necessarily need for scale and growth. So a lot of those folks sit well in that early stage environment, but then when you need to get management in place and larger teams in place, it gets more complicated. So you need people with those skill sets. So it's uh an evolution that does have to happen and he kind of bit the bullet and did it.\n05:51 Speaker A\nLast question, Lisa. I'm I'm curious, you know, as a SpaceX investor and you outlined all these these grand opportunities and ambitious ambitions and and that's why you you saddle up with Elon Musk because he swings for the fences, right? Um, I'm curious though, what were before you put money to work? What were some of the risks you thought about with SpaceX? You know, was it I don't know, was it national security concerns? Was it was it regulatory issues, competition? How how did you frame it?\n06:17 Speaker B\nWell, I would say the the government was a big, one of the biggest challenges for SpaceX because they were going to provide a service but they had to prove they could do it. They had to prove they could do it at a lower cost and then reliably. So they've done that with cargo and then crew missions. Um and now the idea of instead of going to Mars first, going to the moon first. This is this cadence of launch that they've achieved for um getting uh mass to into orbit is so phenomenal. Can they do that uh for the moon and that helps us actually have a reliable uh launch cadence that lowers the price that helps us have a real commercialization story. So there is a commercialization story that's happened with launch today because he's been able to get so many companies to launch. And then as you're thinking about orbital uh data centers in the future, which is huge mass that has to go to launch, that's huge cost. Uh and we need Starship going and regularly. So that's kind of the next phase. So he's proven what he's done. He's faced uh you know, lawsuits and whatever he's had all the all the challenges with constraints with uh government side of things and proven himself. So what if he could prove this again and really enable Artemis and the work that they need to do on the moon and get it to be that commercial story that we've all been hoping for.\n08:14 Speaker A\nLisa, coming to us from a Tesla via Starlink, what better way to talk about all things Musk? Thank you, Lisa, as always.\n\nAGB und Datenschutzerklärung\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 No-Brainer Dividend Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:25 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ET\n\nVZ\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nWhen the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, many investors pivoted from dividend stocks to risk-free CDs and T-bills to earn higher yields. But the Fed cut those rates six times in a row in 2024 and 2025, driving more investors back toward dividend stocks.\nMany analysts expect Kevin Warsh, who could become the next Fed chair this May, to continue cutting rates to spur fresh lending and economic growth. If that happens, it could be smart to buy these two dividend stocks: Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) .\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nEnergy Transfer Energy Transfer, which operates over 140,000 miles of pipeline across 44 states, is one of America's top midstream companies. It charges upstream extraction companies and downstream refining companies \"tolls\" to deliver natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, and other refined products through its pipelines.\nThat business model is well-insulated from volatile commodity prices, since it merely needs those resources to keep flowing through its pipes to generate stable profits. It's also a master limited partnership ( MLP ), which blends a return of capital (which isn't taxed at the capital gains rate unless the underlying position is sold) and its own income to fund its distributions.\n\nEnergy Transfer's evergreen business model, tax-efficient structure, and exposure to soaring energy demand (partly driven by the cloud and AI markets) all make it an attractive investment. It pays a high forward yield of 7.3%, and it looks like a bargain at 12 times forward earnings.\nVerizon Verizon, which serves 146.7 million wireless customers, is one of America's top telecom companies. In recent years, it struggled to gain more wireless subscribers as its competitors ramped up their promotions and bundling strategies.

But the Fed cut those rates six times in a row in 2024 and 2025, driving more investors back toward dividend stocks.\nMany analysts expect Kevin Warsh, who could become the next Fed chair this May, to continue cutting rates to spur fresh lending and economic growth. If that happens, it could be smart to buy these two dividend stocks: Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) .\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire?

Continue »\nEnergy Transfer Energy Transfer, which operates over 140,000 miles of pipeline across 44 states, is one of America's top midstream companies. It charges upstream extraction companies and downstream refining companies \"tolls\" to deliver natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, and other refined products through its pipelines.\nThat business model is well-insulated from volatile commodity prices, since it merely needs those resources to keep flowing through its pipes to generate stable profits. It's also a master limited partnership ( MLP ), which blends a return of capital (which isn't taxed at the capital gains rate unless the underlying position is sold) and its own income to fund its distributions.\n\nEnergy Transfer's evergreen business model, tax-efficient structure, and exposure to soaring energy demand (partly driven by the cloud and AI markets) all make it an attractive investment. It pays a high forward yield of 7.3%, and it looks like a bargain at 12 times forward earnings.\nVerizon Verizon, which serves 146.7 million wireless customers, is one of America's top telecom companies. In recent years, it struggled to gain more wireless subscribers as its competitors ramped up their promotions and bundling strategies. Its business wireline segment also shrank as more companies pivoted toward cloud-based communications services.\nTo offset that pressure, Verizon expanded its higher-growth broadband business (including its Home Internet and FiOS fiber plans), and it recently added more than 2.2 million new fiber subscribers through its takeover of Frontier Communications.

The advanced nuclear energy company has benefited from positive news flow around nuclear investments in the United States.\nToday, the stock is trading 63% below its all-time high and could be vulnerable to further declines.

Continue »\nOklo's big deal with Meta Platforms Oklo has been making waves. The company develops advanced fission power plants called Aurora powerhouses. Its reactors can run on recycled fuel, with the Aurora powerhouse designed to operate for up to 10 years before refueling. These use metal-fueled fast reactor technology based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II. This reactor operated for 30 years at Argonne National Laboratory (now the Idaho National Laboratory) until it was shut down in 1994 when national research priorities shifted.\nNuclear energy is an appealing power source for technology companies for a few reasons. That's because it doesn't produce carbon emissions and burns more cleanly, while also providing reliable base-load power that data centers want. The problem is that it takes a long time to build a nuclear power plant. This is where Oklo's technology aims to bridge the gap by developing small, factory-built, advanced reactors designed for quick deployment and simplified on-site construction.\n\nIn January, the company came to an agreement with Meta Platforms to develop a 1.2 GW power campus. The project is planned for Ohio and supports the deployment of its Aurora powerhouses. The agreement includes Meta prepaying for power, providing Oklo with upfront capital to advance the project, with the first phase targeted for 2030 and scaling up to the full 1.2 GW capacity by 2034.\nWhat to expect from Oklo in the next few years Oklo is making moves, but investing in the stock today comes with risks. Its first commercial operating Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) isn't set to operate until late 2027 or early 2028.\nBefore that happens, it still has to obtain approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy, construct its facility, and establish a fuel supply chain. The company is making progress; late last year, it broke ground on its Aurora powerhouse at INL and is building a fuel fabrication facility on site.\n\nStory Continues\nIt'll be a few years before it's operating, and even longer before it generates a profit. The company has $1.18 billion in available cash and securities, but will likely need to raise additional capital to complete nuclear reactor deployments and expand its fuel-cycle facilities, which creates dilution risk for shareholders.\n\nOklo is a high flyer and benefits from positive news around the nuclear energy industry, but it will continue to see large price swings, especially as it establishes itself. For now, it remains a high-risk company in the nuclear industry and is best left for aggressive investors with a strong appetite for risk.\nShould you buy stock in Oklo right now?

      "Content": "What separates fast fintechs from slow banks\n\nGlobalData\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:17 AM PST 6 min read\n\nA fintech executive watches their latest customer acquisition campaign deliver thousands of signups, only for 70% to drop out before completing onboarding. A corporate client ready to move millions waits six weeks while documents shuffle between operations, compliance teams across three jurisdictions.\nThis happens daily across UK fintech. Client Lifecycle Management (CLM), encompassing onboarding, KYC, AML, and ongoing monitoring, has become a critical chokepoint in the revenue engine.\n\nIndustry data reveals the scale:\nUK banks spend £2,613 per corporate KYC review, up 19% year-on-year\nUp to 63% of customers abandon digital onboarding if it takes too long\nCorporate onboarding averages 45–90 days from application to activation\nYet reductions of up to 70% are achievable by rethinking the architecture from the ground up.\nWhy current systems create bottlenecks Most banks rely on established CLM vendors like Pega, Fenergo, KYC360, and Encompass. These platforms were designed to centralise documentation and enforce process consistency. They digitised manual workflows effectively when compliance was about record-keeping.\nToday's challenge is different. Fintechs compete on activation speed, not documentation quality. They need systems that make intelligent risk decisions in real-time, not platforms that route documents through approval queues.\nCurrent architectures create four structural bottlenecks:\n\nSequential processing across borders , even when regulatory requirements are independent\nManual validation of machine-readable data , despite the IDP being capable of instant extraction\nCompliance policies trapped in Excel files and institutional memory\nRisk discovered after sales teams have set client expectations\nLegacy platforms were built as workflow engines: route this document, collect these fields, enforce this sequence. What fintechs need are decision engines: evaluate this risk, dynamically determine requirements, activate when rules permit, and escalate only genuine ambiguity. The required transformation demands rethinking CLM from the ground up.\nFive architectural shifts that enable intelligence-led CLM Shift one: Design onboarding as revenue infrastructure Most CLM platforms measure success by audit readiness. This treats onboarding as a risk management function that happens to enable revenue, rather than a revenue function that manages risk.\nOne global bank inverted this relationship by asking: \"What's the minimum information required to activate each product safely?\" The result was layered activation:\nCore accounts opened immediately upon baseline identity and sanctions checks\nTrade finance services are activated once commercial documentation is cleared\nMulti-jurisdiction structures are processed in parallel, with each region's approval enabling incremental service access\n\nStory Continues\nClients who previously waited months could begin transacting within days. Revenue capture occurred in the first week rather than the first quarter. Regulatory risk didn't increase; it was managed more precisely.\nTechnical implementation requires:\nProgressive disclosure : Show clients only the information needed at each threshold\nContextual guidance : Explain why data is required\nSmart defaults : Pre-populate from authoritative sources\n\nWhen combined with deterministic policy execution, compliance becomes nearly invisible to users.\nShift two: Encode compliance policies as executable logic A major bank managed compliance across 50+ markets using spreadsheets. Updates are required every month. Regional teams interpreted rules differently. Audit findings multiplied.\nThe problem was that policies existed only as documentation, not as code. When rules live in PDFs, every implementation is an interpretation.\nPolicy-as-code makes compliance deterministic. Instead of \"High-risk industries require enhanced due diligence,\" the system encodes specific logic that auto-executes. This enabled a three-tier architecture:\n\n80% global core rules are deployed enterprise-wide\n15% regional configuration for jurisdiction-specific variations\n5% client-specific overrides with explicit approvals\nAll rules are exposed as APIs, enabling pre-onboarding tools to auto-generate jurisdiction-specific requirements. When new AML directives were issued, the bank deployed updated rules globally within days rather than months, ensuring identical interpretation across every jurisdiction.\nShift three: Automate document intelligence, reserve humans for judgment Traditional CLM treats document review as a human task supported by technology. Intelligence-led CLM inverts this: technology performs extraction, validation, and risk assessment; humans intervene only when genuine judgment is required.\nOne institution delivered 70% reductions in manual work through:\nIDP and data aggregators auto-populate 80% of routine information from authoritative sources\nLLMs validate extracted data against compliance requirements and auto-clear low-risk applications\nPredictive routing assigns complex cases to the right specialist immediately\nReal-time dashboards give leadership visibility into risk velocity\n\nThe key principle: machines handle pattern recognition and rule application; humans focus on ambiguous risk assessment and relationship context. The integration with Shift Two is critical, as executable policies define the rules against which AI validates documentation.\nShift four: Architect a unified intelligence layer over distributed data One bank discovered that three internal systems reported three different risk scores for the same client. In intelligence-led CLM, this is architecturally impossible.\nThe solution is an API-based data fabric treating all information as streams feeding a single analytical layer. Client data lives on a centralised platform; CLM consumes it via APIs, ensuring consistency.\nThis enables:\nReal-time data enrichment from internal and external sources\nComposite risk scoring that's continuously calculated rather than periodically updated\nParallel processing across jurisdictions\n\nOne implementation reduced corporate onboarding time by 70% while achieving zero false positives and complete audit traceability. Sequential processing adds no regulatory value when requirements are independent. Digital-native CLM should operate like modern software: distributed, parallel, coordinated through data.\nShift five: Measure business outcomes, not activity completion Traditional metrics count activity: reviews completed, documents collected, and cases pending. Intelligence-led platforms measure outcomes:\nTime to activation : How quickly clients can transact\nAudit performance : Zero high-severity findings prove speed doesn't compromise quality\nUser adoption : 90% adoption in week one signals intuitive workflows\nCustomer satisfaction : 96% satisfaction shows a better client experience\nOutcome-based measurement creates accountability for the entire system architecture. If activation is slow, the problem might be manual review, fragmented data, or inflexible policies. Workflow metrics hide these root causes. Outcome metrics expose them.\n\nThe strategic imperative Two forces make intelligence-led CLM essential:\nOpen banking adoption : UK adoption is projected to reach 60.5% by 2026, with payment volumes growing 69% year-on-year. Consented data access enables instant risk evaluation, but only if the CLM architecture can exploit it. Policy-as-code encodes logic for evaluating transaction data. Automated intelligence processes patterns at scale. Unified architecture combines open banking feeds with traditional verification.\nCollapsing customer tolerance : When 63% abandon onboarding due to excessive effort, acquisition economics break down. The gap between consumer expectations set by Amazon, Netflix, and fintech and the reality of fintech is unsustainable.\n\nThe window for differentiation Fintech competition is increasingly about infrastructure, not brand. Revolut's European growth stems from faster account activation across multiple jurisdictions than traditional banks. Stripe's dominance comes from API reliability, not cheaper fees.\nCLM is becoming the same category of infrastructure advantage. The components exist: AI for document understanding, API-based data fabrics, policy-as-code platforms. The real question is which institutions will act first.\nDay-zero activation should be the standard, not the aspiration. The transformation requires rethinking CLM from first principles: not as a workflow that routes documents, but as a decision system that evaluates risk. Not as a compliance gateway clients must pass through, but as a revenue infrastructure that enables business growth.\n\nThe institutions that make this shift will set the pace for the next decade. The question for everyone else is whether they'll follow quickly enough to survive.\nAnandhan Kannan is Lead Engineering Analyst and Regional Tech Lead (UK & Europe) at Standard Chartered Bank\n\"What separates fast fintechs from slow banks\" was originally created and published by Private Banker International , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

In intelligence-led CLM, this is architecturally impossible.\nThe solution is an API-based data fabric treating all information as streams feeding a single analytical layer. Client data lives on a centralised platform; CLM consumes it via APIs, ensuring consistency.\nThis enables:\nReal-time data enrichment from internal and external sources\nComposite risk scoring that's continuously calculated rather than periodically updated\nParallel processing across jurisdictions\n\nOne implementation reduced corporate onboarding time by 70% while achieving zero false positives and complete audit traceability. Sequential processing adds no regulatory value when requirements are independent. Digital-native CLM should operate like modern software: distributed, parallel, coordinated through data.\nShift five: Measure business outcomes, not activity completion Traditional metrics count activity: reviews completed, documents collected, and cases pending. Intelligence-led platforms measure outcomes:\nTime to activation : How quickly clients can transact\nAudit performance : Zero high-severity findings prove speed doesn't compromise quality\nUser adoption : 90% adoption in week one signals intuitive workflows\nCustomer satisfaction : 96% satisfaction shows a better client experience\nOutcome-based measurement creates accountability for the entire system architecture. If activation is slow, the problem might be manual review, fragmented data, or inflexible policies. Workflow metrics hide these root causes. Outcome metrics expose them.\n\nThe strategic imperative Two forces make intelligence-led CLM essential:\nOpen banking adoption : UK adoption is projected to reach 60.5% by 2026, with payment volumes growing 69% year-on-year. Consented data access enables instant risk evaluation, but only if the CLM architecture can exploit it. Policy-as-code encodes logic for evaluating transaction data. Automated intelligence processes patterns at scale. Unified architecture combines open banking feeds with traditional verification.\nCollapsing customer tolerance : When 63% abandon onboarding due to excessive effort, acquisition economics break down. The gap between consumer expectations set by Amazon, Netflix, and fintech and the reality of fintech is unsustainable.\n\nThe window for differentiation Fintech competition is increasingly about infrastructure, not brand. Revolut's European growth stems from faster account activation across multiple jurisdictions than traditional banks. Stripe's dominance comes from API reliability, not cheaper fees.\nCLM is becoming the same category of infrastructure advantage. The components exist: AI for document understanding, API-based data fabrics, policy-as-code platforms. The real question is which institutions will act first.\nDay-zero activation should be the standard, not the aspiration. The transformation requires rethinking CLM from first principles: not as a workflow that routes documents, but as a decision system that evaluates risk. Not as a compliance gateway clients must pass through, but as a revenue infrastructure that enables business growth.\n\nThe institutions that make this shift will set the pace for the next decade. The question for everyone else is whether they'll follow quickly enough to survive.\nAnandhan Kannan is Lead Engineering Analyst and Regional Tech Lead (UK & Europe) at Standard Chartered Bank\n\"What separates fast fintechs from slow banks\" was originally created and published by Private Banker International , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

      "Content": "How bad will SoCal storms be? Rain to ramp up Monday, but not over yet\n\nParis Barraza, USA TODAY\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:12 AM PST 3 min read\n\nA series of storm systems comes just as Valentine’s Day weekend wraps up, ushering in widespread heavy rain in Southern California on Monday, Feb. 16, as wet weather and chillier temperatures could shape much of the coming week.\nAnd if you’re headed up north, there’s no reprieve for you as the Bay Area is also expecting plentiful rain .\n\nThe wet weather follows a stretch of elevated temperatures for Southern California — several degrees higher than normally observed this time of year. For most people, the “main threat period” is Feb. 16, said David Houk, AccuWeather, senior meteorologist and western expert. Although it’s a bit farther out, some models suggest another system coming Thursday that could bring rain again, meaning Southern Californians aren’t “out of the woods yet” later next week, according to Houk.\nIs it going to rain tomorrow? Valentine’s Day forecast for LA, SoCal Good news if your Valentine’s Day plans involve the outdoors. It’s supposed to remain dry throughout Southern California on Saturday, Feb. 14, according to National Weather Service offices that serve swaths of the region.\nWhen is it supposed to rain Monday? See timing from Ventura County to San Diego County It’s the first storm system that we can expect the most widespread heavy rain, according to Houk. For those Ventura County, that rain is forecasted to begin the night of Sunday Feb. 15. The Los Angeles metro will likely see that rain come much later Sunday or first thing Monday, Feb. 16, and midday Monday farther south in San Diego, Houk said.\nIt’ll be about six to 10 hours of “pretty solid rain” and could be accompanied by some wind gusts along the coasts and in the valleys. But afterwards comes more showers at night and into the morning of Tuesday, Feb. 17.\n\nHouk doesn’t expect it’ll be something that’ll cause damaging winds or power outages. However, it’s Monday that is likely when Southern Californians will see the bulk of impacts related to the storm, such as flooding in areas prone to flooding, water build up on roadways and potential threats over in wildfire burn scars.\nExpect Tuesday and Wednesday, Feb. 18, to be chilly and damp, the AccuWeather meteorologist said.\nHow much rain are we supposed to get? LA, SoCal outlook There could be the potential for thunderstorms, particularly near the coast, on Monday, Feb. 16 through Wednesday, Feb. 18, Houk said.\nRainfall forecasts from the California Nevada River Forecast Center show Los Angeles could see two to three inches of rain by Thursday, Feb. 19. Farther north along the coast, Santa Barbara could see as much as six inches of rain by Thursday. More inland, Riverside could see two to three inches of rain as well by Thursday.\n\nStory Continues\nSnow levels to drop in San Bernardino Mountains, 5-freeway impacts Come Wednesday, Feb. 18, Southern Californians could see snow levels drop to at least 3,000 feet, and possibly lower, which could make for hazardous conditions if you’re traveling on mountain roads, including Interstate 5, the NWS Los Angeles said.\nThe NWS San Diego said snow levels could drop as low as 3,500 feet across the San Bernardino Mountains on the morning of Thursday, Feb. 19.\nParis Barraza is a reporter covering Los Angeles and Southern California for the USA TODAY Network.

It’s supposed to remain dry throughout Southern California on Saturday, Feb. 14, according to National Weather Service offices that serve swaths of the region.\nWhen is it supposed to rain Monday? See timing from Ventura County to San Diego County It’s the first storm system that we can expect the most widespread heavy rain, according to Houk. For those Ventura County, that rain is forecasted to begin the night of Sunday Feb. 15. The Los Angeles metro will likely see that rain come much later Sunday or first thing Monday, Feb. 16, and midday Monday farther south in San Diego, Houk said.\nIt’ll be about six to 10 hours of “pretty solid rain” and could be accompanied by some wind gusts along the coasts and in the valleys. But afterwards comes more showers at night and into the morning of Tuesday, Feb. 17.\n\nHouk doesn’t expect it’ll be something that’ll cause damaging winds or power outages. However, it’s Monday that is likely when Southern Californians will see the bulk of impacts related to the storm, such as flooding in areas prone to flooding, water build up on roadways and potential threats over in wildfire burn scars.\nExpect Tuesday and Wednesday, Feb. 18, to be chilly and damp, the AccuWeather meteorologist said.\nHow much rain are we supposed to get? LA, SoCal outlook There could be the potential for thunderstorms, particularly near the coast, on Monday, Feb. 16 through Wednesday, Feb. 18, Houk said.\nRainfall forecasts from the California Nevada River Forecast Center show Los Angeles could see two to three inches of rain by Thursday, Feb. 19. Farther north along the coast, Santa Barbara could see as much as six inches of rain by Thursday. More inland, Riverside could see two to three inches of rain as well by Thursday.\n\nStory Continues\nSnow levels to drop in San Bernardino Mountains, 5-freeway impacts Come Wednesday, Feb. 18, Southern Californians could see snow levels drop to at least 3,000 feet, and possibly lower, which could make for hazardous conditions if you’re traveling on mountain roads, including Interstate 5, the NWS Los Angeles said.\nThe NWS San Diego said snow levels could drop as low as 3,500 feet across the San Bernardino Mountains on the morning of Thursday, Feb. 19.\nParis Barraza is a reporter covering Los Angeles and Southern California for the USA TODAY Network.

      "Content": "Dutch Bros' Stock Opened Friday With a 17.7% Jump, Then Gave It All Back. Here's Why.\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:05 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BROS\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nDutch Bros ' (NYSE: BROS) stock made some dramatic moves on Friday morning. The drive-through coffee shop operator started the day 17.7% above Thursday's closing price, inspired by a Street-stumping earnings report. But the increase didn't last long, and investors quickly refocused on Dutch Bros' guidance targets. By 11 a.m. ET, the stock had reversed, dropping 1.8% instead.\n\nThe earnings were great, so what went wrong? Dutch Bros' fourth-quarter sales rose 29% year-over-year to $443.6 million. The analyst consensus called for $424 million. On the bottom line, unadjusted earnings soared from $0.03 to $0.17 per diluted share. Here, your average analyst would have settled for $0.09 per share.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThe company beat Wall Street's revenue target by 5% and nearly doubled the average earnings projection. With numbers like these, it's no surprise that the stock soared in Thursday's after-hours and Friday's market-open action.\nSo why did the gains fade so quickly? I see two separate issues coming together.\nManagement's revenue guidance for fiscal year 2026 was just below analyst estimates, indicating a slower full-year growth rate of roughly 22%. Amid rising ingredient prices, the pending introduction of non-drinkable food items, and greater reliance on custom build-to-suit leases, Dutch Bros also expects profit margins to shrink by 0.6 percentage points next year.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest inflation report underscored the challenge: coffee prices rose 18% year-over-year in January, validating management's warning about ingredient cost pressures.\nAll of this data was available hours before the opening bell, but the combined impact of these distinct reports wasn't immediately obvious.\nThe long-term story is still brewing Honestly, the initial price jump looked like an accurate market reaction. Even at the peak, Dutch Bros' stock only returned to prices not seen since Jan. 23, three weeks ago.\nI don't mind a longer buy-in opportunity, of course. Dutch Bros is still a tremendous growth story, targeting at least 2,029 locations by the end of 2029. That's up from 1,136 coffee shops in this report.\nA broader menu with breakfast sandwiches and pastries should also boost the business in the long run, though the rollout process will lower operating margins in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIt was fun to see the stock soar for a minute, but the real gains still lie ahead. Dutch Bros' stock is still on sale.\nShould you buy stock in Dutch Bros right now? Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dutch Bros wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

That marks a sharp change in tempo from 2025, when Nvidia advanced nearly 40% following two consecutive years of triple-digit percentage gains. Even with Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) projected to push capital expenditures beyond $600 billion in 2026, the incremental spending has not translated into renewed upside for Nvidia, as investors appear to be weighing whether AI revenue will scale in line with the capital being deployed.\n\nWarning!

JoAnne Feeney of Advisors Capital Management noted that accelerating capital expenditures could pull forward the point at which the market reaches satiation, potentially leading hyperscalers to pause and digest new compute capacity. At the same time, the cyclical character of the semiconductor industry is resurfacing in valuation discussions. Revenue is projected to grow 58% in the current calendar year and 28% in 2027, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, suggesting a deceleration from prior breakneck expansion. UBS strategists led by Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi have written that while moderating capex growth could improve perceptions of the companies doing the spending, it may prove a headwind for infrastructure providers operating in the enabling layer.\n\nValuation now frames the debate. Nvidia trades at roughly 24 times profit estimates, about in line with the Nasdaq 100 and at a slight premium to the S&P 500, yet still below its own five-year average multiple of 38 times. Despite that compression, the market does not seem to be treating the shares as discounted, which may reflect caution about how much of the AI cycle is already embedded in expectations. Estimates for 2026 revenue and earnings have barely shifted since the mega-spending plans were disclosed, as analysts appear to be waiting for greater clarity. That clarity could arrive with Nvidia's earnings report due Feb. 25 after the close, where guidance on demand and chip orders may determine whether this period of consolidation extends or sentiment begins to turn.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia Stalls as $600 Billion AI Capex Fails to Lift Shares\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 10:03 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMETA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) is sitting at the center of the AI infrastructure buildout, yet its share price has stalled even as hyperscalers continue to open the spending taps. The stock has risen less than 1% since the start of the fourth quarter and has largely moved sideways after reaching a record high in late October. That marks a sharp change in tempo from 2025, when Nvidia advanced nearly 40% following two consecutive years of triple-digit percentage gains. Even with Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) projected to push capital expenditures beyond $600 billion in 2026, the incremental spending has not translated into renewed upside for Nvidia, as investors appear to be weighing whether AI revenue will scale in line with the capital being deployed.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSome of the hesitation may come down to durability. JoAnne Feeney of Advisors Capital Management noted that accelerating capital expenditures could pull forward the point at which the market reaches satiation, potentially leading hyperscalers to pause and digest new compute capacity. At the same time, the cyclical character of the semiconductor industry is resurfacing in valuation discussions. Revenue is projected to grow 58% in the current calendar year and 28% in 2027, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, suggesting a deceleration from prior breakneck expansion. UBS strategists led by Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi have written that while moderating capex growth could improve perceptions of the companies doing the spending, it may prove a headwind for infrastructure providers operating in the enabling layer.\n\nValuation now frames the debate. Nvidia trades at roughly 24 times profit estimates, about in line with the Nasdaq 100 and at a slight premium to the S&P 500, yet still below its own five-year average multiple of 38 times. Despite that compression, the market does not seem to be treating the shares as discounted, which may reflect caution about how much of the AI cycle is already embedded in expectations. Estimates for 2026 revenue and earnings have barely shifted since the mega-spending plans were disclosed, as analysts appear to be waiting for greater clarity. That clarity could arrive with Nvidia's earnings report due Feb. 25 after the close, where guidance on demand and chip orders may determine whether this period of consolidation extends or sentiment begins to turn.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Healthcare Stock to Buy and Hold\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:50 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: HCA\n\n^GSPC\n\nLast year, HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA) , a medical facilities operator, crushed broader equities. The company faced some uncertainty heading into the new year (more on that below), but so far, it has maintained the momentum we saw in 2025. HCA Healthcare's stock is up 7% so far in 2026, which is much better than the S&P 500 's year-to-date performance.\n\nThe good news is that there might be plenty of upside left for the healthcare company. Here is why it's worth investing in HCA Healthcare and holding its shares for the long term.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nExcellent financial results HCA Healthcare owns and operates a vast number of diversified healthcare facilities, from acute care hospitals to surgery centers, across much of the U.S. and the U.K. It is one of the largest corporations in its niche in the U.S.\nThe company delivered another strong performance during the fourth quarter of 2025. Its revenue increased by a solid 6.7% to $19.5 billion on the back of healthy growth in hospital admissions, while its adjusted earnings per share jumped 28.8% to $8.01.\nHCA Healthcare's top-line guidance for its fiscal 2026 doesn't look strong at first glance. The company expects revenue of between $76.5 billion and $80 billion for the year. At the midpoint, this implies revenue growth of about 3.5% year over year, hardly eye-popping.\n\nHowever, context matters. Coming into the year, HCA Healthcare hoped that the enhanced premium tax credits, which lower the cost of medical care for some patients and increase demand, admission, and revenue for the company, would be extended. So far, they have expired. Regulatory uncertainty is a significant risk for HCA Healthcare. Amid this challenge, modest sales growth of about 3.1% isn't bad at all.\nWhy the stock is still a buy HCA Healthcare is showing that it can perform reasonably well amid regulatory challenges. The company also has important growth opportunities, including the higher demand for medical care we should observe over the next decade (and beyond) as the world's population ages. HCA Healthcare has also made a habit of growing its market share, partly by investing in initiatives that improve patient outcomes. It is currently doing so with several artificial intelligence -driven changes.\nThat's how HCA Healthcare has built strong relationships with physicians, patients, and third-party payers. The company may face some volatility this year as it continues to navigate the uncertain regulatory landscape. There's no guarantee that it will post a similar performance to last year's. However, given its position in the healthcare industry and the attractive growth opportunities it benefits from, the stock could deliver above-average returns in the long run.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in HCA Healthcare right now? Before you buy stock in HCA Healthcare, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and HCA Healthcare wasn’t one of them.

Nvidia's gained just under 2% since August, barely outpacing broader market indexes. By contrast, chipmakers TSMC and AMD are trading around 52% and 12% higher over the same period, respectively.\n\nBig Tech firms such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon are projected to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, a continuation of a multi-year surge in corporate investment in machine-learning compute and data centers, Bloomberg reported Friday.\nAnalysts say the disconnect reflects a broader recalibration among investors of how much future AI spending should be priced into equities, even for companies at the center of the boom.\n“There is perhaps growing concern that the ultimate revenue from AI will simply not keep up with the capex spend that’s been announced,” JoAnne Feeney at Advisors Capital Management told Bloomberg .\nDespite robust demand for Nvidia’s chips — and revenue projections that remain well above most rivals — valuation multiples have compressed. Nvidia now trades at roughly 24 times projected profits, roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 and only modestly above the S&P 500 — a discount by historic standards for a high-growth AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been left waiting for fresh earnings guidance to break the stalemate. Nvidia’s next quarterly report, due after the market closes Feb. 25, is widely viewed as a key catalyst that could determine whether the stock breaks out of its range or stays stuck.\nAI's reality check Market watchers point to several factors behind the stagnation.\nAfter years of accelerated capex, analysts warn that growth in technology infrastructure spending could cool, reducing the pace of orders for data-center chips.\n“Capex growth is likely to moderate from these levels, which could improve investor perceptions of those doing the spending, but is a potential negative for some companies in the enabling layer,” UBS analysts wrote in a Feb 10 note.\nBack in November, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy foreshadowed something similar, warning that persistent capex worries could weigh on Nvidia’s performance.\n\n“The concern that AI infrastructure spending growth is not sustainable is not likely to ebb,” he told Reuters.\nSome investors are also worried that the massive sums being committed to AI may deliver slower returns than expected, especially as companies build out expensive facilities and power infrastructure. Plus, chipmaking competition is heating up: Google’s TPU teams and startups developing AI processors are creating alternatives to Nvidia’s dominant GPUs, adding pressure to long-term expectations, Barron's reported Friday.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, many Wall Street strategists remain constructive on Nvidia’s position in the sector. Bullish forecasts argue that strong fundamentals — including high revenue growth and the company’s entrenched role supplying the backbone of large-scale AI systems — justify patience.\n“Given middling stock performance, supply chain signals that remain bullish, and a management team that seems frustrated with the prevailing doubts around growth and margin sustainability, the earnings set-up here seems positive — especially as we head toward GTC next month,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a Wednesday note, who recently reiterated a Buy rating and raised his price target on Nvidia.\nWith AI spending on track to remain a defining element of global technology strategy, the question for markets now is whether Nvidia’s share price will finally catch up to its narrative — or if investors are simply assigning a higher bar for proof of profitable returns.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

AGNC Investment's monthly dividend yields over 12.5%, while Ares Capital's quarterly payout yields 9.6%. Both are multiples above the S&P 500 , which yields around 1.1% these days.\nHere's a look at which of these ultra-high-yielding dividend stocks is the better option for income investors right now.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAGNC Investment: Dividend stability as long as market conditions don't deteriorate AGNC Investment is a mortgage REIT focused on investing in Agency MBS (pools of residential mortgages protected against credit risk by government agencies such as Fannie Mae ). They're low-risk fixed-income investments with relatively low returns (low-to-mid single-digit yields). The mortgage REIT boosts its returns (and risk profile) by using leverage to invest in MBS (it had a 7.2 times leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter). This investment strategy can be very lucrative.\nAs long as AGNC Investment's returns are above its cost of capital (operating costs and dividend payments), it can maintain its current dividend. The REIT has paid the same monthly dividend since 2020.\n\nThe MBS market is currently strong. That drives the REIT's view that its returns and dividends should remain in alignment. However, if market conditions deteriorate, the REIT might need to reduce its dividend. That has happened several times in the past, including in 2020. Despite those cuts, AGNC has delivered an average annualized total return of 11.8% since its 2008 IPO, driven solely by its dividend.\nAres Capital: A long history of stable and growing dividends Ares Capital is the largest BDC . It primarily makes direct loans to middle-market companies ($100 million to $1 billion in annual revenue). While these loans are riskier investments than Agency MBS, they also carry much higher interest rates (Ares' portfolio had a 9.3% weighted-average yield at the end of 2025). Further, Ares has done a masterful job underwriting loans and managing its investments over the years, as its annualized net realized loss rate is less than 0%.\nThe BDC also uses leverage to make additional debt investments. However, it has a relatively modest debt-to-equity ratio of 1.08. Ares Capital has a strong balance sheet, providing it with ample liquidity to continue expanding its portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nAres Capital's large and growing loan portfolio has supported a stable and rising dividend. The BDC has now paid a stable or growing dividend level for more than 16 consecutive years. The company generates core earnings in excess of its dividends, enabling it to build up a cushion that could cover its dividend for more than two quarters. The company's growing earnings and dividends have helped it deliver a 12% annualized total return to investors over the past 20 years.\n\nMore yield or more growth AGNC Investment and Ares Capital both pay high-yielding dividends supported by the interest income of their debt investments. AGNC's higher current yield and monthly payment schedule make it the better option for more risk-tolerant investors seeking income above all else. Meanwhile, Ares Capital offers a little more growth potential as it increases the value of its portfolio and raises its dividend, making it better for those seeking higher total returns.\nShould you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp. right now?

      "Content": "Better Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stock: AGNC Investment vs. Ares Capital\n\nMatt DiLallo, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AGNC\n\nARCC\n\n^GSPC\n\nFNMA\n\nNVDA\n\nAGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC) and Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) have gigantic dividend yields. AGNC Investment's monthly dividend yields over 12.5%, while Ares Capital's quarterly payout yields 9.6%. Both are multiples above the S&P 500 , which yields around 1.1% these days.\nHere's a look at which of these ultra-high-yielding dividend stocks is the better option for income investors right now.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAGNC Investment: Dividend stability as long as market conditions don't deteriorate AGNC Investment is a mortgage REIT focused on investing in Agency MBS (pools of residential mortgages protected against credit risk by government agencies such as Fannie Mae ). They're low-risk fixed-income investments with relatively low returns (low-to-mid single-digit yields). The mortgage REIT boosts its returns (and risk profile) by using leverage to invest in MBS (it had a 7.2 times leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter). This investment strategy can be very lucrative.\nAs long as AGNC Investment's returns are above its cost of capital (operating costs and dividend payments), it can maintain its current dividend. The REIT has paid the same monthly dividend since 2020.\n\nThe MBS market is currently strong. That drives the REIT's view that its returns and dividends should remain in alignment. However, if market conditions deteriorate, the REIT might need to reduce its dividend. That has happened several times in the past, including in 2020. Despite those cuts, AGNC has delivered an average annualized total return of 11.8% since its 2008 IPO, driven solely by its dividend.\nAres Capital: A long history of stable and growing dividends Ares Capital is the largest BDC . It primarily makes direct loans to middle-market companies ($100 million to $1 billion in annual revenue). While these loans are riskier investments than Agency MBS, they also carry much higher interest rates (Ares' portfolio had a 9.3% weighted-average yield at the end of 2025). Further, Ares has done a masterful job underwriting loans and managing its investments over the years, as its annualized net realized loss rate is less than 0%.\nThe BDC also uses leverage to make additional debt investments. However, it has a relatively modest debt-to-equity ratio of 1.08. Ares Capital has a strong balance sheet, providing it with ample liquidity to continue expanding its portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nAres Capital's large and growing loan portfolio has supported a stable and rising dividend. The BDC has now paid a stable or growing dividend level for more than 16 consecutive years. The company generates core earnings in excess of its dividends, enabling it to build up a cushion that could cover its dividend for more than two quarters. The company's growing earnings and dividends have helped it deliver a 12% annualized total return to investors over the past 20 years.\n\nMore yield or more growth AGNC Investment and Ares Capital both pay high-yielding dividends supported by the interest income of their debt investments. AGNC's higher current yield and monthly payment schedule make it the better option for more risk-tolerant investors seeking income above all else. Meanwhile, Ares Capital offers a little more growth potential as it increases the value of its portfolio and raises its dividend, making it better for those seeking higher total returns.\nShould you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp. right now?

      "Content": "UPS' plan to cut 30,000 jobs hits legal roadblock amid Amazon pivot\n\nAparajita Chatterjee\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: UPS\n\nAMZN\n\nLast month during its Q4 2025 earnings call , the delivery giant United Parcel Service ( UPS ) announced 30,000 job reductions as part of its strategy to cut Amazon volume. Now, in less than a month, UPS is facing legal escalation from one of the largest unions across the US, demanding a halt to the company’s second driver buyout plan.\n\nThis is also the second layoff for the company, which in October 2025 announced the elimination of 48,000 jobs, including roles in operations and management.\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters, also called Teamsters , which has more than 1 million active members, filed for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on February 9, in the US District Court of Massachusetts, aiming to halt UPS’ planned “Driver Choice Program,” which the union calls an illegal buyout scheme.\nIn a heated statement, Teamsters called out UPS’s callousness toward its drivers and their futures and demanded a temporary halt to this buyout.\n“For the second time in six months, UPS has proven it doesn’t care about the law, has no respect for its contract with the Teamsters, and is determined to try to screw our members out of their hard-earned money,” Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien said.\nUPS is the single largest employer in the Teamsters’ union, while competitors like Amazon still remain largely non-unionized.\nWhat is the UPS Driver Choice Program? In July 2025, UPS announced the Driver Voluntary Separation Program , its first driver buyout, offering drivers a “choice to participate in a voluntary program that supports their families and future goals.”\nMore Employment:\nApple CEO Tim Cook drops strong immigration message\nLayoffs in January reach recession-era levels\nAmazon delivers Seattle purge ahead of earnings\nAs part of the program, UPS announced a $1,800 annual service award, with a minimum payout of $10,000. At the time, Teamsters expressed its anger and highlighted UPS’s inability to fulfill the terms of a 2023 five-year contract, after which it represented over 300,000 UPS employees.\n\nThe delivery giant did not provide official numbers on how many drivers accepted the buyout last year.\nNow, news is circulating once again that UPS is offering a second buyout to its drivers as part of its decision to cut 30,000 jobs amid a strategic shift. UPS is calling it the Driver Choice Program and plans to roll it out this week.\nTeamsters and UPS legal feud With the Teamsters’ involvement in a lawsuit to delay the buyout, things can get tricky depending on the court’s decision. In a statement shared with TheStreet by a company spokesperson, UPS said that the legal proceedings will not affect its operations.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile the exact amount of the buyout is unknown, the union says it is broader in scope than the previous separation program.\nUnlike last time, which was aimed at drivers closer to retirement, this time it would be offered to all drivers at UPS, “regardless of service, and would do irreparable damage to the Teamsters and its right to representation.”\n\nAccording to the terms, UPS would pay its drivers a fixed amount in return for waiving their right to union representation and for voluntarily leaving UPS.\nTeamsters said that it has issued “more than 57 requests for information and documents” related to UPS’s revised driver buyout, but company executives ignored its requests, working in “direct violation of the UPS Teamsters agreement.”\nUPS has denied and noted this in its statement.\nTeamsters also noted six violations of its National Master Agreement by UPS in this program. These include:\nDirect dealing with workers\nElimination of union jobs, despite being contractually obligated to “establish more positions.”\nI nformation blockade and a lack of a “steward” to advise employees in a grievance\nCreating irrevocable waivers that strip drivers of future union representation.\n\nA subreddit called UPSers , with more than 148k weekly visitors, has been really abuzz, with redditors expressing mixed feelings about the program. While a few with more years under their belt are curious to take up on the offer, some are calling out the Union’s move in favor of protecting their own member count rather than for the greater good.\nMeanwhile, UPS has been largely transparent about its resizing.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated with more information on the legal proceedings and UPS’s decisions.\nRelated: 118-year-old shipping giant just delivered workers a harsh message\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 13, 2026, where it first appeared in the Employment section.

      "Content": "I Predicted That Oracle and Netflix Would Join Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Broadcom, Meta Platforms, and Tesla in the $1 Trillion Club by 2030. Here's Why That Forecast Is Being Tested in 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:31 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNFLX\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nIn August, I predicted that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) would reach at least $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030. But Netflix is down 38.6% from its 52-week high at the time of this writing, while Oracle has fallen a staggering 56.5%.\nNetflix's market cap is now just $346.9 billion as I write this, and Oracle is at $410.4 billion -- a far cry from joining Nvidia , Alphabet , Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Broadcom , Meta Platforms , Tesla , Berkshire Hathaway , and Walmart on the list of U.S. companies with at least $1 trillion in market cap.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nHere's why both growth stocks are under pressure, and if they are still buys now.\nOracle is raising capital to fund its AI spending Like many software stocks, Oracle is undergoing a steep sell-off as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts the once seemingly intractable moat of the software-as-a-service business model. But Oracle's investments are mainly centered around building out data centers for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), as well as multicloud data centers that embed its database service into third-party clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nThe market has become (rightfully) more skeptical about capital-intensive AI spending. Especially for companies like Oracle that are depending heavily on a handful of customers to fulfill order volume.\n\nOracle exited its most recent quarter with $99.98 billion in notes payable and other non-current borrowings (basically long-term debt) compared to just $19.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nOn Feb. 1, Oracle announced a plan to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds in calendar year 2026 to fund the rapid expansion of OCI and meet contractual demand from companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Meta Platforms, TikTok, and xAI. The funding will come from a mix of selling at-the-market equity, convertible preferred securities, and bonds. None of these options is good, as the interest rate won't be ideal on the bonds, and Oracle's stock price is already so beaten down.\nTaking on debt isn't the worst thing in the world if a company is generating enough cash flow to pay it off. But Oracle reported negative $13.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2026 compared to $9.5 billion in FCF in the same quarter from a year ago. Oracle has gone from being a high-margin cash cow to a capital-intensive money pit while it expands OCI. And that has investors worried that Oracle is betting too big on AI.\n\nStory Continues\nThe silver lining is that spending should decline in the coming years as Oracle's capital expenditures decrease and it starts realizing revenue from its backlog. But the company is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in AI spending.\nIf Oracle comes even remotely close to its forecast for $144 billion in fiscal 2031 (calendar year 2030) OCI revenue, the company will likely be worth far more than $1 trillion. But it could also continue underperforming the broader indexes if it doesn't get its balance sheet under control.\n\nNetflix stock is no longer priced at an ultra-premium Unlike Oracle, which has legitimate issues challenging its investment thesis, Netflix is selling off mainly for valuation concerns and mixed reactions to its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) .\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix's valuation has come down significantly since the stock peaked at a split-adjusted intraday high of $134.12 on June 30, 2025.\nTrading at just 26.3 times forward earnings, Netflix is within striking distance of the S&P 500 's forward P/E of 23.6. But Netflix is a far better company than the typical S&P 500 component.\nNetflix generates high margins and is growing at a solid rate. The company's cash flow means it can fund its content spending without relying on debt, giving it a clear runway for compounding over time.\n\nNetflix has had tons of success with both live-action and animated series and movies, from Stranger Things to its most successful film ever, KPop Demon Hunters .\nAdding Warner Bros. Discovery assets would broaden Netflix's content suite and allow it to pair HBO and HBO Max programming as a dual offering with Netflix or simply bundle it into a high-octane streaming subscription.\nWarner Bros. is a smart acquisition, but Netflix doesn't need it to succeed. Which is why the stock is still a buy even if the deal falls through.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Here's Why That Forecast Is Being Tested in 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:31 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNFLX\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nIn August, I predicted that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) would reach at least $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030. But Netflix is down 38.6% from its 52-week high at the time of this writing, while Oracle has fallen a staggering 56.5%.\nNetflix's market cap is now just $346.9 billion as I write this, and Oracle is at $410.4 billion -- a far cry from joining Nvidia , Alphabet , Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Broadcom , Meta Platforms , Tesla , Berkshire Hathaway , and Walmart on the list of U.S. companies with at least $1 trillion in market cap.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nHere's why both growth stocks are under pressure, and if they are still buys now.\nOracle is raising capital to fund its AI spending Like many software stocks, Oracle is undergoing a steep sell-off as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts the once seemingly intractable moat of the software-as-a-service business model. But Oracle's investments are mainly centered around building out data centers for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), as well as multicloud data centers that embed its database service into third-party clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nThe market has become (rightfully) more skeptical about capital-intensive AI spending. Especially for companies like Oracle that are depending heavily on a handful of customers to fulfill order volume.\n\nOracle exited its most recent quarter with $99.98 billion in notes payable and other non-current borrowings (basically long-term debt) compared to just $19.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nOn Feb. 1, Oracle announced a plan to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds in calendar year 2026 to fund the rapid expansion of OCI and meet contractual demand from companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Meta Platforms, TikTok, and xAI. The funding will come from a mix of selling at-the-market equity, convertible preferred securities, and bonds. None of these options is good, as the interest rate won't be ideal on the bonds, and Oracle's stock price is already so beaten down.\nTaking on debt isn't the worst thing in the world if a company is generating enough cash flow to pay it off. But Oracle reported negative $13.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2026 compared to $9.5 billion in FCF in the same quarter from a year ago. Oracle has gone from being a high-margin cash cow to a capital-intensive money pit while it expands OCI. And that has investors worried that Oracle is betting too big on AI.\n\nStory Continues\nThe silver lining is that spending should decline in the coming years as Oracle's capital expenditures decrease and it starts realizing revenue from its backlog. But the company is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in AI spending.\nIf Oracle comes even remotely close to its forecast for $144 billion in fiscal 2031 (calendar year 2030) OCI revenue, the company will likely be worth far more than $1 trillion. But it could also continue underperforming the broader indexes if it doesn't get its balance sheet under control.\n\nNetflix stock is no longer priced at an ultra-premium Unlike Oracle, which has legitimate issues challenging its investment thesis, Netflix is selling off mainly for valuation concerns and mixed reactions to its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) .\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix's valuation has come down significantly since the stock peaked at a split-adjusted intraday high of $134.12 on June 30, 2025.\nTrading at just 26.3 times forward earnings, Netflix is within striking distance of the S&P 500 's forward P/E of 23.6. But Netflix is a far better company than the typical S&P 500 component.\nNetflix generates high margins and is growing at a solid rate. The company's cash flow means it can fund its content spending without relying on debt, giving it a clear runway for compounding over time.\n\nNetflix has had tons of success with both live-action and animated series and movies, from Stranger Things to its most successful film ever, KPop Demon Hunters .\nAdding Warner Bros. Discovery assets would broaden Netflix's content suite and allow it to pair HBO and HBO Max programming as a dual offering with Netflix or simply bundle it into a high-octane streaming subscription.\nWarner Bros. is a smart acquisition, but Netflix doesn't need it to succeed. Which is why the stock is still a buy even if the deal falls through.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nHere's why both growth stocks are under pressure, and if they are still buys now.\nOracle is raising capital to fund its AI spending Like many software stocks, Oracle is undergoing a steep sell-off as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts the once seemingly intractable moat of the software-as-a-service business model. But Oracle's investments are mainly centered around building out data centers for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), as well as multicloud data centers that embed its database service into third-party clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nThe market has become (rightfully) more skeptical about capital-intensive AI spending. Especially for companies like Oracle that are depending heavily on a handful of customers to fulfill order volume.\n\nOracle exited its most recent quarter with $99.98 billion in notes payable and other non-current borrowings (basically long-term debt) compared to just $19.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nOn Feb. 1, Oracle announced a plan to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in gross cash proceeds in calendar year 2026 to fund the rapid expansion of OCI and meet contractual demand from companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Meta Platforms, TikTok, and xAI. The funding will come from a mix of selling at-the-market equity, convertible preferred securities, and bonds. None of these options is good, as the interest rate won't be ideal on the bonds, and Oracle's stock price is already so beaten down.\nTaking on debt isn't the worst thing in the world if a company is generating enough cash flow to pay it off. But Oracle reported negative $13.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2026 compared to $9.5 billion in FCF in the same quarter from a year ago. Oracle has gone from being a high-margin cash cow to a capital-intensive money pit while it expands OCI. And that has investors worried that Oracle is betting too big on AI.\n\nStory Continues\nThe silver lining is that spending should decline in the coming years as Oracle's capital expenditures decrease and it starts realizing revenue from its backlog. But the company is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in AI spending.\nIf Oracle comes even remotely close to its forecast for $144 billion in fiscal 2031 (calendar year 2030) OCI revenue, the company will likely be worth far more than $1 trillion. But it could also continue underperforming the broader indexes if it doesn't get its balance sheet under control.\n\nNetflix stock is no longer priced at an ultra-premium Unlike Oracle, which has legitimate issues challenging its investment thesis, Netflix is selling off mainly for valuation concerns and mixed reactions to its planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) .\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix's valuation has come down significantly since the stock peaked at a split-adjusted intraday high of $134.12 on June 30, 2025.\nTrading at just 26.3 times forward earnings, Netflix is within striking distance of the S&P 500 's forward P/E of 23.6. But Netflix is a far better company than the typical S&P 500 component.\nNetflix generates high margins and is growing at a solid rate. The company's cash flow means it can fund its content spending without relying on debt, giving it a clear runway for compounding over time.\n\nNetflix has had tons of success with both live-action and animated series and movies, from Stranger Things to its most successful film ever, KPop Demon Hunters .\nAdding Warner Bros. Discovery assets would broaden Netflix's content suite and allow it to pair HBO and HBO Max programming as a dual offering with Netflix or simply bundle it into a high-octane streaming subscription.\nWarner Bros. is a smart acquisition, but Netflix doesn't need it to succeed. Which is why the stock is still a buy even if the deal falls through.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now?

      "Content": "European VC firms band together to tackle continent’s lacklustre capital\n\nRobert Barrie\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:17 AM PST 3 min read\n\nEuropean venture capital (VC) firms have joined forces to establish the European Life Sciences Coalition (ELSC), the latest move by the continent’s life sciences industry to tackle a slump in its financial attractiveness.\nLife sciences VC titans Sofinnova Partners and Novo Holdings are among the nine founding members of the group, which has been created in association with Invest Europe, a trade association representing VC, private equity, and infrastructure sectors.\n\nThose within the ELSC framework collectively manage more than €24bn ($28.6bn) in life sciences-specific assets and have invested in or helped found over 1,400 life sciences and biotech companies. The aim of the coalition is to strengthen Europe’s life sciences and biotechnology VC ecosystem by mobilising greater levels of private and public investment across the sector.\nNaveed Siddiqi, senior partner of Venture Investments at Novo Holdings, said: “To succeed and scale, life sciences companies need access to substantial capital and policy frameworks that recognise the realities of developing complex, science-based businesses. Equally important, the sector requires access to experience, long-term engagement, and a deep understanding of how these businesses are built and financed over time.”\n\nThe ELSC’s creation comes amid a difficult financing scene for life sciences and biotech companies in Europe. Despite overall biotech venture funding increasing in the second half of 2025 , European biotechs are struggling to capture the same capital as those in US and China. European life sciences VC funds currently account for just 7% of the global market, compared with 63% in the US and 14% in China, according to the ELSC. As per a recent report from BioIndustry Association (BIA), equity financing and VC in the UK dropped by 49% and 13%, respectively, in 2025 compared to 2024.\nA clear reflection of Europe’s unattractiveness for budding companies is that all but one of 67 EU biotechs that went public over the past six years have listed on stock exchanges outside the continent.\n\n“The coalition is not calling for handouts, but for a fundamental shift in how European capital is deployed,” the ELSC said in a statement.\nThe life science industry is a key cog in Europe’s economic output. For example, pharma exports reached €313.4bn in 2024 – the US being the primary destination of products. Faced with a difficult outlook for the next wave of companies, the European Commission (EC) has proposed the Biotech Act, a framework intended to make Europe a more competitive area for biotechs to work and invest in, as well as accelerating lab-to-market times. EuropaBio, the European bioindustry association, welcomed the proposal , but added that a bold approach to investment is still needed.\n\nStory Continues\nArmed with influential VC firms, the ELSC could facilitate that next step. The members stated they can bring “practical, market-driven perspectives to policy discussions on capital allocation, company formation, and scale-up dynamics”.\n\"European VC firms band together to tackle continent’s lacklustre capital\" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

      "Content": "Copper miner Codelco sacks executives after El Teniente audit\n\nBy Fabian Cambero\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:15 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: HG=F\n\nBy Fabian Cambero\nSANTIAGO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Chilean state copper miner Codelco on Friday removed three senior executives linked to its El Teniente division, the site of a ‌deadly collapse last year, after an internal audit found inconsistencies tied to a prior ‌accident in the same mine.\nCodelco said that an internal audit stemming from the July accident at El Teniente uncovered \"serious breaches ​of duty\" by executives after a rock explosion within the mine in 2023, including in the company's reports to mining regulator Sernageomin.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow will the deadly collapse affect El Teniente's future production?\n\nWhat governance changes is Codelco implementing after the audit findings?\n\nWhat were the serious breaches of duty found at El Teniente?\n\nWhy did Codelco remove three senior executives from El Teniente?\n\nCodelco's Chief Operations Officer Mauricio Barraza, who oversaw all of Codelco's mine divisions, as well as El Teniente head Claudio Sougarret and El Teniente projects manager Rodrigo Andrades will ‌be replaced immediately, Codelco said.\nBarraza ⁠had previously served as mine head. Sougarret was brought on to lead the mine in August, following the accident. He had previously been operations manager ⁠there.\nThe removal of some of Codelco's top operational leaders underscores the complexity of the technical challenges dating back years at El Teniente, the world's largest underground copper mine.\nBarraza will be replaced by Lindor Quiroga and ​Sougarret ​will be replaced by Gustavo Reyes. Claudio Canut will ​also take over as interim head ‌of the Andina division, Codelco said.\n\n\"RADICAL\" REORGANIZATION\nCodelco's board said in a separate statement on Friday that it had also identified weaknesses in governance at El Teniente and throughout the firm more broadly.\nThe board approved a \"radical\" reorganization of operations at El Teniente, with senior executives more involved in the mine's day-to-day affairs.\nUnalterable digital signatures will be implemented on technical reports, the board said. It did ‌not say whether the former executives had altered signatures.\nCodelco ​added that it would hand over information to Chile's public ​prosecutor's office while opening further internal ​audits.\nDIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD\nThe collapse last year occurred in an expansion project at the ‌flagship mine that was meant to boost ​output at a time ​when the company is struggling to lift production.\nOn Tuesday Sougarret told Reuters that output at the mine, once Codelco's most productive, would be depressed for the next five years, ​a longer estimate than the miner's ‌previous estimate of three years.\nHe said that production would likely hover around 301,000 metric ​tons of copper per year during that period.\n(Reporting by Fabian Cambero; Writing by ​Kylie Madry; Editing by Cassandra Garrison, Kirsten Donovan)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Oxbridge Re CEO Jay Madhu says reinsurance could move onchain soon\n\nAnand Sinha\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OXBR\n\nAs more corners of traditional finance experiment with tokenization, the reinsurance market may not be far behind.\nOxbridge Re Holdings (NASDAQ: OXBR) founder, chairman and CEO Jay Madhu said the majority of reinsurance business moving onchain is closer than many might expect.\n“It’s not very far,” Madhu said in a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable host Jackson Hinkle .\nRelated: What is tokenization? Explained\nTokenization could ease capital constraints Madhu argues that access to capital is the central force shaping reinsurance pricing, and, therefore, the cost of home insurance for everyday consumers.\n“Constraint to capital is what drives prices,” he said, pointing to Florida as a prime example. Insurers in the state currently pay about 45 cents on the dollar for reinsurance coverage, a cost that ultimately flows through to homeowners in the form of higher premiums.\nIf access to reinsurance capital were broadened through tokenization , Madhu believes pricing could fall.\nTwo things will happen, he said. The investors who are investing in reinsurance will make a good return, and the general public will also benefit, he added.\nBy opening the asset class to a global pool of investors, Madhu contends that blockchain rails could “even the playing field,” reducing friction and expanding participation beyond traditional institutional players.\n\nStill, he emphasized that compliance and transparency remain non-negotiable.\n“AML and KYC are paramount,” he said.\nPopular on TheStreet Roundtable: Another crypto company halts withdrawals as markets slide\nGold, silver, S&P 500, crypto crash again amid extreme fear\nCathie Wood just made her biggest stock purchase of 2026\nOpening reinsurance to retail users Oxbridge Re is already putting the concept into practice through its tokenized offerings.\nThe company has launched its latest reinsurance season contracts via a Web3 real-world asset subsidiary called AssurancePlus, allowing investors to participate directly in excess-of-loss reinsurance. The reinsurance season runs from June 1 through May 31 of the following year, and capital is currently being raised for the next cycle.\nInvestors who complete AML and KYC verification can purchase one of two security tokens tied to reinsurance performance, Madhu said.\nOne token targets a 20% annualized return, while another offering targets 42%. The higher-yielding token carries more risk but has historically delivered outsized returns, Madhu added.\n\nStory Continues\nLast year’s 42% target token paid out 49%, he said, while this year’s 42% target is expected to come in “a little bit north of 42%.” The 20% token, issued for the first time last year, is expected to return roughly 25%, he added.\nAssurance 3.0 on Solana The next iteration, dubbed “Assurance 3.0,\" will see Oxbridge Re issue its security tokens on Solana (SOL), Madhu saod.\nThe firm is working with AlphaLedger and is already a partner with Securitize, positioning the offering within established digital securities infrastructure, he added.\nFor Madhu, the combination of blockchain efficiency, regulatory compliance and global investor access could fundamentally reshape how reinsurance capital is sourced.\nRelated: What are tokenized stocks?

It's one of Walmart's bestsellers, and with good reason.\nThe Veanerwood Farmhouse Shoe Cabinet is on sale for only $95, which is 47% off the regular price of $180. There may never be a better opportunity to get a shoe cabinet of this high quality at such a low price.\n\nVeanerwood Farmhouse Shoe Cabinet, $95 (was $180) at Walmart Why do shoppers love it? The cabinet has all the hallmarks of a utilitarian piece that also punches far above its weight class in terms of looks. The country farmhouse aesthetic is everywhere these days, so why shouldn't it be in your home? The cabinet does a great job of hiding two large shoe cubbies behind two cross-hatched woodgrain front panels. Each shoe cubby has a large ergonomic handle at the top for opening and closing. The panels have two separate rows for shoes, which means that each cubby can fit up to eight pairs of shoes in total.\n\nAbove the top shoe cubby is another open shelf where you can store books, knicknacks, or other ephemera that aids in disguising the cabinet as a standard sideboard. There's also a top shelf above that for overflow items as well. The entire cabinet is made from engineered wood that's designed to mimic weathered wood. It has a rustic feel that belies the manufactured nature of each individual piece.\nThe cabinet has overall dimensions of 31.5 inches long by 9.37 inches wide by 44.65 inches high. The narrow footprint of the piece makes it a perfect choice for placing just inside the front door as an entryway piece. It's available in two different size configurations and eight color variants. There's surely an option for just about anyone, though some variations have already sold out.\n\nRelated: Walmart's bestselling comfy sofa is on sale for $250\nDetails to know Dimensions: 31.5 inches long by 9.37 inches wide by 44.65 inches high.\nMaterials: Wood-grain engineered wood.\nShoe capacity: 16 pairs.\nWalmart customers were very satisfied with this piece.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nIn HelloNation, Bathroom Remodeling Expert Riccardo Mastrosimone of Webster, NY, Shares Functional Bathroom Design Ideas\n\nPR Newswire\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:14 AM PST 4 min read\n\nWEBSTER, N.Y. , Feb. 13, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- What makes a bathroom truly functional as well as beautiful? According to a HelloNation article , the best bathroom design ideas combine comfort, efficiency, and durability to create spaces that work for every member of the household. Riccardo Mastrosimone of Arrow Kitchens & Bath in Webster, New York, explains how a well-planned bathroom remodel can blend thoughtful features and smart materials for a functional bathroom that lasts.\n\nThe article begins by emphasizing that a functional bathroom is one that adapts to your daily routine. Whether multiple people share the space in the morning or one person uses it as a place to unwind at night, design decisions should focus on practicality and flow. For example, a double vanity is one of the most effective ways to reduce congestion during busy hours. It provides two sinks, more countertop area, and added storage to make daily use easier and more efficient. For smaller bathrooms, a single vanity with built-in drawers or shelving can achieve similar results without crowding the room.\nLayout is another key consideration. The article notes that maintaining at least 21 inches of clearance in front of major fixtures helps improve comfort and accessibility. This spacing ensures that doors open easily and that users can move freely throughout the room. Thoughtful planning during a bathroom remodel allows the space to feel open and balanced, improving both function and aesthetics.\n\nAmong today's most practical bathroom design ideas, the walk-in shower continues to stand out. A walk-in shower provides easy entry, requires less space than a traditional tub, and offers a sleek, modern look. For long-term convenience, homeowners can add built-in benches, recessed shelves, or frameless glass doors. These design details make the bathroom appear larger while keeping the space safe and clutter-free.\nMaterial selection plays a crucial role in maintaining a clean, efficient, and long-lasting environment. Bathrooms face constant humidity, so nonporous surfaces are essential. Quartz countertops and solid-surface materials are highly recommended for vanities and shower walls because they resist stains, mold, and moisture. These materials are also easy to clean and maintain, helping homeowners avoid time-consuming upkeep. Incorporating durable, moisture-resistant materials into a bathroom remodel ensures lasting performance and a polished finish.\n\nStorage is another cornerstone of a functional bathroom. The HelloNation article explains that clutter-free design improves both appearance and usability. Closed drawers and cabinets help protect toiletries from moisture, while floating vanities create visual openness and make floors easier to clean. Recessed niches and medicine cabinets keep everyday essentials organized without taking up counter space. With the right storage strategy, even compact bathrooms can feel spacious and efficient.\n\nStory Continues\nLighting also has a major impact on how a bathroom feels and functions. Proper illumination makes grooming tasks easier and adds a sense of warmth to the space. Mastrosimone recommends layered lighting, combining ambient, task, and accent sources. For instance, sconces mounted at eye level on either side of a mirror reduce shadows, while ceiling fixtures and recessed lights provide even overall brightness. Adding a dimmer switch gives users control over light levels, allowing them to adjust the atmosphere from bright morning energy to calm evening relaxation.\n\nGood ventilation is another vital part of any bathroom design. Without it, humidity can damage walls, paint, and cabinetry while encouraging mold growth. A high-quality exhaust fan, positioned near the shower or tub, helps regulate moisture and maintain air quality. The article points out that proper ventilation is one of the simplest and most effective ways to extend the life of your bathroom while keeping it healthy and comfortable.\nFlooring also contributes to both safety and comfort. Porcelain tile is often the best choice for a bathroom remodel because it is durable, water-resistant, and available in numerous colors and patterns. Textured finishes can help prevent slipping, while radiant heat installed beneath the tile adds comfort in colder months. Coordinating floor and wall tones helps create a cohesive, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nFinally, planning for the future is a hallmark of smart bathroom design ideas. Features like wider doorways, lever-style faucets, and zero-threshold walk-in showers allow the bathroom to accommodate changes over time, such as aging in place or family growth. Universal design principles make a bathroom not only functional but adaptable to a variety of needs.\nAs Mastrosimone concludes, the most successful bathroom remodels combine practical design, durable materials, and thoughtful layouts. Incorporating double vanities, quartz countertops, solid-surface materials, and proper ventilation creates a bathroom that looks beautiful and performs flawlessly for years. A functional bathroom goes beyond appearance—it enhances daily life, supports comfort, and adds value to the home.\n\nThe article, Bathroom Design Ideas for Better Functionality , features insights from Riccardo Mastrosimone, Bathroom Remodeling Expert of Webster, NY, in HelloNation.\nAbout HelloNation\nHelloNation is a premier media platform that connects readers with trusted professionals and businesses across various industries.

According to a HelloNation article , the best bathroom design ideas combine comfort, efficiency, and durability to create spaces that work for every member of the household. Riccardo Mastrosimone of Arrow Kitchens & Bath in Webster, New York, explains how a well-planned bathroom remodel can blend thoughtful features and smart materials for a functional bathroom that lasts.\n\nThe article begins by emphasizing that a functional bathroom is one that adapts to your daily routine. Whether multiple people share the space in the morning or one person uses it as a place to unwind at night, design decisions should focus on practicality and flow. For example, a double vanity is one of the most effective ways to reduce congestion during busy hours. It provides two sinks, more countertop area, and added storage to make daily use easier and more efficient. For smaller bathrooms, a single vanity with built-in drawers or shelving can achieve similar results without crowding the room.\nLayout is another key consideration. The article notes that maintaining at least 21 inches of clearance in front of major fixtures helps improve comfort and accessibility. This spacing ensures that doors open easily and that users can move freely throughout the room. Thoughtful planning during a bathroom remodel allows the space to feel open and balanced, improving both function and aesthetics.\n\nAmong today's most practical bathroom design ideas, the walk-in shower continues to stand out. A walk-in shower provides easy entry, requires less space than a traditional tub, and offers a sleek, modern look. For long-term convenience, homeowners can add built-in benches, recessed shelves, or frameless glass doors. These design details make the bathroom appear larger while keeping the space safe and clutter-free.\nMaterial selection plays a crucial role in maintaining a clean, efficient, and long-lasting environment. Bathrooms face constant humidity, so nonporous surfaces are essential. Quartz countertops and solid-surface materials are highly recommended for vanities and shower walls because they resist stains, mold, and moisture. These materials are also easy to clean and maintain, helping homeowners avoid time-consuming upkeep. Incorporating durable, moisture-resistant materials into a bathroom remodel ensures lasting performance and a polished finish.\n\nStorage is another cornerstone of a functional bathroom. The HelloNation article explains that clutter-free design improves both appearance and usability. Closed drawers and cabinets help protect toiletries from moisture, while floating vanities create visual openness and make floors easier to clean. Recessed niches and medicine cabinets keep everyday essentials organized without taking up counter space. With the right storage strategy, even compact bathrooms can feel spacious and efficient.\n\nStory Continues\nLighting also has a major impact on how a bathroom feels and functions. Proper illumination makes grooming tasks easier and adds a sense of warmth to the space. Mastrosimone recommends layered lighting, combining ambient, task, and accent sources. For instance, sconces mounted at eye level on either side of a mirror reduce shadows, while ceiling fixtures and recessed lights provide even overall brightness. Adding a dimmer switch gives users control over light levels, allowing them to adjust the atmosphere from bright morning energy to calm evening relaxation.\n\nGood ventilation is another vital part of any bathroom design. Without it, humidity can damage walls, paint, and cabinetry while encouraging mold growth. A high-quality exhaust fan, positioned near the shower or tub, helps regulate moisture and maintain air quality. The article points out that proper ventilation is one of the simplest and most effective ways to extend the life of your bathroom while keeping it healthy and comfortable.\nFlooring also contributes to both safety and comfort. Porcelain tile is often the best choice for a bathroom remodel because it is durable, water-resistant, and available in numerous colors and patterns. Textured finishes can help prevent slipping, while radiant heat installed beneath the tile adds comfort in colder months. Coordinating floor and wall tones helps create a cohesive, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nFinally, planning for the future is a hallmark of smart bathroom design ideas. Features like wider doorways, lever-style faucets, and zero-threshold walk-in showers allow the bathroom to accommodate changes over time, such as aging in place or family growth. Universal design principles make a bathroom not only functional but adaptable to a variety of needs.\nAs Mastrosimone concludes, the most successful bathroom remodels combine practical design, durable materials, and thoughtful layouts. Incorporating double vanities, quartz countertops, solid-surface materials, and proper ventilation creates a bathroom that looks beautiful and performs flawlessly for years. A functional bathroom goes beyond appearance—it enhances daily life, supports comfort, and adds value to the home.\n\nThe article, Bathroom Design Ideas for Better Functionality , features insights from Riccardo Mastrosimone, Bathroom Remodeling Expert of Webster, NY, in HelloNation.\nAbout HelloNation\nHelloNation is a premier media platform that connects readers with trusted professionals and businesses across various industries.

With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to CEO, Hessam Nadji.\n\nStory Continues\nThank you, Jacques. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year end 2025 earnings call. I am pleased to report MMI's continued recovery from one of the most complex and prolonged market disruptions on record with 2025 revenue growth of 8.5% and adjusted EBITDA improving to $25,000,000 compared to $9,000,000 in 2024. The fourth quarter particularly showed the strength of our resolve and execution as we set out to beat the exceptional 2024 fourth quarter which had been propelled by a significant drop in interest rates. Despite entering 2025 without the benefit of lower interest rates, I am proud to report that we beat the tough comp by 2% on the top line and significantly improved profitability.\n\nWe drove these results through elevated client outreach, tapping our extended lender network, and taking advantage of key market improvements despite the absence of lower interest rates. A larger than expected resurrection and closing of deals that had been delayed or canceled early in the quarter and a lift in urgency among our private clients deciding to take advantage of bonus depreciation by year end were key factors in the late stage rally. Although the bonus depreciation provision of the new tax law does not phase out, its advantage became a stronger motivating factor in getting deals closed in the final period of the year.\nI am also pleased to report that 2025 marked the strongest growth in our salesforce in seven years with nearly 100 net additions of brokerage and financing professionals. Various initiatives to combat the unusual pandemic and post-pandemic forces that had elevated our new agent dropout rate culminated in this critical return to growth. The additions include a steady cadre of experienced individuals and teams that continue to choose MMI as the ideal platform for taking their career to the next level. We are very encouraged by last year's hiring results and a strong candidate pipeline going into 2026. Throughout 2025, we maintained our market leadership position by transaction count, completing nearly 9,000 transactions totaling over $50,000,000,000 in volume.\n\nThis translates to more than 35 transactions per business day, reinforcing a consistent expansion of client relationships and enabling our team to move capital across markets and property types. Looking back, three key factors impacted our performance in 2025, all of which also bode well for the outlook in 2026. First, capital markets and investor sentiment improved particularly in the second half of the year after recovering from the initial shock of Liberation Day. Despite a cautious Federal Reserve that lowered rates at a much slower pace than anticipated, lender spreads compressed by 75 to 100 basis points and loan-to-value ratios expanded.\nMany lenders have repaired balance sheets, restructured, and/or resolved a large portion of maturities, and have more capacity as transaction volume has picked up. Second, momentum in our private client and middle market segments picked up last year, as prices finally began to adjust and regional banks and credit unions became more active. MMI's $1 to $20,000,000 transaction count and revenue each grew 12% as we started to reestablish our traditional advantage in these segments. This part of the market not only comprises the vast majority of commercial property stock and transactions, but it is also poised for more activity as a narrowing bid-ask spread releases pent-up supply from sellers who previously were hanging on to assets.\n\nThird, our financing business continues a strong trajectory with revenue up 23% in 2025, after growing 26% in 2024. This solid pace is the result of our expanded cadre of experienced financing professionals and the team's ability to access over 420 separate lenders last year. Our team of nearly 100 finance professionals is interconnected through our proprietary technology which is integrated with our expansive lender relationships. This tech-enabled combination secures the most optimal financing options available in the marketplace. MMCC and IPA Capital Markets closed over 1,600 transactions for a volume of nearly $12,000,000,000 which includes a $2,300,000,000 portion placed with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, primarily through our strategic alliance with M&T Bank.\n\nAgency financing has been one of the fastest growing segments of our business thanks to the talent acquisition and rapidly growing collaboration we have managed to pull off between our finance professionals and our sales teams. The only segment that was off last year was our larger transactions valued at $20,000,000 or more which declined by 13%. This is primarily driven by a tough comparison to 2024 when our institutional segment led the recovery with a 28% revenue increase including an 88% surge in 2024. Institutional apartment sales, which showed strength in 2024, eased as the acute flight to safety limited the buyer pool for lower tier assets and secondary markets.\nWhile our IPA division is well positioned to continue expanding in the institutional arena, some volatility is to be expected as a number of metros grapple with oversupply. The ripple effect of high vacancies, particularly for multifamily in these metros, is leading to a rise in underperforming assets that are not yet priced to clear the market. In summary, we are pleased with the significant improvement in the company's key metrics; however, we are laser focused on driving further momentum in the pace of recovery and capturing the substantial growth runway ahead of us.\n\nWe enter 2026 with greater clarity on the path to achieving this thanks to a largely recalibrated marketplace and our unwavering conviction in our client value proposition. Building on that strengthening position, we remain disciplined in our approach to strategic investments while maintaining prudent cost controls. The investments we have made over the past several years in talent retention and acquisition, technology, infrastructure, and branding are beginning to show leverage as the revenue tide turns. As I have mentioned on previous calls, the expensing of capital investments has been an outsized drag on earnings since the start of the market disruption in 2023, given the hampered revenue production of the past few years.\nAs market conditions and broker productivity improve, so will the production level of the talent pools we have retained and added to over the past several years. As a critical part of our technology strategy to leverage AI and drive efficiency, the company's centralized back office and marketing center called Brokerage Transaction Services, or BTS, is intensifying its reliance on third-party services at a lower cost while we also begin to leverage various AI applications to our benefit. These efforts are concentrated in financial analysis, document generation, underwriting, and lead scoring. All of these efforts are showing promising results but need significant advancement in the AI capacity and the use of historical data mining for accuracy and scalability.\n\nHessam Nadji: We expect and fully embrace the opportunity that AI has opened for massive efficiency in virtually all aspects of property analysis, underwriting, client targeting, and outreach. An era of higher throughput at a much lower cost is emerging, and our goal is to lead this tremendous productivity gain over time. However, we do not expect AI to disintermediate the function of a value-added broker given the expertise, building-by-building nuances, and buyer-seller relationships that ultimately drive the commercial real estate industry. In our view, the broker of the future will be armed with an array of additional analytics, with more efficiency in a way that will help clients create value.\nAt the same time, value-added offerings such as our auction services and loan sales division continue to gain traction, generating direct incremental revenue and increasing sales and financing opportunities through collaboration with our sales force. Looking ahead, we enter 2026 with greater optimism driven by several positive market fundamentals. Interest rates, while still elevated, have stabilized, which provides a more predictable valuation benchmark. Simply stated, values have to adjust to the new normal in the cost of debt, and they are doing so. The price corrections over the past three years combined with a major pullback in new construction are creating compelling investment opportunities, especially on a replacement cost basis.\n\nCap rates are up 85 to 110 basis points on average since 2022, and prices are down roughly 20% on average. This, combined with lower all-in interest rates driven largely by lower lender spreads, should further bolster investor demand and capital flows in 2026. Despite expectations of a more accommodative Federal Reserve, inflation pressures and trade-related variables would likely limit the Fed's ability to significantly lower rates. While the labor market is slowing faster than expected, the incoming Fed chair will most likely face the same obstacles to lowering rates. Nevertheless, we expect last year's transaction market improvements to continue as time narrows the bid-ask spread and facilitates the sale of many delayed trades.\n2026 is a milestone year for all of us at MMI as we celebrate the company's 55-year anniversary. Many aspects of the company's culture that retain and attract the best of the best in brokerage, financing, management, and support functions find their cornerstones in the company's founding principles that still drive us today. These include bringing efficiency and value, liquidity, and certainty to an otherwise fragmented market, measuring our success by our clients' results, and creating long-term and rewarding careers for all team members at Marcus & Millichap, Inc. As we mark this important milestone, all eyes are on the future and our quest to lead in an ever-changing industry.\n\nOur multi-pronged growth strategy includes expanding our leadership in the private client market, further penetrating the institutional segment through IPA, and accelerating the scaling of our financing, auction, loan sales, and client advisory services. Given our disciplined approach to acquisitions, recent attempts to acquire additional financing boutiques, appraisal and valuation firms, and complementary adjunct businesses such as investment management and cost segregation have not yet come to fruition. However, they will in time as the company is committed to providing an array of additional services that align with our dominance in investment brokerage and finance. Our ultimate goal is to enhance our offerings to a client base we have come to know extremely well throughout the years.\n\nPowering this vision is MMI's stellar balance sheet with nearly $400,000,000 in cash, reinforcing our ample purchasing power for strategic acquisitions, which we continue to pursue. Most recently, we have engaged in multiple large-scale explorations that would enable us to expand our financing business more rapidly. We are proud to have balanced strong liquidity and purchasing power with a consistent return of capital to shareholders, with $47,000,000 provided in dividends and share repurchases executed in 2025. As we look to the future, we are excited about a new real estate cycle and the vast opportunities ahead for expanding our market presence and revenue diversification to enhance long-term value. I will now turn the call over to Steven F.\n\nDeGennaro for more details on our results. Steve?\nSteven F. DeGennaro: Thank you, Hessam. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $244,000,000, an increase of 2% compared to $240,000,000 for the same period in the prior year. As Hessam mentioned, year-over-year comparisons in Q4 are against an exceptionally strong fourth quarter last year. For the full year, total revenue was $755,000,000, up 8.5% compared to $696,000,000 last year. Breaking down revenue by segment, real estate brokerage commissions for the fourth quarter were $205,000,000, moderately exceeding last year's tough comp and accounting for 84% of quarterly revenue. We completed 1,902 brokerage transactions with a total volume of $11,800,000,000 for the quarter.\nWhile transaction dollar volume was lower by 4%, transaction deal count was up by more than 9% over last year, and the average commission rate was 1.7%. The relative increase in private client transactions contributed to a 7% decrease in the average fee per transaction given the higher mix of smaller deals. For the full year 2025, revenue from real estate brokerage commissions was $633,000,000 compared to $590,000,000 last year, an increase of 7%. We completed a total of 6,038 brokerage transactions, up 11%, with total volume of $35,000,000,000, up 3.5% compared to prior year. For the year, average transaction size was $5,800,000 compared to $6,200,000 in the prior year, reflecting the pickup in private client activity.\n\nWithin brokerage for the quarter, our core private client business accounted for 65% of brokerage revenue, or $133,000,000, up from 59% and $120,000,000 in the same period last year. Private client transactions grew 13% in volume and 10% in transaction count. For the full year, private client contributed 64% of brokerage revenue, or $406,000,000, versus 62% and $366,000,000, an 11% increase in revenue year over year. For the fourth quarter, middle market and larger transaction segments together accounted for 31% of brokerage revenue at $65,000,000 compared to 38% and $77,000,000 last year.\nThe year-over-year change in revenue is attributed to a decline in transactions and dollar volume in these segments of 8%–14%, respectively, and is largely a result of fewer large transactions. Large transactions significantly outpaced the market last year, creating a very tough year-on-year comp. For the full year, middle market and larger transaction segments combined represented 32% of brokerage revenue, or $200,000,000, compared to 34% and $203,000,000 last year. Revenue from our financing business was $33,000,000 during the fourth quarter, up 6% year over year from $31,000,000 last year. The growth reflects an 8% increase in transaction volume totaling $3,700,000,000 across 507 financing transactions, which was a 19% increase year over year.\n\nThe average origination fee was down nominally due to an increase in larger deals closed in the quarter. For the full year, financing revenue was $104,000,000, a 23% increase compared to last year. This growth was driven by a 33% rise in transaction count totaling $11,900,000,000 in volume, a notable increase of 31% year over year. Our overall performance reflects the continued momentum and progress in scaling of our finance platform and success in recruiting talented producers over the past several years. Other revenue, primarily from leasing, consulting, and advisory fees, was $5,000,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to $6,000,000 in the same period last year.\nFor the full year, other revenue totaled $19,000,000 compared to $22,000,000 in the prior year. Turning now to expenses. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $229,000,000, a 2% decrease from last year on higher revenue, demonstrating our continued focus on operational efficiency. For the full year, operating expenses were $769,000,000, up 5.5% over 2024 though lower than our revenue growth rate of 8.5%. Cost of services for the quarter was $155,000,000, or 63.3% of revenue, compared to 63.2% last year. For the full year, cost of services totaled $470,000,000, or 62.3% of revenue, up slightly from 62% last year.\n\nSG&A expense for the quarter was $71,000,000, or 29% of revenue, compared to $76,000,000 in the same period last year, a decline of 7%. For the full year, SG&A totaled $286,000,000, or 38% of revenue, an improvement compared to 40% of revenue in the prior year. Our ongoing expense discipline is aimed at enhancing operating efficiency and leverage and improving profitability. For the fourth quarter, net income was $13,000,000, or $0.34 earnings per share. This compares to net income of $8,500,000, or $0.22 per share in the prior year, a significant EPS improvement of 55% year over year.\nFor the full year, net loss was $1,900,000, or $0.05 per share, which, as a reminder, includes a $0.08 per share charge for a legal reserve we took in the third quarter. This compares to a net loss of $12,400,000, or $0.32 per share in the prior year. The improvement in operating results in the year marks a meaningful inflection point signaling renewed momentum across the business. Regarding the legal matter we disclosed with Q3 earnings, there is no material update to report. We remain fully committed to pursuing relief through the appeal process. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $25,000,000, up 39% compared to $18,000,000 in the same period last year.\n\nFull year adjusted EBITDA was $25,000,000 compared to $9,000,000 in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year would have been $8,000,000 higher if not for the legal reserve recorded in the third quarter, which highlights the substantial progress in operating performance over the prior year. Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to be well capitalized with no debt and $398,000,000 in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a $17,000,000 increase over last quarter. The growth in cash was achieved while also returning $29,000,000 to shareholders during the quarter through a $10,000,000 dividend paid in October and $19,000,000 share repurchases, underscoring the strength of our cash generation as well as our disciplined capital allocation approach.\n\nEarlier this week, we announced that our Board declared a semi-annual dividend of $0.25 per share, or approximately $10,000,000, payable on 04/03/2026, to shareholders of record on 03/13/2026. During the year, we repurchased shares totaling $27,000,000 at a weighted average price of $28.77 per share. Since inception of our dividend and share repurchase programs nearly four years ago, we have returned approximately $217,000,000 in capital to shareholders. Looking ahead to 2026, we see several positive catalysts for our business, which Hessam summarized. First quarter revenue is expected to follow the usual seasonality trend and be sequentially lower than Q4.\nWhile we are encouraged by the prospect of continued momentum in the new year, our cautiously optimistic outlook is tempered by ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that could moderate the pace of transaction activity. Cost of services for the first quarter should follow the annual reset and be in the range of 60% to 61% of revenue. SG&A for the first quarter should reflect an increase year over year in absolute dollars consistent with higher agent support tied to improved revenue performance in 2025 and continued investments in technology and central services to support our sales producers.\n\nAs for taxes, the effective tax rate for the quarter and the year is expected to be in the range of 50% to 60%. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in technology and talent, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders. Our strong balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to pursue these objectives while maintaining our competitive position. With that, Operator, we can now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. You may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Blaine Matthew Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBlaine Matthew Heck: Great, thanks. Good morning. Hessam, as you alluded to, the broker group has been under a lot of pressure this week driven by concerns about AI displacement within the business and impacting the CRE sector more broadly. You talked about some of the changes that you guys have already made. But looking forward, I guess, which segments of your business could be impacted, whether that is certain deal sizes or business units. Do you think your focus on the private client group gives you guys more or less protection from AI disruption?\nHessam Nadji: Good morning, Blaine. Good to have you on the call. I was just on CNBC a few hours ago on this very topic because it is getting a lot of media attention, especially as it has impacted the commercial real estate services segment in the last 48 hours or so. And my view, and I think that of many in the industry, is that AI is here to stay. And there are almost countless ways that AI is going to improve the manual processes that are so labor intensive in our business, whether it is underwriting, data gathering, data parsing, document generation, and really all the production-related components of our business, which is significant.\n\nIf you think about the number of times a broker needs an asset analysis, a submarket analysis, a metro analysis, even before first meeting with a client, even before they have really gotten to know the client, the need to be educated in that first interaction itself creates a tremendous amount of labor and we are excited about finding scalable ways for AI to make that process a lot more efficient and a lot less costly, frankly, so that we can reallocate capital to other ways that the company can advance forward and more R&D as well as improving our margins. That is a given. The big question mark is what happens in, you know, the second wave of AI.\nI believe right now we are in the first wave of really this initial level of replacing a lot of manual tasks and labor-intensive tasks. The second wave is more interpretive, in my view, and that is where the intelligence that would be expected from AI would start to have a gray area with the expertise and the personal experience and interpretation skill set of a good broker. In commercial real estate, trying to scale that interpretive capability of AI becomes a lot more challenging because the data is disorganized. You have to have micro historical data to feed to the AI.\n\nThat is not a cookie cutter across various markets, not a cookie cutter across various asset types, and therefore, the notion that, you know, even in ways that the for-sale housing market, the residential housing market is far easier to commoditize in terms of analyzing or digitizing the valuation models or the buyer-seller matches that you can do for the for-sale housing market are very hard to transfer over in a cookie cutter fashion to commercial real estate.\nAnd one commentary I made on CNBC when I was on it a few hours ago is that you can build the exact same asset, exact same size, features, and characteristics and open for business on the exact same day across the street from each other, and 10 years later, from an investment perspective, those could be entirely different cap rates, entirely different NOIs, based on the way that they are managed, the capital improvements, and so on. So that is where the complexity of just how much interpretive power can be extracted from AI given its reliance on accurate data and the learning that the algorithms would have to do.\n\nTo answer your question, I do believe that the notion of fee pressure because of the commoditization of the data is going to be out there for a while. I think every disruption that we can think of in the last 20 years which initially was perceived to threaten intermediary value-add work and brokerage value-add work has actually helped the brokerage business. Think about it. This is deja vu for me, being in the thick of the inception of the Internet and Marcus & Millichap, Inc. really being on the forefront of embracing the Internet and embracing electronic portals because we thought it would actually enhance our value proposition and not destroy it.\nWe were one of the founding investors in LoopNet in the late 1990s, for example. So this goes back a while for us. And we take it very seriously from the standpoint of evaluating the threat to our value proposition and at the same time really focusing on the ways we can take advantage of it. You could argue, Blaine, that a single-tenant net lease that is far easier to underwrite—people say that—but even single-tenant net lease requires really good underwriting. By the way, you have to go look at the real estate.\n\nIt is not really a bond, but closer to a bond than, let us say, a shopping center or an office building or even a multifamily rental building. And those easier-to-underwrite and more homogenous assets could get further down the road of being impacted by AI and requiring less of the broker touch. However, I go back to, and this is another thing we discussed on air hours ago, I go back to the relationship component, the due diligence component, and the art of keeping the buyer, the seller, and the lender into a deal from a psychological perspective.\nThe art of managing the vendors that are on the critical path of removing contingencies or due diligence, I do not think robots are going to go around and do that anytime soon. So I really believe that we are headed for the next generation of reinventing the broker as we went through in the early 2000s because of the Internet and because of digitization of information availability. But I think it is going to make us better, and it is going to make the industry more selective and focus on the talent of the individual in their interpretive and people skills rather than commodity data gathering. Sorry for the long-winded answer, but I am very passionate about this one.\n\nBlaine Matthew Heck: No, that is very helpful for perspective and well said. Shifting gears, you guys had very strong growth in broker count this quarter. I guess a few questions around that. First, was this something that you had visibility into given your recruitment efforts? Were you expecting that level of growth this quarter? Or was there something that drove a surprise to the upside? Second, are there any specific specialties you targeted in that growth? You have been hiring more experienced brokers that can handle larger transactions, but I would have expected a larger average deal size this quarter if that was the case.\nAnd then just third, how should we think about your plans to grow headcount as we look forward into 2026?\nHessam Nadji: Very important topic, as you know, and we have messaged multiple times we have been under so much pressure because of the disruption created by the pandemic into our multi-decade tested system and really almost a unique feature of the company in the way that we have been successful in attracting new talent with no experience, training them, supporting them into becoming market leaders, that has driven the company for so long up until 02/2020. And that whole component of our system was badly disrupted because of the pandemic and then the market volatility that ensued, just elevating the dropout rates of the individuals that we hired really from 2020 on.\n\nFirst, because the market was shut down and the in-person training was not possible. And then because the market had such a huge run and then a big crash. So that volatility makes it very hard to train new people into the business. And we made a concerted effort over the last three years to increase the channels of bringing in talent, qualifying the talent. Not only have we increased the inflow of candidates, we have really upgraded the filtering of those candidates, whether it is campus recruiting, whether it is our internship program that we have more than doubled in size and organized with a very specific curriculum across the country, the expansion of the William A.\nMillichap Fellowship Program, all of which have been very successful. We started those three years ago. So it takes time for all these kinds of initiatives to produce tangible results. Everything in the business has a bit of a lag time, which is frustrating but a reality. And we did have visibility to it going into 2025. Senior management felt very strongly that the underpinnings had time to get laid and work, and it was time for us to expect better actual tangible results in 2025. It became a major focus for our local market leaders that run our offices and our division leaders, our chief revenue officers, and all the way to myself.\n\nSo we began to build a stronger candidate pool with proper standards of bringing in talent. The experienced talent that joined in 2025 usually would face a bit of a transition from whatever brand they came from. We do not expect them to repeat their three- or four-year or five-year average immediately when they get here. There is normally a six- to nine-month transition time before they rebuild the pipeline with us. So that is probably why you were questioning whether that cadre of the new salesforce additions would have already brought some business with them. I believe that we are going to see some of that in 2026 as a benefit of the experienced folks we hired in 2025.\nGoing into the new year, we are not letting up on any of the initiatives we put into place in order to produce the results we produced in 2025. Our expectations are very high going into the year just as they were in 2025. And if anything, our systems expansion of our recruiting team, which is under new leadership, are all going to help maintain the momentum.\n\nOperator: Okay. Great.\nBlaine Matthew Heck: Very comprehensive. Thank you. Last question. You mentioned continuing to explore strategic transactions. I wanted to see whether you think this latest market disruption and fear over AI displacement might bring about some opportunities for lower cost acquisitions and how you are thinking about the risk-reward of the external growth given the current concerns over disintermediation from AI? Has anything changed with respect to your appetite for add-ons or maybe the profile of those potential expansion opportunities?\nHessam Nadji: Nothing has deterred our strategy for attracting new talent, attracting boutiques, and regional firms that I believe would thrive within the MMI platform. The introduction of AI as more of a business factor enhances that. It does not, in my mind or as part of our strategy, diminish it at all. And I did want to really summarize for all of our shareholders and our analysts the attempts that we have made to diversify the platform going into 2022 and 2023. And those include companies that we looked at in the appraisal and valuation business, cost segregation business, even investment management was explored with a couple of opportunities that had come up.\n\nAnd the common theme that I have shared before was that going into 2023 and 2024, there was so much near-term uncertainty. And there was some on our part in being able to forecast the first two or three years of a performance of an acquired target. And there was so much reliance in both the valuation and the terms of the target companies on guaranteed value upfront that became the biggest obstacle that we felt very uncomfortable with in some of the deals that we looked at, given the near-term market uncertainty. As that fades, and we really believe it has faded, and as I mentioned and Steve mentioned in his commentary, we are more optimistic about 2026.\nAs the market gets closer and closer to an operating environment that we would consider fairly normal, our confidence would be higher in that the first few years of an acquisition become somewhat more predictable than 2023, 2024, and 2025 certainly were. And in retrospect, Blaine, I will have to say that the decision to pass on the vast majority of those deals was the right thing to do, knowing what has transpired and, frankly, tracking them and still being in touch and knowing how they fared. So I think we did our job in terms of being diligent with our shareholders' capital.\n\nBut the desire to diversify this platform in a way that is value-add to our existing salesforce and the core customer base we have already gotten so close to is very much there. If anything, it is more energized as the market certainty and clarity returns.\nBlaine Matthew Heck: Great. Thanks so much. I will leave it there.\nHessam Nadji: Great talking to you, Blaine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Germain with Citizens. Please proceed with your question.\nMitch Germain: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Just following up on the M&A question. Is it just market uncertainty? Or has it also been a function of either price or a cultural fit that has prevented some of these transactions from getting over the finish line?\nHessam Nadji: Hi, Mitch. I will take that one. Steve could add some comments as well. Really, all three. Culture has been the least problematic because we already do a lot of due diligence upfront as to who we want to approach that we feel is like-minded and would have compatible cultures. We really have not gotten too far down the road with a lot of targets that did not have a good culture. There is only one I can think of a meaningful size where we had to get to know them and get to know their culture, and that became in and of itself, as well as a major gap in valuation expectations and then terms, a big hurdle.\n\nWe just could not get our heads around, even if you can get the numbers result. But the bid-ask spread has been wide from our standpoint. There are others who are more aggressive and maybe more willing to take risks back in 2023–2024, and we were not, on a case-by-case basis. And then, as I mentioned, the gap in terms of guaranteed value versus earn-out. We are very focused on bringing on talent that wants to be a part of MMI for at least seven to ten years or longer. And we are not really looking to become somebody's retirement plan.\nAnd what we face is a big challenge, Mitch, I think you are very familiar with this based on our previous conversations, is that the vast majority of our targets are boutiques and regional firms that have one or two founders that started a brokerage group or a team that became somewhat of a company. And those founders, having had some decades behind them, are not really the revenue producers in most of the cases. And their current revenue producers would not participate in an acquisition from a capital event perspective. It is like, what are you really paying for?\n\nAnd in our fragmented core business, the pool of targets of any size that have a diverse revenue—kind of a, you know, stream, sources of revenue stream—are fairly rare to find. That is why our experienced producer recruiting has been much more successful. But, again, we have organized ourselves in a way where we are targeting specific spaces, specific companies, and specific groups, whether it falls under experienced professional recruiting or a quasi acquisition. Steve, anything?\nSteven F. DeGennaro: Super helpful. Yeah. Mitch, that is exactly where I was gonna go. The guarantee and not wanting to be, you know, a founder's retirement plan, that is certainly a very real factor in the brokerage business, perhaps a little bit less so in some of these adjacent spaces, but still it is a strong consideration that has kept us from consummating a handful of these deals.\n\nMitch Germain: Thank you. Are you able to—have you been able to increase your cross-sell from your financing division into your brokerage? You know, where does that stand today?\nHessam Nadji: Yes. That is a definite yes. The best example is in our IPA Capital Markets segment, where we brought in a very experienced finance professional, teamed them up with some of our most experienced sales teams. The one case that I can think of right away is our IPA Capital Markets for multifamily, where we brought in the Eisenhower Financial Group in 2022 and paired them up with our top five or seven IPA sales teams across the country. And their collaboration and joint efforts in winning business and serving the clients for both the investment sales component and financing, and then in some cases, refinancing of other properties, has been very successful in a short amount of time.\n\nOther examples include another IPA Capital Markets team we brought on board in New York that has collaborated with a number of our investment sales teams. Our loan sales division, Mission Capital, is actively either responding to leads that our sales force uncovers by talking to lenders or the other way around.\nAnd I am also happy to say that within our auction business, the channel that auction has opened both for aging inventory that is not effectively selling through conventional marketing and now can be put on an auction platform—and frankly, our head of auction would say that is too limiting of how the auction channel can be helpful to a seller even in the front end of deciding to market an asset, the right asset, that is—so both of those types of scenarios are now creating cross-selling between auction, loan sales, and our conventional finance division and our sales.\n\nMitch Germain: Got you. How do you envision 2026 performance with regards to—obviously, the market has been fairly unstable, and it appears that outside of this whole AI noise that has been impacting the share price, the market itself going into 2026, it appears that allocations are increasing, people have accepted a new pricing paradigm. It definitely seems like there is a little bit less volatility. So do you think that will begin to resonate in the financial performance of MMI, particularly in the early part of the year?\nIt has been a little bit of a, you know, kind of unstable start where you are kind of starting at a deficit in earnings and then in the fourth quarter working your way back up. Do you think that some of those losses are going to begin to narrow now that the environment stabilized a bit?\n\nHessam Nadji: Here is how I will respond to the question, Mitch. I will say that going into the early stages of 2026 is the best start of a calendar year since 2022. I will definitely say that. Because the factors that you mentioned have all occurred. In the resetting of the prices, the acceptance that a Fed miracle is not around the corner to bring interest rates way back down and basically be the Hail Mary for the pressure on values reversing after the Fed increased rates by 500 basis points. All those kinds of processes that take the market a couple of years to process and recalibrate are for the most part behind us.\nThat is not to say that 2026 or the current environment is a normal operating environment. We still have a bid-ask spread. We still have very fickle investor sentiment where the cautiousness because of the unexpected events of 2025, i.e., Liberation Day and the tariff effect, the six-week shock to the capital markets that we absorbed last week, has a lot of our clients asking themselves, what is around the corner? What else could happen? And the fact that interest rates have been sticky around the 4% yield on the 10-year Treasury has not been all that constructive.\n\nWe really do not see a surge in activity and a big boost in investor sentiment unless the 10-year gets closer to 3.5%. And so expecting it to be range bound around that 4% and expecting this sort of measured incremental improvement in market sentiment and therefore activity is, I think, reasonable for 2026. Certainly not a hockey stick where we can declare the end of uncertainty and announce the beginning of certainty, because there are still just these lingering tentacles of what has happened because of the Fed action, because of the inflation pressure, and still price discovery.\nMitch, there are multiple markets where we are just beginning to see the level of distress—what I will call situational distress, not systemic big portfolios being sold off by lenders at big discounts—but actual individual assets, small portfolios, with situational distress where the property was purchased with very aggressive financing, very aggressive underwriting, and that did not materialize in the near term, and the loan is terming out or a longer-term loan is maturing. Those assets only rescue capital, or they have to be sold at a significantly lower price than they traded last time.\n\nAnd our team is actively working with countless owners on working out those situations that are not yet translating into immediate transactions but will in the next 12 to 18 months. So it is not a smooth, normalized environment. There is still a lot of troubleshooting. Deals are taking longer. Our marketing timelines have not come in that much. And what we benefited from is just increasing our exclusive inventory through a lot more focus on being out talking to clients and really trying to make a market.\nSo a lot of the incremental improvement, which we are frustrated with because it should be even better, is coming from the fact that most of it was created by sweat and blood, not so much a hockey stick relief type of a trend in the marketplace.\n\nSteven F. DeGennaro: Yeah, and I will just add, Mitch, that, as we have talked about, there is a certain amount of fixed costs that are embedded into our business model—loan amortization on capital to attract and retain producers—but as the revenue grows, it only really takes even modest revenue growth before you start seeing operating leverage flow down through our financials. That is not a forecast of any sort, but just a reminder that as revenue starts to recover, as the market starts to recover, revenue follows. The impact on our operating income has a pretty solid flow-through.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. Hessam Nadji, I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nHessam Nadji: Thank you, Operator, and thank you, everybody, for participating on our call.

With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to CEO, Hessam Nadji.\n\nStory Continues\nThank you, Jacques. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year end 2025 earnings call. I am pleased to report MMI's continued recovery from one of the most complex and prolonged market disruptions on record with 2025 revenue growth of 8.5% and adjusted EBITDA improving to $25,000,000 compared to $9,000,000 in 2024. The fourth quarter particularly showed the strength of our resolve and execution as we set out to beat the exceptional 2024 fourth quarter which had been propelled by a significant drop in interest rates. Despite entering 2025 without the benefit of lower interest rates, I am proud to report that we beat the tough comp by 2% on the top line and significantly improved profitability.\n\nWe drove these results through elevated client outreach, tapping our extended lender network, and taking advantage of key market improvements despite the absence of lower interest rates. A larger than expected resurrection and closing of deals that had been delayed or canceled early in the quarter and a lift in urgency among our private clients deciding to take advantage of bonus depreciation by year end were key factors in the late stage rally. Although the bonus depreciation provision of the new tax law does not phase out, its advantage became a stronger motivating factor in getting deals closed in the final period of the year.\nI am also pleased to report that 2025 marked the strongest growth in our salesforce in seven years with nearly 100 net additions of brokerage and financing professionals. Various initiatives to combat the unusual pandemic and post-pandemic forces that had elevated our new agent dropout rate culminated in this critical return to growth. The additions include a steady cadre of experienced individuals and teams that continue to choose MMI as the ideal platform for taking their career to the next level. We are very encouraged by last year's hiring results and a strong candidate pipeline going into 2026. Throughout 2025, we maintained our market leadership position by transaction count, completing nearly 9,000 transactions totaling over $50,000,000,000 in volume.\n\nThis translates to more than 35 transactions per business day, reinforcing a consistent expansion of client relationships and enabling our team to move capital across markets and property types. Looking back, three key factors impacted our performance in 2025, all of which also bode well for the outlook in 2026. First, capital markets and investor sentiment improved particularly in the second half of the year after recovering from the initial shock of Liberation Day. Despite a cautious Federal Reserve that lowered rates at a much slower pace than anticipated, lender spreads compressed by 75 to 100 basis points and loan-to-value ratios expanded.\nMany lenders have repaired balance sheets, restructured, and/or resolved a large portion of maturities, and have more capacity as transaction volume has picked up. Second, momentum in our private client and middle market segments picked up last year, as prices finally began to adjust and regional banks and credit unions became more active. MMI's $1 to $20,000,000 transaction count and revenue each grew 12% as we started to reestablish our traditional advantage in these segments. This part of the market not only comprises the vast majority of commercial property stock and transactions, but it is also poised for more activity as a narrowing bid-ask spread releases pent-up supply from sellers who previously were hanging on to assets.\n\nThird, our financing business continues a strong trajectory with revenue up 23% in 2025, after growing 26% in 2024. This solid pace is the result of our expanded cadre of experienced financing professionals and the team's ability to access over 420 separate lenders last year. Our team of nearly 100 finance professionals is interconnected through our proprietary technology which is integrated with our expansive lender relationships. This tech-enabled combination secures the most optimal financing options available in the marketplace. MMCC and IPA Capital Markets closed over 1,600 transactions for a volume of nearly $12,000,000,000 which includes a $2,300,000,000 portion placed with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, primarily through our strategic alliance with M&T Bank.\n\nAgency financing has been one of the fastest growing segments of our business thanks to the talent acquisition and rapidly growing collaboration we have managed to pull off between our finance professionals and our sales teams. The only segment that was off last year was our larger transactions valued at $20,000,000 or more which declined by 13%. This is primarily driven by a tough comparison to 2024 when our institutional segment led the recovery with a 28% revenue increase including an 88% surge in 2024. Institutional apartment sales, which showed strength in 2024, eased as the acute flight to safety limited the buyer pool for lower tier assets and secondary markets.\nWhile our IPA division is well positioned to continue expanding in the institutional arena, some volatility is to be expected as a number of metros grapple with oversupply. The ripple effect of high vacancies, particularly for multifamily in these metros, is leading to a rise in underperforming assets that are not yet priced to clear the market. In summary, we are pleased with the significant improvement in the company's key metrics; however, we are laser focused on driving further momentum in the pace of recovery and capturing the substantial growth runway ahead of us.\n\nWe enter 2026 with greater clarity on the path to achieving this thanks to a largely recalibrated marketplace and our unwavering conviction in our client value proposition. Building on that strengthening position, we remain disciplined in our approach to strategic investments while maintaining prudent cost controls. The investments we have made over the past several years in talent retention and acquisition, technology, infrastructure, and branding are beginning to show leverage as the revenue tide turns. As I have mentioned on previous calls, the expensing of capital investments has been an outsized drag on earnings since the start of the market disruption in 2023, given the hampered revenue production of the past few years.\nAs market conditions and broker productivity improve, so will the production level of the talent pools we have retained and added to over the past several years. As a critical part of our technology strategy to leverage AI and drive efficiency, the company's centralized back office and marketing center called Brokerage Transaction Services, or BTS, is intensifying its reliance on third-party services at a lower cost while we also begin to leverage various AI applications to our benefit. These efforts are concentrated in financial analysis, document generation, underwriting, and lead scoring. All of these efforts are showing promising results but need significant advancement in the AI capacity and the use of historical data mining for accuracy and scalability.\n\nHessam Nadji: We expect and fully embrace the opportunity that AI has opened for massive efficiency in virtually all aspects of property analysis, underwriting, client targeting, and outreach. An era of higher throughput at a much lower cost is emerging, and our goal is to lead this tremendous productivity gain over time. However, we do not expect AI to disintermediate the function of a value-added broker given the expertise, building-by-building nuances, and buyer-seller relationships that ultimately drive the commercial real estate industry. In our view, the broker of the future will be armed with an array of additional analytics, with more efficiency in a way that will help clients create value.\nAt the same time, value-added offerings such as our auction services and loan sales division continue to gain traction, generating direct incremental revenue and increasing sales and financing opportunities through collaboration with our sales force. Looking ahead, we enter 2026 with greater optimism driven by several positive market fundamentals. Interest rates, while still elevated, have stabilized, which provides a more predictable valuation benchmark. Simply stated, values have to adjust to the new normal in the cost of debt, and they are doing so. The price corrections over the past three years combined with a major pullback in new construction are creating compelling investment opportunities, especially on a replacement cost basis.\n\nCap rates are up 85 to 110 basis points on average since 2022, and prices are down roughly 20% on average. This, combined with lower all-in interest rates driven largely by lower lender spreads, should further bolster investor demand and capital flows in 2026. Despite expectations of a more accommodative Federal Reserve, inflation pressures and trade-related variables would likely limit the Fed's ability to significantly lower rates. While the labor market is slowing faster than expected, the incoming Fed chair will most likely face the same obstacles to lowering rates. Nevertheless, we expect last year's transaction market improvements to continue as time narrows the bid-ask spread and facilitates the sale of many delayed trades.\n2026 is a milestone year for all of us at MMI as we celebrate the company's 55-year anniversary. Many aspects of the company's culture that retain and attract the best of the best in brokerage, financing, management, and support functions find their cornerstones in the company's founding principles that still drive us today. These include bringing efficiency and value, liquidity, and certainty to an otherwise fragmented market, measuring our success by our clients' results, and creating long-term and rewarding careers for all team members at Marcus & Millichap, Inc. As we mark this important milestone, all eyes are on the future and our quest to lead in an ever-changing industry.\n\nOur multi-pronged growth strategy includes expanding our leadership in the private client market, further penetrating the institutional segment through IPA, and accelerating the scaling of our financing, auction, loan sales, and client advisory services. Given our disciplined approach to acquisitions, recent attempts to acquire additional financing boutiques, appraisal and valuation firms, and complementary adjunct businesses such as investment management and cost segregation have not yet come to fruition. However, they will in time as the company is committed to providing an array of additional services that align with our dominance in investment brokerage and finance. Our ultimate goal is to enhance our offerings to a client base we have come to know extremely well throughout the years.\n\nPowering this vision is MMI's stellar balance sheet with nearly $400,000,000 in cash, reinforcing our ample purchasing power for strategic acquisitions, which we continue to pursue. Most recently, we have engaged in multiple large-scale explorations that would enable us to expand our financing business more rapidly. We are proud to have balanced strong liquidity and purchasing power with a consistent return of capital to shareholders, with $47,000,000 provided in dividends and share repurchases executed in 2025. As we look to the future, we are excited about a new real estate cycle and the vast opportunities ahead for expanding our market presence and revenue diversification to enhance long-term value. I will now turn the call over to Steven F.\n\nDeGennaro for more details on our results. Steve?\nSteven F. DeGennaro: Thank you, Hessam. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $244,000,000, an increase of 2% compared to $240,000,000 for the same period in the prior year. As Hessam mentioned, year-over-year comparisons in Q4 are against an exceptionally strong fourth quarter last year. For the full year, total revenue was $755,000,000, up 8.5% compared to $696,000,000 last year. Breaking down revenue by segment, real estate brokerage commissions for the fourth quarter were $205,000,000, moderately exceeding last year's tough comp and accounting for 84% of quarterly revenue. We completed 1,902 brokerage transactions with a total volume of $11,800,000,000 for the quarter.\nWhile transaction dollar volume was lower by 4%, transaction deal count was up by more than 9% over last year, and the average commission rate was 1.7%. The relative increase in private client transactions contributed to a 7% decrease in the average fee per transaction given the higher mix of smaller deals. For the full year 2025, revenue from real estate brokerage commissions was $633,000,000 compared to $590,000,000 last year, an increase of 7%. We completed a total of 6,038 brokerage transactions, up 11%, with total volume of $35,000,000,000, up 3.5% compared to prior year. For the year, average transaction size was $5,800,000 compared to $6,200,000 in the prior year, reflecting the pickup in private client activity.\n\nWithin brokerage for the quarter, our core private client business accounted for 65% of brokerage revenue, or $133,000,000, up from 59% and $120,000,000 in the same period last year. Private client transactions grew 13% in volume and 10% in transaction count. For the full year, private client contributed 64% of brokerage revenue, or $406,000,000, versus 62% and $366,000,000, an 11% increase in revenue year over year. For the fourth quarter, middle market and larger transaction segments together accounted for 31% of brokerage revenue at $65,000,000 compared to 38% and $77,000,000 last year.\nThe year-over-year change in revenue is attributed to a decline in transactions and dollar volume in these segments of 8%–14%, respectively, and is largely a result of fewer large transactions. Large transactions significantly outpaced the market last year, creating a very tough year-on-year comp. For the full year, middle market and larger transaction segments combined represented 32% of brokerage revenue, or $200,000,000, compared to 34% and $203,000,000 last year. Revenue from our financing business was $33,000,000 during the fourth quarter, up 6% year over year from $31,000,000 last year. The growth reflects an 8% increase in transaction volume totaling $3,700,000,000 across 507 financing transactions, which was a 19% increase year over year.\n\nThe average origination fee was down nominally due to an increase in larger deals closed in the quarter. For the full year, financing revenue was $104,000,000, a 23% increase compared to last year. This growth was driven by a 33% rise in transaction count totaling $11,900,000,000 in volume, a notable increase of 31% year over year. Our overall performance reflects the continued momentum and progress in scaling of our finance platform and success in recruiting talented producers over the past several years. Other revenue, primarily from leasing, consulting, and advisory fees, was $5,000,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to $6,000,000 in the same period last year.\nFor the full year, other revenue totaled $19,000,000 compared to $22,000,000 in the prior year. Turning now to expenses. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $229,000,000, a 2% decrease from last year on higher revenue, demonstrating our continued focus on operational efficiency. For the full year, operating expenses were $769,000,000, up 5.5% over 2024 though lower than our revenue growth rate of 8.5%. Cost of services for the quarter was $155,000,000, or 63.3% of revenue, compared to 63.2% last year. For the full year, cost of services totaled $470,000,000, or 62.3% of revenue, up slightly from 62% last year.\n\nSG&A expense for the quarter was $71,000,000, or 29% of revenue, compared to $76,000,000 in the same period last year, a decline of 7%. For the full year, SG&A totaled $286,000,000, or 38% of revenue, an improvement compared to 40% of revenue in the prior year. Our ongoing expense discipline is aimed at enhancing operating efficiency and leverage and improving profitability. For the fourth quarter, net income was $13,000,000, or $0.34 earnings per share. This compares to net income of $8,500,000, or $0.22 per share in the prior year, a significant EPS improvement of 55% year over year.\nFor the full year, net loss was $1,900,000, or $0.05 per share, which, as a reminder, includes a $0.08 per share charge for a legal reserve we took in the third quarter. This compares to a net loss of $12,400,000, or $0.32 per share in the prior year. The improvement in operating results in the year marks a meaningful inflection point signaling renewed momentum across the business. Regarding the legal matter we disclosed with Q3 earnings, there is no material update to report. We remain fully committed to pursuing relief through the appeal process. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $25,000,000, up 39% compared to $18,000,000 in the same period last year.\n\nFull year adjusted EBITDA was $25,000,000 compared to $9,000,000 in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year would have been $8,000,000 higher if not for the legal reserve recorded in the third quarter, which highlights the substantial progress in operating performance over the prior year. Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to be well capitalized with no debt and $398,000,000 in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a $17,000,000 increase over last quarter. The growth in cash was achieved while also returning $29,000,000 to shareholders during the quarter through a $10,000,000 dividend paid in October and $19,000,000 share repurchases, underscoring the strength of our cash generation as well as our disciplined capital allocation approach.\n\nEarlier this week, we announced that our Board declared a semi-annual dividend of $0.25 per share, or approximately $10,000,000, payable on 04/03/2026, to shareholders of record on 03/13/2026. During the year, we repurchased shares totaling $27,000,000 at a weighted average price of $28.77 per share. Since inception of our dividend and share repurchase programs nearly four years ago, we have returned approximately $217,000,000 in capital to shareholders. Looking ahead to 2026, we see several positive catalysts for our business, which Hessam summarized. First quarter revenue is expected to follow the usual seasonality trend and be sequentially lower than Q4.\nWhile we are encouraged by the prospect of continued momentum in the new year, our cautiously optimistic outlook is tempered by ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that could moderate the pace of transaction activity. Cost of services for the first quarter should follow the annual reset and be in the range of 60% to 61% of revenue. SG&A for the first quarter should reflect an increase year over year in absolute dollars consistent with higher agent support tied to improved revenue performance in 2025 and continued investments in technology and central services to support our sales producers.\n\nAs for taxes, the effective tax rate for the quarter and the year is expected to be in the range of 50% to 60%. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in technology and talent, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders. Our strong balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to pursue these objectives while maintaining our competitive position. With that, Operator, we can now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. You may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Blaine Matthew Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBlaine Matthew Heck: Great, thanks. Good morning. Hessam, as you alluded to, the broker group has been under a lot of pressure this week driven by concerns about AI displacement within the business and impacting the CRE sector more broadly. You talked about some of the changes that you guys have already made. But looking forward, I guess, which segments of your business could be impacted, whether that is certain deal sizes or business units. Do you think your focus on the private client group gives you guys more or less protection from AI disruption?\nHessam Nadji: Good morning, Blaine. Good to have you on the call. I was just on CNBC a few hours ago on this very topic because it is getting a lot of media attention, especially as it has impacted the commercial real estate services segment in the last 48 hours or so. And my view, and I think that of many in the industry, is that AI is here to stay. And there are almost countless ways that AI is going to improve the manual processes that are so labor intensive in our business, whether it is underwriting, data gathering, data parsing, document generation, and really all the production-related components of our business, which is significant.\n\nIf you think about the number of times a broker needs an asset analysis, a submarket analysis, a metro analysis, even before first meeting with a client, even before they have really gotten to know the client, the need to be educated in that first interaction itself creates a tremendous amount of labor and we are excited about finding scalable ways for AI to make that process a lot more efficient and a lot less costly, frankly, so that we can reallocate capital to other ways that the company can advance forward and more R&D as well as improving our margins. That is a given. The big question mark is what happens in, you know, the second wave of AI.\nI believe right now we are in the first wave of really this initial level of replacing a lot of manual tasks and labor-intensive tasks. The second wave is more interpretive, in my view, and that is where the intelligence that would be expected from AI would start to have a gray area with the expertise and the personal experience and interpretation skill set of a good broker. In commercial real estate, trying to scale that interpretive capability of AI becomes a lot more challenging because the data is disorganized. You have to have micro historical data to feed to the AI.\n\nThat is not a cookie cutter across various markets, not a cookie cutter across various asset types, and therefore, the notion that, you know, even in ways that the for-sale housing market, the residential housing market is far easier to commoditize in terms of analyzing or digitizing the valuation models or the buyer-seller matches that you can do for the for-sale housing market are very hard to transfer over in a cookie cutter fashion to commercial real estate.\nAnd one commentary I made on CNBC when I was on it a few hours ago is that you can build the exact same asset, exact same size, features, and characteristics and open for business on the exact same day across the street from each other, and 10 years later, from an investment perspective, those could be entirely different cap rates, entirely different NOIs, based on the way that they are managed, the capital improvements, and so on. So that is where the complexity of just how much interpretive power can be extracted from AI given its reliance on accurate data and the learning that the algorithms would have to do.\n\nTo answer your question, I do believe that the notion of fee pressure because of the commoditization of the data is going to be out there for a while. I think every disruption that we can think of in the last 20 years which initially was perceived to threaten intermediary value-add work and brokerage value-add work has actually helped the brokerage business. Think about it. This is deja vu for me, being in the thick of the inception of the Internet and Marcus & Millichap, Inc. really being on the forefront of embracing the Internet and embracing electronic portals because we thought it would actually enhance our value proposition and not destroy it.\nWe were one of the founding investors in LoopNet in the late 1990s, for example. So this goes back a while for us. And we take it very seriously from the standpoint of evaluating the threat to our value proposition and at the same time really focusing on the ways we can take advantage of it. You could argue, Blaine, that a single-tenant net lease that is far easier to underwrite—people say that—but even single-tenant net lease requires really good underwriting. By the way, you have to go look at the real estate.\n\nIt is not really a bond, but closer to a bond than, let us say, a shopping center or an office building or even a multifamily rental building. And those easier-to-underwrite and more homogenous assets could get further down the road of being impacted by AI and requiring less of the broker touch. However, I go back to, and this is another thing we discussed on air hours ago, I go back to the relationship component, the due diligence component, and the art of keeping the buyer, the seller, and the lender into a deal from a psychological perspective.\nThe art of managing the vendors that are on the critical path of removing contingencies or due diligence, I do not think robots are going to go around and do that anytime soon. So I really believe that we are headed for the next generation of reinventing the broker as we went through in the early 2000s because of the Internet and because of digitization of information availability. But I think it is going to make us better, and it is going to make the industry more selective and focus on the talent of the individual in their interpretive and people skills rather than commodity data gathering. Sorry for the long-winded answer, but I am very passionate about this one.\n\nBlaine Matthew Heck: No, that is very helpful for perspective and well said. Shifting gears, you guys had very strong growth in broker count this quarter. I guess a few questions around that. First, was this something that you had visibility into given your recruitment efforts? Were you expecting that level of growth this quarter? Or was there something that drove a surprise to the upside? Second, are there any specific specialties you targeted in that growth? You have been hiring more experienced brokers that can handle larger transactions, but I would have expected a larger average deal size this quarter if that was the case.\nAnd then just third, how should we think about your plans to grow headcount as we look forward into 2026?\nHessam Nadji: Very important topic, as you know, and we have messaged multiple times we have been under so much pressure because of the disruption created by the pandemic into our multi-decade tested system and really almost a unique feature of the company in the way that we have been successful in attracting new talent with no experience, training them, supporting them into becoming market leaders, that has driven the company for so long up until 02/2020. And that whole component of our system was badly disrupted because of the pandemic and then the market volatility that ensued, just elevating the dropout rates of the individuals that we hired really from 2020 on.\n\nFirst, because the market was shut down and the in-person training was not possible. And then because the market had such a huge run and then a big crash. So that volatility makes it very hard to train new people into the business. And we made a concerted effort over the last three years to increase the channels of bringing in talent, qualifying the talent. Not only have we increased the inflow of candidates, we have really upgraded the filtering of those candidates, whether it is campus recruiting, whether it is our internship program that we have more than doubled in size and organized with a very specific curriculum across the country, the expansion of the William A.\nMillichap Fellowship Program, all of which have been very successful. We started those three years ago. So it takes time for all these kinds of initiatives to produce tangible results. Everything in the business has a bit of a lag time, which is frustrating but a reality. And we did have visibility to it going into 2025. Senior management felt very strongly that the underpinnings had time to get laid and work, and it was time for us to expect better actual tangible results in 2025. It became a major focus for our local market leaders that run our offices and our division leaders, our chief revenue officers, and all the way to myself.\n\nSo we began to build a stronger candidate pool with proper standards of bringing in talent. The experienced talent that joined in 2025 usually would face a bit of a transition from whatever brand they came from. We do not expect them to repeat their three- or four-year or five-year average immediately when they get here. There is normally a six- to nine-month transition time before they rebuild the pipeline with us. So that is probably why you were questioning whether that cadre of the new salesforce additions would have already brought some business with them. I believe that we are going to see some of that in 2026 as a benefit of the experienced folks we hired in 2025.\nGoing into the new year, we are not letting up on any of the initiatives we put into place in order to produce the results we produced in 2025. Our expectations are very high going into the year just as they were in 2025. And if anything, our systems expansion of our recruiting team, which is under new leadership, are all going to help maintain the momentum.\n\nOperator: Okay. Great.\nBlaine Matthew Heck: Very comprehensive. Thank you. Last question. You mentioned continuing to explore strategic transactions. I wanted to see whether you think this latest market disruption and fear over AI displacement might bring about some opportunities for lower cost acquisitions and how you are thinking about the risk-reward of the external growth given the current concerns over disintermediation from AI? Has anything changed with respect to your appetite for add-ons or maybe the profile of those potential expansion opportunities?\nHessam Nadji: Nothing has deterred our strategy for attracting new talent, attracting boutiques, and regional firms that I believe would thrive within the MMI platform. The introduction of AI as more of a business factor enhances that. It does not, in my mind or as part of our strategy, diminish it at all. And I did want to really summarize for all of our shareholders and our analysts the attempts that we have made to diversify the platform going into 2022 and 2023. And those include companies that we looked at in the appraisal and valuation business, cost segregation business, even investment management was explored with a couple of opportunities that had come up.\n\nAnd the common theme that I have shared before was that going into 2023 and 2024, there was so much near-term uncertainty. And there was some on our part in being able to forecast the first two or three years of a performance of an acquired target. And there was so much reliance in both the valuation and the terms of the target companies on guaranteed value upfront that became the biggest obstacle that we felt very uncomfortable with in some of the deals that we looked at, given the near-term market uncertainty. As that fades, and we really believe it has faded, and as I mentioned and Steve mentioned in his commentary, we are more optimistic about 2026.\nAs the market gets closer and closer to an operating environment that we would consider fairly normal, our confidence would be higher in that the first few years of an acquisition become somewhat more predictable than 2023, 2024, and 2025 certainly were. And in retrospect, Blaine, I will have to say that the decision to pass on the vast majority of those deals was the right thing to do, knowing what has transpired and, frankly, tracking them and still being in touch and knowing how they fared. So I think we did our job in terms of being diligent with our shareholders' capital.\n\nBut the desire to diversify this platform in a way that is value-add to our existing salesforce and the core customer base we have already gotten so close to is very much there. If anything, it is more energized as the market certainty and clarity returns.\nBlaine Matthew Heck: Great. Thanks so much. I will leave it there.\nHessam Nadji: Great talking to you, Blaine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Germain with Citizens. Please proceed with your question.\nMitch Germain: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Just following up on the M&A question. Is it just market uncertainty? Or has it also been a function of either price or a cultural fit that has prevented some of these transactions from getting over the finish line?\nHessam Nadji: Hi, Mitch. I will take that one. Steve could add some comments as well. Really, all three. Culture has been the least problematic because we already do a lot of due diligence upfront as to who we want to approach that we feel is like-minded and would have compatible cultures. We really have not gotten too far down the road with a lot of targets that did not have a good culture. There is only one I can think of a meaningful size where we had to get to know them and get to know their culture, and that became in and of itself, as well as a major gap in valuation expectations and then terms, a big hurdle.\n\nWe just could not get our heads around, even if you can get the numbers result. But the bid-ask spread has been wide from our standpoint. There are others who are more aggressive and maybe more willing to take risks back in 2023–2024, and we were not, on a case-by-case basis. And then, as I mentioned, the gap in terms of guaranteed value versus earn-out. We are very focused on bringing on talent that wants to be a part of MMI for at least seven to ten years or longer. And we are not really looking to become somebody's retirement plan.\nAnd what we face is a big challenge, Mitch, I think you are very familiar with this based on our previous conversations, is that the vast majority of our targets are boutiques and regional firms that have one or two founders that started a brokerage group or a team that became somewhat of a company. And those founders, having had some decades behind them, are not really the revenue producers in most of the cases. And their current revenue producers would not participate in an acquisition from a capital event perspective. It is like, what are you really paying for?\n\nAnd in our fragmented core business, the pool of targets of any size that have a diverse revenue—kind of a, you know, stream, sources of revenue stream—are fairly rare to find. That is why our experienced producer recruiting has been much more successful. But, again, we have organized ourselves in a way where we are targeting specific spaces, specific companies, and specific groups, whether it falls under experienced professional recruiting or a quasi acquisition. Steve, anything?\nSteven F. DeGennaro: Super helpful. Yeah. Mitch, that is exactly where I was gonna go. The guarantee and not wanting to be, you know, a founder's retirement plan, that is certainly a very real factor in the brokerage business, perhaps a little bit less so in some of these adjacent spaces, but still it is a strong consideration that has kept us from consummating a handful of these deals.\n\nMitch Germain: Thank you. Are you able to—have you been able to increase your cross-sell from your financing division into your brokerage? You know, where does that stand today?\nHessam Nadji: Yes. That is a definite yes. The best example is in our IPA Capital Markets segment, where we brought in a very experienced finance professional, teamed them up with some of our most experienced sales teams. The one case that I can think of right away is our IPA Capital Markets for multifamily, where we brought in the Eisenhower Financial Group in 2022 and paired them up with our top five or seven IPA sales teams across the country. And their collaboration and joint efforts in winning business and serving the clients for both the investment sales component and financing, and then in some cases, refinancing of other properties, has been very successful in a short amount of time.\n\nOther examples include another IPA Capital Markets team we brought on board in New York that has collaborated with a number of our investment sales teams. Our loan sales division, Mission Capital, is actively either responding to leads that our sales force uncovers by talking to lenders or the other way around.\nAnd I am also happy to say that within our auction business, the channel that auction has opened both for aging inventory that is not effectively selling through conventional marketing and now can be put on an auction platform—and frankly, our head of auction would say that is too limiting of how the auction channel can be helpful to a seller even in the front end of deciding to market an asset, the right asset, that is—so both of those types of scenarios are now creating cross-selling between auction, loan sales, and our conventional finance division and our sales.\n\nMitch Germain: Got you. How do you envision 2026 performance with regards to—obviously, the market has been fairly unstable, and it appears that outside of this whole AI noise that has been impacting the share price, the market itself going into 2026, it appears that allocations are increasing, people have accepted a new pricing paradigm. It definitely seems like there is a little bit less volatility. So do you think that will begin to resonate in the financial performance of MMI, particularly in the early part of the year?\nIt has been a little bit of a, you know, kind of unstable start where you are kind of starting at a deficit in earnings and then in the fourth quarter working your way back up. Do you think that some of those losses are going to begin to narrow now that the environment stabilized a bit?\n\nHessam Nadji: Here is how I will respond to the question, Mitch. I will say that going into the early stages of 2026 is the best start of a calendar year since 2022. I will definitely say that. Because the factors that you mentioned have all occurred. In the resetting of the prices, the acceptance that a Fed miracle is not around the corner to bring interest rates way back down and basically be the Hail Mary for the pressure on values reversing after the Fed increased rates by 500 basis points. All those kinds of processes that take the market a couple of years to process and recalibrate are for the most part behind us.\nThat is not to say that 2026 or the current environment is a normal operating environment. We still have a bid-ask spread. We still have very fickle investor sentiment where the cautiousness because of the unexpected events of 2025, i.e., Liberation Day and the tariff effect, the six-week shock to the capital markets that we absorbed last week, has a lot of our clients asking themselves, what is around the corner? What else could happen? And the fact that interest rates have been sticky around the 4% yield on the 10-year Treasury has not been all that constructive.\n\nWe really do not see a surge in activity and a big boost in investor sentiment unless the 10-year gets closer to 3.5%. And so expecting it to be range bound around that 4% and expecting this sort of measured incremental improvement in market sentiment and therefore activity is, I think, reasonable for 2026. Certainly not a hockey stick where we can declare the end of uncertainty and announce the beginning of certainty, because there are still just these lingering tentacles of what has happened because of the Fed action, because of the inflation pressure, and still price discovery.\nMitch, there are multiple markets where we are just beginning to see the level of distress—what I will call situational distress, not systemic big portfolios being sold off by lenders at big discounts—but actual individual assets, small portfolios, with situational distress where the property was purchased with very aggressive financing, very aggressive underwriting, and that did not materialize in the near term, and the loan is terming out or a longer-term loan is maturing. Those assets only rescue capital, or they have to be sold at a significantly lower price than they traded last time.\n\nAnd our team is actively working with countless owners on working out those situations that are not yet translating into immediate transactions but will in the next 12 to 18 months. So it is not a smooth, normalized environment. There is still a lot of troubleshooting. Deals are taking longer. Our marketing timelines have not come in that much. And what we benefited from is just increasing our exclusive inventory through a lot more focus on being out talking to clients and really trying to make a market.\nSo a lot of the incremental improvement, which we are frustrated with because it should be even better, is coming from the fact that most of it was created by sweat and blood, not so much a hockey stick relief type of a trend in the marketplace.\n\nSteven F. DeGennaro: Yeah, and I will just add, Mitch, that, as we have talked about, there is a certain amount of fixed costs that are embedded into our business model—loan amortization on capital to attract and retain producers—but as the revenue grows, it only really takes even modest revenue growth before you start seeing operating leverage flow down through our financials. That is not a forecast of any sort, but just a reminder that as revenue starts to recover, as the market starts to recover, revenue follows. The impact on our operating income has a pretty solid flow-through.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. Hessam Nadji, I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nHessam Nadji: Thank you, Operator, and thank you, everybody, for participating on our call.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nIn HelloNation, Landscaping Expert Jeff Elshoff Prepares Homeowners for a Successful Patio Installation\n\nPR Newswire\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:11 AM PST 4 min read\n\nTRAVERSE CITY, Mich. , Feb. 13, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- What should homeowners consider before starting a patio installation? According to a HelloNation article featuring Jeff Elshoff of Twin Bay Landscaping, planning is the key to success and the best patio design starts long before construction. By thinking carefully about patio location, drainage, and how sunlight and shade move across your yard, you can create an outdoor space that is both beautiful and built to last.\n\nThe article emphasizes that installing a patio transforms an outdoor space into an area for relaxation, dining, and entertainment. But before any stones or pavers are laid, evaluating the site is essential. The right patio location makes a difference in comfort and functionality. A patio that looks perfect on paper can become too hot, too windy, or too damp once built. Elshoff advises walking your yard at various times of day to see how sunlight and shade shift. A west-facing patio might get uncomfortably hot during summer afternoons, while a shaded area near the house may provide more comfort throughout the day.\nDrainage is another critical factor in patio installation. Water should always flow away from both the patio surface and the home's foundation. Poor drainage can cause pooling, erosion, and long-term damage to pavers or concrete. Low-lying areas of a yard should be avoided, or corrected with grading and proper drainage solutions. Installing a compacted gravel base or using drainage channels helps direct water away efficiently. According to Elshoff, managing water flow early in the patio design prevents costly maintenance later.\n\nWind exposure also plays an important role in determining the best patio location. Observing how breezes move through your yard for several days can reveal which areas are most exposed. Positioning seating or cooking zones near natural windbreaks like trees, hedges, or fences can improve comfort and reduce gusts. In open spaces, adding a pergola or privacy screen can provide protection from both wind and sun while visually defining the area. Considering wind and light together makes your outdoor space more inviting and usable year-round.\nThe connection between the patio and the house is another key design detail. Placing the patio near the kitchen or main living area encourages everyday use and smooth traffic flow. Easy access simplifies carrying food and furniture, while maintaining a comfortable distance reduces heat or smoke from cooking. The article notes that creating a pathway using the same material as the patio surface unifies the look and ties the outdoor space naturally to the home's design.\n\nStory Continues\nMaterial selection also defines the success of any patio installation. Concrete, pavers, brick, and natural stone each offer different benefits. Concrete patios are low-maintenance and provide a clean, modern appearance. Pavers allow for flexibility in layout and can be replaced individually if damaged. Natural stone delivers timeless character and pairs beautifully with landscaping, though it may require occasional sealing. The right choice depends on personal style, climate, and the desired level of maintenance. Selecting materials suited to your weather conditions helps ensure long-term durability.\n\nFor homeowners in colder climates, freeze-thaw cycles are another important consideration. A well-prepared gravel base helps prevent cracking and shifting during seasonal temperature changes. Using materials rated for your region's climate protects against wear and uneven settling. Elshoff points out that a professional installer can assess soil and site conditions to determine the best patio design and materials for your specific location.\nLighting and landscaping complete the patio's functionality and charm. Low-voltage or solar lighting makes evening gatherings safe and comfortable while highlighting design features. Surrounding the patio with native plants or shrubs adds natural beauty and defines the edges of the space. For areas with full sun, shade structures or umbrellas can provide relief and extend use throughout the day. Integrating lighting and landscaping from the start ensures that the patio feels intentional and cohesive within the broader outdoor space.\n\nBefore finalizing any plans, Elshoff recommends taking time to visualize the design in your yard. Mark the potential patio location with garden hoses or stakes to test size and shape. Sit in those areas at different times of day to experience how sunlight and shade change. This simple exercise helps homeowners make informed choices about comfort, layout, and usability.\nUltimately, the HelloNation article concludes that successful patio installation depends on observation and preparation. Choosing the right patio location, addressing drainage needs, and understanding sunlight and shade patterns help create an outdoor space that enhances both lifestyle and property value. When homeowners take time to plan carefully, their patios not only look beautiful but also function perfectly through every season.\n\nThe article, What to Know Before Installing a Patio , features insights from Landscaping Expert Jeff Elshoff in HelloNation.\nAbout HelloNation\nHelloNation is a premier media platform that connects readers with trusted professionals and businesses across various industries.

Dexcom’s Q4 and full year 2025 performance was in line with its preliminary financials as released on 12 January.\nDexcom’s share price on the Nasdaq stock exchange saw a slight decline to $64.92 at market open on 13 February versus $65.08 previously. However, shares soon rallied, rising by over 8% by mid-morning. Dexcom has a market cap of $25.38bn.\nReflecting on the company’s onward plans to advance business operations, Dexcom’s CEO Jake Leach shared during a conference call that the company has several key aims for 2026.\n\nThese include building greater awareness of the new G7 15-day device, which launched in the US in December 2025, and advancing customer experience, both for users of its CGM systems and others involved in the diabetes care continuum. In this regard, Leach pointed to My Dexcom Account, the company's recently launched digital support system.\nLeach also highlighted Dexcom’s early launch access of Smart Basal, set for this month, stating: “Smart Basal has the potential to become the new standard for any person managing type 2 diabetes with basal insulin.\n“We believe this personalised dosing module can lead to more accurate basal insulin titration, accelerate the time to reach optimal dose, significantly simplify workflows for the prescriber and, most importantly, improve outcomes for those using our products.”\n\nAs previously mentioned during his presentation at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, Leach also discussed Dexcom’s ambition to drive growth in its international markets by raising awareness and expanding CGM access.\nAccording to a GlobalData market model, Dexcom, which is headquartered in the US, held the second largest CGM market share in the US in 2025 at 44.7%, trailing Abbott in pole position with a 48.5% share. Meanwhile, in territories including Europe, the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and the Middle East & Africa (MEA), Dexcom’s market share is dwarfed by leader Abbott.\n\nStory continues\nAccording to a GlobalData market model, the CGM market is growing at a CAGR of 9.85% and projected to reach a valuation of $15.69bn in 2035.\nIn a summary statement on Dexcom’s financial results, Leach said: \"2025 was another great year for Dexcom as we significantly expanded access to Dexcom CGM and launched our Dexcom G7 15 Day system. We look forward to building on this momentum in 2026.\"\n\n\"Dexcom reports 2025 revenues of $4.66bn yet 2026 outlook lags analyst expectations\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nSEGG Media Unlocks $20M+ in Annual Revenue by Finalizing Terms to Secure Controlling Interest in Veloce Media Group\n\nSEGG Media Corporation\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:10 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SEGG\n\nTransaction Closing Date Set for Next Tuesday, February 17\nFORT WORTH, Texas, Feb. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sports Entertainment Gaming Global Corporation (NASDAQ: SEGG, LTRYW) (the “Company” or “SEGG Media”), the global sports, entertainment, and gaming group, today announced that it has agreed to binding terms to acquire at least a majority interest in Veloce Media Group (\"Veloce\"), one of the fastest-growing and market leading platforms operating at the intersection of sport, gaming and digital media.\n\nThe completion date for consummating the acquisition is set for Tuesday, February 17, 2026, which will result in SEGG Media acquiring a controlling interest of Veloce, enabling consolidation for accounting and reporting purposes and direct control. The transaction values Veloce at approximately $61 million (£45 million) and is projected to contribute in excess of $20 million in additional annual revenue which will begin to be reported in the first quarter of 2026. SEGG Media's management views Veloce as a foundational international platform that aligns with the Company’s strategy of acquiring cash-generative, media-driven sports assets capable of scaling across sponsorship, content, and commerce.\n\nThe acquisition of Veloce will be completed through a blend of cash consideration and SEGG Media common shares priced at $10 per share. The Veloce acquisition is one that the Company has been hyper-focused on for months and completing the transaction is a paradigm shift for SEGG Media and its shareholders. The targeted acquisition of Veloce by SEGG Media signals the Company's rapid evolution into a diversified global sports and media group.\nVeloce's recent acquisition of Quadrant, co-founded by the current Formula 1 Champion Lando Norris, is a significant and rapidly growing gaming and lifestyle company. With a portfolio of blue-chip commercial partners and direct revenue generation in apparel and product sales the Quadrant business will continue to play a key role in the revenue growth of Veloce and SEGG Media.\n\nDarryl Eales, Veloce Director and investor and formerly CEO of Lloyd’s Development Capital, commented: “I’m truly excited by the potential of the Veloce and SEGG partnership. High-quality, driven, and aligned management teams are crucial for the delivery of strong shareholder value creation. The combined leadership creates a powerful platform for significant and rapid growth, underpinned by both SEGG’s exciting brands and well-founded sports and entertainment strategy and Veloce’s multi-stream revenue platform and strong financial performance.\n\nStory Continues\n“Both the Veloce team and the SEGG Board have remained relentless in executing the transaction - even as SEGG completed the final stages of its turnaround - driven by a combined belief in the significant scale of the opportunity that exists post-completion. With the combined value of Veloce, SEGG, and additional pipeline acquisitions, receiving consideration in $10 SEGG stock represents significant upside for Veloce shareholders.”\n\nDaniel Bailey, CEO of Veloce Media Group, said: “This acquisition represents a defining moment not only for Veloce, but for SEGG Media as a group. From the outset, it was clear that our businesses share a common vision for building a global, digitally led sports media platform with ambition and long-term commercial strength.\n“The combination of SEGG Media’s access to public markets and strategic focus with Veloce’s brands, partnerships and proven revenue model creates a powerful foundation for accelerated expansion.”\nVeloce’s ecosystem spans championship-winning esports teams, athlete-led content platforms, sustainable motorsport series, and a commercial portfolio supported by global brands including McLaren, Revolut, VISA, LEGO, Microsoft, Hilton, E.ON, and Thrustmaster.\n\nDriving over 500 million views per month, Veloce brings with it rapidly growing and diversified revenue streams across digital content, esports, motorsport and brand partnerships, reporting $17.5 million (£12.8 million) in revenue for its latest reported financial period.\n\nSince the start of 2026, SEGG Media’s strategy has been firmly focused on executing fundamental acquisitions designed to accelerate its growth by establishing a scalable and profitable revenue-generating platform. The integration of Veloce’s business and revenue positions SEGG Media to capitalize on accelerating global demand across sport, media, gaming and digital entertainment, with a clear focus on creating genuine value to the Company driven by consistently improving return on invested capital (ROIC) and sustaining high-quality revenue growth with higher profit margins.\nRobert Stubblefield, CFO and Interim CEO and President of SEGG Media, said: “The acquisition of Veloce Media Group is a pivotal acquisition for the Company and a clear validation of the strategic direction we set at the start of 2026. Veloce delivers scale, rapidly growing revenues and high-quality commercial partnerships that materially strengthen our profile.\n\n“This acquisition of Veloce and its subsidiary Quadrant springboards SEGG Media to immediately unlocking significant revenue for the Company, which creates long-term shareholder value especially as we integrate a best-in-class digital sports and media platform into the Company. Simply put, it’s a gamechanger!”\nClosing is subject to final legal review, completion of definitive documentation, and customary closing conditions.\nAbout SEGG Media Corporation\nSEGG Media (Nasdaq: SEGG, LTRYW) is a global sports, entertainment and gaming group operating a portfolio of digital assets including Sports.com, Concerts.com and Lottery.com.

      "Content": "As Billionaire Bill Ackman Calls Meta Platforms Cheap, Should You Buy META Stock?\n\nSubhasree Kar\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman recently turned heads on Wall Street by disclosing a significant new stake in Meta Platforms (META), signaling his belief that the tech giant’s stock is undervalued despite ongoing volatility. Through his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Ackman allocated a major new stake in Meta Platforms, now representing about 10% of the fund's capital as of the end of 2025.\n\nIn its annual investor presentation, Pershing said that Meta’s current share price significantly undervalues its long-term artificial intelligence (AI) driven growth potential, arguing that investor concerns over heavy AI spending are overstated. META shares have declined amid fears about substantial AI-related capital expenditures for 2026, but Pershing noted that the stock’s valuation is lower than peers like Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) , and Nvidia (NVDA) .\nMore News from Barchart 1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nWhile META stock has faced pressure amid concerns over high AI-related spending and short-term execution risk, Ackman’s bold move fuels the debate over whether Meta Platforms' current valuation offers a compelling entry point.\n\nAbout Meta Stock Meta Platforms is a technology conglomerate headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and best known for owning and operating some of the world’s most influential social media and communication platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Threads. Originally founded as Facebook in 2004, the company rebranded to Meta in 2021 to reflect its strategic pivot toward immersive technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and the metaverse.\nIn addition to its flagship apps, Meta develops hardware and AI-driven products through divisions like Reality Labs, spanning VR headsets and smart glasses. Meta’s market capitalization stands at $1.64 trillion, ranking it among the largest technology companies globally.\n\nMeta’s share price has shown a modest recovery this year after a period of volatility. Year-to-date (YTD), META stock is down about 2%, slightly underperforming the broader market, reflecting a stabilizing trend after investors digested mixed earnings and heavy AI spending projections.\nOver a longer 12-month horizon, the stock has declined 11%, lagging the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 12% gains over the same period. That decline comes amid fears about the company's projected $115 billion to $135 billion in AI-related capital expenditures for 2026. META stock is currently trading 18% below its 52-week high of $796.25, which was reached back in August 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, looking back over longer horizons, META has delivered significant multi-year gains, delivering 276% returns over the past three years as the company has expanded its dominance in digital advertising and invested in next-generation technologies.\nMETA stock currently trades at a premium compared to the sector median but below its own historical average at 22.5 times forward earnings.\nStable Topline Growth Meta Platforms’ fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results, released on Jan. 28, reflected continued topline strength alongside intensifying investment in AI and infrastructure.\nFor Q4 2025, Meta reported revenue of $59.9 billion, up 24 % year-over-year (YOY), driven by robust advertising demand across its Family of Apps. Net income for the quarter rose 9% from the prior-year quarter to $22.8 billion, while EPS increased 11% to $8.88 compared with $8.02 in Q4 2024, exceeding analyst expectations. Total operating margins for the quarter were about 41%, compressed versus Q4 2024 as costs climbed with higher infrastructure and investments.\n\nOn a full-year basis, Meta’s 2025 revenue reached $201 billion, up 22% YOY from $164.5 billion, underscoring sustained demand. However, full-year net income was $60.5 billion, modestly below the prior year’s $62.4 billion, while EPS came in at $23.49, a decline of about 2% from $23.86 in 2024, reflecting the impact of significantly higher expenses tied to scaling AI infrastructure and other strategic initiatives.\nIn tandem with these results, management provided 2026 guidance that emphasized continued growth and heavy investment in AI capabilities. For Q1 2026, Meta guided for revenue of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion.\nFor the full year, the company anticipates total expenses between $162 billion and $169 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to come in at $115 billion to $135 billion, a substantial increase, aimed at building out data centers, custom hardware and AI-related infrastructure.\n\nDespite the elevated expense base, Meta reiterated its expectation that operating income in 2026 will exceed 2025 levels, underscoring management’s confidence in long-term profitability even as it invests heavily in future growth engines.\nAnalysts predict EPS to be around $29.67 for fiscal 2026, down slightly YOY, before surging by 14% annually to $33.79 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Meta Stock? Recently, Citizens reaffirmed its “Market Outperform” rating on Meta Platforms with a $900 price target, pointing to accelerating engagement trends on Instagram as a key growth driver.\nFreedom Capital Markets also raised its price target on Meta Platforms to $825 from $800 while reiterating a “Buy” rating following the company’s strong Q4 results. The firm noted that Meta exceeded consensus estimates across key metrics, supported by robust holiday-season ad demand and AI-driven improvements in advertising efficiency.\n\nWall Street is majorly bullish on META stock. Overall, META has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 56 analysts covering the stock, 46 advise a “Strong Buy,” three suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining seven analysts offer a “Hold” rating.\nThe average analyst price target for META is $862.35, indicating potential upside of 33%. The Street-high target price of $1,144 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 76% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Subhasree Kar did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

If you label ​it... it can actually be a trade barrier,” ​Ericsson CEO Börje Ekholm told Reuters. “There ​are no countries on this planet that alone can be fully ‌sovereign.”\nCompanies joining the alliance will self-attest ​to adhering to the ​principles, Smith said, adding that the principles also include provisions for independent assessments.\nAlliance members operate across connectivity, cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software, and artificial intelligence .\n“We will know ​we are successful if ‌the current trend of countries pulling apart on technology issues finds a ​counterweight in what we’re doing,” Smith said.\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, ​Editing by Adam Jourdan and Barbara Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Amazon-Heavy ETFs to Buy on the Dip\n\nTodd Shriber, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nShares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are mired in a slump, which was exacerbated when the company told investors last week that it plans $200 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) investments this year. That revelation stoked a significant intraday plunge in the stock on Feb. 6; and for the month ended Feb. 10, Amazon shares are off 16.5%. That's not far off the 20% decline that defines a bear market .\n\nCompounding those woes are concerns about how the company will pay for that AI spending, including talk that those expenditures could push it into cash-flow-negative territory.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nMaking matters still worse is Amazon's longer-range performance. For the five years ended Feb. 10, the stock is up just 25.3%. That's not a loss, but it feels like one when measured against the much bigger returns of the Nasdaq-100 and the S&P 500 .\nOn the other hand, investors should be careful before penning obituaries on this stock. AI could be a catalyst for Amazon Web Services (AWS) . The company's advertising business grew 22% year over year in the fourth quarter and is seen by some market observers as an underappreciated growth driver.\n\nThe point is, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the company will rebound. Investors who don't want to make an all-in bet on the stock but want some exposure to that resurgence might consider the following exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nA cost-effective Amazon proxy Nearly 480 ETFs feature Amazon among their top 15 holdings, and just five have larger allocations to the stock than does the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEMKT: VCR) . This fund allocates 21.2% to the company, making it a valid proxy for the stock. Actually, it's a two-horse show because Tesla accounts for another 18.1% of its roster.\nFor investors who want exposure to both stocks without having to choose between them, this Vanguard ETF makes a lot of sense. It's also practical for buy-and-hold market participants because its annual expense ratio is just 0.09%, or $9 on a $10,000 investment. That's well below the category average of 0.76%.\n\nA pure retail play For all the talk about advertising, AI, and AWS, Amazon remains the dominant name in online retail and one of the largest retailers of any stripe. So it's not surprising that the VanEck Retail ETF 's (NASDAQ: RTH) 17.2% Amazon weight is exceeded by only a small number of ETFs.\n\nStory Continues\nThe VanEck fund is slightly less concentrated at the top than the aforementioned Vanguard ETF, as three stocks account for about 39% of the portfolio: Amazon, Walmart , and Costco Wholesale .\nBut despite the hefty weight to Amazon, this VanEck fund isn't a dedicated consumer discretionary ETF. Stocks from that sector represent 53.9% of the portfolio, while consumer staples businesses account for 29%. Healthcare and industrial stocks make up more than 17% of this retail ETF, but it's still a strong way -- if not a unique one -- to position for an Amazon rebound.\n\nOne for the risk takers Remember the post-earnings drubbing Amazon endured last week? The Direxion Daily AMZN Bull 2x Shares ETF (NASDAQ: AMZU) really got the bad end of that deal because, as its name implies, it attempts to deliver 200% of Amazon's daily performance. So when markets don't like what the company has to say, this fund is going to be punished .\nThat's also a reminder that when Amazon shares are rallying, this ETF's gains will be amplified, but only over short holding periods, such as a day or a few days.\n\nThat disclaimer is crucial because, unlike the other ETFs mentioned here or Amazon itself, the Direxion fund is NOT suitable for buy-and-hold investors -- no leveraged ETF is. Traders with a gambler's spirit and a high risk tolerance can use this fund around events such as earnings releases, new product announcements, and the like -- but that's all.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor , and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\nSee the 10 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 13, 2026.\nTodd Shriber has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

As fears build in the US that new AI models could undermine software, legal and real estate service providers, capital appears to be rotating toward the region's hardware champions. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has advanced more than 12% in 2026, while the S&P 500 ( SPY ) is down 0.2% and the Nasdaq ( NASDAQ:QQQ ) 100 has slipped around 2%. Over the past 10 sessions alone, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen 4.6%, wiping out roughly $1.5 trillion in market value, underscoring how sharply sentiment has shifted away from perceived AI losers.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with BOM:539807.\nIs SPY fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nInvestors increasingly seem to be favoring upstream beneficiaries of AI infrastructure spending, where revenue streams could prove more resilient regardless of which applications ultimately dominate. Surging memory chip prices have supported regional heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ), which recorded its largest overseas buying session on Thursday, sending shares up 6.4%, followed by additional gains on Friday. In Japan, Kioxia Holdings surged 15% after issuing a better-than-anticipated outlook tied to strong AI demand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ( NYSE:TSM ) continues to anchor flows into Taiwanese equities, with global investors posting their third-largest weekly purchase in a holiday-shortened week. Market participants have also cited Micron Technology's ( NASDAQ:MU ) comments on memory supply tightness and Nvidia's remarks on sustainable spending as reinforcing the case that upstream suppliers may continue collecting revenue even as end-market uncertainty persists.\n\nMarket structure is amplifying the divergence. TSMC now accounts for nearly 45% of Taiwan's Taiex index, roughly triple its weighting a decade ago, while Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix ( HXSCL ) together represent close to 40% of South Korea's Kospi. At the same time, parts of Asia seen as less exposed to AI disruption have held firm, with Japan's Topix insurance sub-index rising 6.2% since Feb. 3 and its real estate counterpart gaining 15%. The rolling weekly correlation between Asian and US equities has slipped to 0.43, the weakest level since June 2022, suggesting regional differentiation could be deepening. Although software names such as Kingdee International Software Group and India's Infosys declined alongside US peers, many investors argue Asian markets could continue to outperform, supported by their role as AI enablers, relatively cheaper valuations and stronger earnings growth dynamics.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ALAB Stock Dips 31% Post Q4 Earnings: Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nNilanshi Mukherjee\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:51 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ALAB\n\nAstera Labs ALAB shares have plunged 30.8% since it reported fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday. The decline was due to a slight decrease in non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2025, which dropped 70 basis points sequentially to 75.7% compared to the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base. It benefits from strong demand for its PCIe solutions, which have also been a major growth driver.\n\nALAB Stock's Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nALAB Benefits From Expanding Portfolio Astera Labs’ product portfolio, including Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus, has been a key catalyst. In the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB started increasing production of its Scorpio X-Series lead platform.\n\nThe company also expanded the Smart Fabric Switch roadmap with hyperscaler partners, adding new features to meet the needs of next-generation scale-up networking. Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nALAB Offers Strong Q1 Guidance Aster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. Price and Consensus Astera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc. Quote\nALAB Faces Stiff Competition Despite an expanding portfolio and strong partner base, ALAB is facing stiff competition from other industry players like Marvell Technology MRVL, Credo Technology CRDO, and Broadcom AVGO in the connectivity space.\n\nMarvell Technology is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. Marvell Technology recently completed its acquisition of Celestial AI, strengthening its scale-up optical connectivity capabilities for large-scale AI deployments.\n\nCredo Technology is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market with a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. Credo Technology’s shares have rallied 3.8% in the trailing six-month period.\n\nBroadcom is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market by developing advanced solutions that enhance signal quality and extend the reach of PCIe connections in high-speed data environments. Broadcom shares have surged 50.3% in the trailing 12-month period.\n\nALAB Shares Trading at a Premium Astera Labs’ stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 17.67X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.51X.\nALAB's Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion Astera Labs’ strong fundamentals, expanding partnerships, and rising AI demand reinforce its leadership in connectivity solutions. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition remain a headwind. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\n\nAstera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

That added to persistent concerns the iPhone maker’s AI capabilities lag its peers.\n\nThe shares slipped again early Friday, recently falling nearly 1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here .\nWhy This Is Important Tech stocks have been the driving force behind a stock market rally that began with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Because of tech's weight in stock indexes, recent headwinds for the sector, including concerns about AI spending and stretched valuations, have been a drag on the broader market.\nApple and its Magnificent Seven peers are having a rough 2026, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ( MAGS ) in the red and underperforming the S&P 500 so far this year.\nShares of hyperscalers Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Meta ( META ) have been weighed down by concerns that they are overspending on AI infrastructure . Their massive data center spending has historically been a boon to chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ), but even that stock is treading water amid anxiety about tech sector valuations.\n\nBefore this week’s setbacks, Apple stock appeared to have turned a corner. Apple announced in mid-January that it had selected Alphabet’s ( GOOG ) Gemini to power its future AI features, including the updated Siri features that are reportedly delayed. Weeks later, Apple reported record results for the all-important holiday quarter, when iPhone and services revenue easily beat estimates.\nApple shares rose nearly 8% in the week following that earnings report, lifting the stock into the green for the year.

      "Content": "These 3 Zacks 'Strong Buy' Stocks Reflect the Hottest S&P 500 Stocks of 2026\n\nDerek Lewis\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nThough it may not feel like it amid recent concerns surrounding technology, particularly in software and some other stocks tied to the broader AI frenzy, many in the trade are still crushing it in the new year, delivering big-time gains.\nAnd concerning the all-star performers, three stocks that sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER reflect the top three hottest S&P 500 stocks in 2026. What’s been driving the positivity?\n\nSanDisk Soars SanDisk shares have been melting higher in 2026 months as its role in the broader AI frenzy finally comes into focus. The stock is up more than 160% in the new year alone, by far reflecting one of the strongest moves we’ve seen.\nBelow is a chart illustrating SNDK’s performance in 2026 relative to the broader Zacks Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAI is driving a huge surge in storage demand, which is where SanDisk comes in. NAND prices are rising rapidly, with AI data centers, cloud providers, and edge devices all needing more high-speed storage.\nThe company’s revenue acceleration is evident in recent quarterly releases, with sales of $3.0 billion climbing 61% year-over-year throughout its latest period. Its current fiscal year (ends in June) has also confirmed the favorable demand backdrop, with the current $14.1 billion estimate up a staggering 50% over the last year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCan Western Digital Repeat as the Best? WDC shares impressively reflected one of 2025’s top-performing S&P 500 stocks as well, with the fresh year already looking bright again. Western Digital provides scalable, sustainable technology for hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers, providing cutting-edge innovation that’s expected to drive the next generation of AI-driven data workloads.\nUp nearly 70%, the stock has been red-hot in the fresh year, underpinned by favorable quarterly results that have revealed a massive opportunity for the company.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company’s cash-generating abilities have seen a nice boost thanks to the environment, with free cash flow of $653 million throughout its latest period up by a triple-digit 125%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt’s critical to note that Western Digital also holds roughly a 20% stake in SNDK.\nTeradyne Sales Melt Higher Teradyne manufactures equipment used by other companies to test chips. Unsurprisingly, the fastest-growing segment here is chips for AI data centers and accelerators, and more complex chips mean greater test demand, with AI chips among the most complex right now.\n\nStory Continues\nUp 60%, the stock has enjoyed a great year so far, particularly so relative to the Zacks Technology sector, which is essentially flat YTD.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTeradyne’s sales growth has been incredible over recent periods, as shown below. Recent quarterly results came in above the high-end of previous guidance, further explaining the positivity behind shares in the new year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nWhile pockets of the broader Technology sector, particularly software, continue to get hammered in 2026, all three above – SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER – haven’t seen hardly any negativity, with all three benefiting in a huge way either directly or indirectly from the AI demand environment.\nNotably, all three stocks sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company was perhaps the stock market story of 2025 when it broke past the $5 trillion valuation mark late last year.\nThe company controls about 92% of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market as of the end of 2025. Its closest rivals, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel , hold single digit shares of that market.\nAll of Wall Street watches with bated breath every time Nvidia releases earnings and it's still growing at an explosive rate. As of the its latest report (Q3 2025), the company's quarterly revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion and its diluted earnings per share (EPS) shot up 67%.\n\nNvidia has built a tech hardware empire that is so fundamentally strong that it would be worth a look if the broader market drags it down to discount prices.\n2. The world's general store Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is another company I'm sure you've heard of. And even though it slightly missed earnings expectations for Q4 2025, all that did was create a mini buying opportunity.\nAnd if a market crash drags Amazon's shares down, I would give it a serious look because it's still growing far faster than a company of its size has any right to.\nFor Q4 2025, Amazon saw its sales increase 14% and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales in particular achieved 24% growth. For the whole of 2025, its net sales grew 12% and AWS sales grew 20%. The company's operating income for 2025 also hit $80 billion, up 16% over 2024. Operating cash flow for the year surge 20% over 2024.\n\nWhat's more, the company achieved a 10.8% net income margin for 2025 so it ought to remain profitable despite plans to increase spending dramatically to grow its data center capacity. However, seeing as AWS is Amazon's fastest growing revenue stream I would bet on that investment paying off.\n\nStory Continues\n3. The total tech titan Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is another giant of a company with immensely strong fundamentals that's growing at a much more rapid pace than a company of its size normally would. If a market crash drags Alphabet down, you ought to give it a look.\nAlphabet is a leader in both artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Its Gemini AI program is gaining market share rapidly and it likely to overtake ChatGPT this year. And its tensor processing unit (TPU) is shaping up to be a competitor to Nvidia's GPU.\n\nOn top of that, aside from increased capital expenditures to build out data centers like Amazon, Alphabet's 2025 results were great. Consolidated revenues were up 15% over 2024, the company managed a 32% operating margin, and its diluted EPS surged 34%.\nIf a market downturn brings Alphabet's shares down artificially, give it a look.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Logistics stock selloff Thursday brings assurances of calm\n\nJohn Kingston\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:17 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CHRW\n\nC.H. Robinson did two unusual things Thursday.\nFirst, its high-flying stock, driven in part by investor enthusiasm over the 3PL’s embrace of AI, was one of the logistics companies that fell the hardest that day in a sea of red arrows that sucked in trucking firms as well. C.H. Robinson stock was down 14.54% on the day.\n\n(For perspective, C.H. Robinson hit its 52-week high on February 6 at $203.34. Its 52-week low was April 9 at $84.68. It closed Thursday at $179.48.)\nThe second unusual thing it did was talk about it…sort of.\nCompanies across the spectrum are generally reluctant to say anything publicly about why their stock is doing well or doing poorly. There are plenty of regulations on “forward looking statements” that company managements strive to ensure they are in compliance.\nThe statement released by C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) did not specifically address the size of the stock price decline. But it defended its use of AI and looked to the future, saying the company believes continued adoption of AI “will only continue to strengthen our performance and widen our competitive moat.”\n\nBut in what could be seen as a subtle boost to the owners of its stock, the C.H. Robinson statement said “we remain confident in our strategy and continue to execute on our disciplined share repurchases from the past year.”\nThe enormous selloff also hit two other publicly-traded 3PL companies RXO (NYSE: RXO) , whose stock already had been falling for a year unlike C.H. Robinson, fell more than C.H. Robinson, down 20.45%. Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) declined 15.6%.\nExpeditors International (NYSE: EXPD) fell a whopping 13.18%. While it is not an over the road freight broker like RXO or C.H. Robinson, its business is an asset-light company that works to get freight from shipper/manufacturer to an end customer via an ocean or air carrier on assets owned by others.\n\nAlthough the selloff across markets appeared to be directed at companies whose business can be even further disrupted by AI than what was expected already, both logistics and trucking companies felt the sting of the decline.\nAmong the trucking companies whose stocks took a big hit Thursday, TFI International (NYSE: TFII) was down 8.11%; Forward Air (NASDAQ: FWRD) fell 8.75%; Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ: WERN) declined 5.34%; Heartland Express (NASDAQ: HTLD) fell 5.75%.\nAmong the bigger trucking companies, Old Dominion (NASDAQ: ODFL) fell 4.6%, J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) declined 5.06% and Knight Swift (NYSE: KNX) declined just 0.6%.\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.57% for the day.\nJust before 11 a.m. Friday, some of those stocks had rebounded but only a fraction of the prior day’s decline. C.H. Robinson was up 3.42%; RXO was up 2.77%; and Landstar rose 0.81%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transportation research team at Baird Equity Research sought to figure out a reason for the decline in a published note.\n“The transport complex has come under meaningful pressure this morning for reasons that are not immediately identifiable,” the company said in its research note. “That said, we would note that the weakness appears to be concentrated in the asset-light, technology-enabled brokerage platforms, both in domestic truck brokerage and international freight forwarding.”\n\nIt cited four possible causes for the selloff.\nThe most important, Baird said, was “emerging debate around open-source automation agents such as Molt Bot that offer increased potential to automate routine back-office tasks and help equalize the technology playing field for smaller operators.” The size advantage of companies like C.H. Robinson would presumably shrink if that were to occur.\n“Spot rates likely peaking following winter storm Fern and the bomb cyclone before the receipt of tax rebate checks that are expected to be meaningfully higher year-on-year.\nThe Self-Drive Act, which could speed autonomous trucking.\nAnd a reason that might seem counterintuitive: the FMCSA final rule on non-domiciled CDL holders. Some interpretations of the law have concluded that it will not reduce capacity as quickly as might have been expected.\n\nBaird’s note was primarily to express skepticism as it reiterated its Outperform rating on several stocks.\n“Automation is not a new theme,” Baird said. “The digital brokers automated in the 2010-2015 period, but service dependability was lacking as was their ability to leverage high execution predictive analytics. Successful execution in digital brokerage requires a best in class data set, built over years across cycles. Only the large tech-enabled players like CHRW and EXPD possess that breadth and depth of shipment, pricing, and carrier performance data to deliver. Security is also a growing focus.”\nA similar research note from the transportation research team at Barclays reiterated its Overweight rating on C.H. Robinson in addressing the causes for the selloff.\nIts note linked to a tweet from the co-founder at Open Mercato regarding a freight management system built on Open Mercato. Barclays said it believed the promise inherent in this tweet from Tomasz Karwatka was a key driver in the decline in transportation stocks, particularly the 3PLs.\n\nBarclays also suggested a press release from Algorhythm Holdings (NASDAQ: RIME) that its SemiCab platform “in live customer deployments” was able to “scale freight volumes by 300% to 400% without a corresponding increase in operational headcount” was a factor in the selloff.\nAlgorhythm released a white paper on its findings in conjunction with the press release. (A link to the white paper was not functional early Friday).\n\nBut Barclays said the key disruptor in transportation logistics remains C.H. Robinson.\n“We see the moves in asset-light transportation stocks as disproportionate to the risk and would be significant buyers of weakness, especially in CHRW shares,” it said.\nC.H. Robinson’s statement repeated many of its own boasts about where it stands in the cycle of AI adoption. It wrapped up its defense by alluding to its financial position without mentioning the stock price.\n“Our leadership in AI enhances the already strong fundamentals of our company,” C.H. Robinson said. “We have outperformed the freight market for eight consecutive quarters. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and investment-grade credit rating allow us to continually invest in innovation, even when competitors can’t, while also buying back our stock. We are a dividend aristocrat, returning higher dividends to our investors for 27 consecutive years.”\nThe post Logistics stock selloff Thursday brings assurances of calm appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

C.H. Robinson stock was down 14.54% on the day.\n\n(For perspective, C.H. Robinson hit its 52-week high on February 6 at $203.34. Its 52-week low was April 9 at $84.68. It closed Thursday at $179.48.)\nThe second unusual thing it did was talk about it…sort of.\nCompanies across the spectrum are generally reluctant to say anything publicly about why their stock is doing well or doing poorly. There are plenty of regulations on “forward looking statements” that company managements strive to ensure they are in compliance.\nThe statement released by C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) did not specifically address the size of the stock price decline. But it defended its use of AI and looked to the future, saying the company believes continued adoption of AI “will only continue to strengthen our performance and widen our competitive moat.”\n\nBut in what could be seen as a subtle boost to the owners of its stock, the C.H. Robinson statement said “we remain confident in our strategy and continue to execute on our disciplined share repurchases from the past year.”\nThe enormous selloff also hit two other publicly-traded 3PL companies RXO (NYSE: RXO) , whose stock already had been falling for a year unlike C.H. Robinson, fell more than C.H. Robinson, down 20.45%. Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) declined 15.6%.\nExpeditors International (NYSE: EXPD) fell a whopping 13.18%. While it is not an over the road freight broker like RXO or C.H. Robinson, its business is an asset-light company that works to get freight from shipper/manufacturer to an end customer via an ocean or air carrier on assets owned by others.\n\nAlthough the selloff across markets appeared to be directed at companies whose business can be even further disrupted by AI than what was expected already, both logistics and trucking companies felt the sting of the decline.\nAmong the trucking companies whose stocks took a big hit Thursday, TFI International (NYSE: TFII) was down 8.11%; Forward Air (NASDAQ: FWRD) fell 8.75%; Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ: WERN) declined 5.34%; Heartland Express (NASDAQ: HTLD) fell 5.75%.\nAmong the bigger trucking companies, Old Dominion (NASDAQ: ODFL) fell 4.6%, J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) declined 5.06% and Knight Swift (NYSE: KNX) declined just 0.6%.\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.57% for the day.\nJust before 11 a.m. Friday, some of those stocks had rebounded but only a fraction of the prior day’s decline. C.H. Robinson was up 3.42%; RXO was up 2.77%; and Landstar rose 0.81%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transportation research team at Baird Equity Research sought to figure out a reason for the decline in a published note.\n“The transport complex has come under meaningful pressure this morning for reasons that are not immediately identifiable,” the company said in its research note. “That said, we would note that the weakness appears to be concentrated in the asset-light, technology-enabled brokerage platforms, both in domestic truck brokerage and international freight forwarding.”\n\nIt cited four possible causes for the selloff.\nThe most important, Baird said, was “emerging debate around open-source automation agents such as Molt Bot that offer increased potential to automate routine back-office tasks and help equalize the technology playing field for smaller operators.” The size advantage of companies like C.H. Robinson would presumably shrink if that were to occur.\n“Spot rates likely peaking following winter storm Fern and the bomb cyclone before the receipt of tax rebate checks that are expected to be meaningfully higher year-on-year.\nThe Self-Drive Act, which could speed autonomous trucking.\nAnd a reason that might seem counterintuitive: the FMCSA final rule on non-domiciled CDL holders. Some interpretations of the law have concluded that it will not reduce capacity as quickly as might have been expected.\n\nBaird’s note was primarily to express skepticism as it reiterated its Outperform rating on several stocks.\n“Automation is not a new theme,” Baird said. “The digital brokers automated in the 2010-2015 period, but service dependability was lacking as was their ability to leverage high execution predictive analytics. Successful execution in digital brokerage requires a best in class data set, built over years across cycles. Only the large tech-enabled players like CHRW and EXPD possess that breadth and depth of shipment, pricing, and carrier performance data to deliver. Security is also a growing focus.”\nA similar research note from the transportation research team at Barclays reiterated its Overweight rating on C.H. Robinson in addressing the causes for the selloff.\nIts note linked to a tweet from the co-founder at Open Mercato regarding a freight management system built on Open Mercato. Barclays said it believed the promise inherent in this tweet from Tomasz Karwatka was a key driver in the decline in transportation stocks, particularly the 3PLs.\n\nBarclays also suggested a press release from Algorhythm Holdings (NASDAQ: RIME) that its SemiCab platform “in live customer deployments” was able to “scale freight volumes by 300% to 400% without a corresponding increase in operational headcount” was a factor in the selloff.\nAlgorhythm released a white paper on its findings in conjunction with the press release. (A link to the white paper was not functional early Friday).\n\nBut Barclays said the key disruptor in transportation logistics remains C.H. Robinson.\n“We see the moves in asset-light transportation stocks as disproportionate to the risk and would be significant buyers of weakness, especially in CHRW shares,” it said.\nC.H. Robinson’s statement repeated many of its own boasts about where it stands in the cycle of AI adoption. It wrapped up its defense by alluding to its financial position without mentioning the stock price.\n“Our leadership in AI enhances the already strong fundamentals of our company,” C.H. Robinson said. “We have outperformed the freight market for eight consecutive quarters. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and investment-grade credit rating allow us to continually invest in innovation, even when competitors can’t, while also buying back our stock. We are a dividend aristocrat, returning higher dividends to our investors for 27 consecutive years.”\nThe post Logistics stock selloff Thursday brings assurances of calm appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nGold and silver prices rise No mystery why -- the price of gold is rising. After hitting an all-time high of $5,419.80 per ounce on Jan. 28, gold prices tumbled to almost $4,500 in early February, according to data from TradingEconomics.com. Gold moved back above the $5,000 threshold last week, slipped below it yesterday (which is why SSR's stock price fell), and is back above $5,000 today -- $5,001 per ounce, to be precise.\nThe story on silver is similar. Silver prices peaked on Jan. 28 at $116.58 per ounce. Silver prices fell to $66, then bounced back above $80, only to fall nearly 10% yesterday. At last report, silver is up about 0.9% today, passing $78 and heading toward $79.\n\nIt makes sense that with gold and silver up today, SSR Mining stock is up, too.\nIs SSR Mining stock a buy? Will SSR Mining stock continue to rise? That depends largely on how much it's been able to earn from the rising prices of gold and silver. We'll find that out Tuesday, Feb. 17, when SSR reports Q4 earnings.\nAnalysts predict SSR will earn $0.57 per share -- nearly six times Q4 2024 profit -- with full-year earnings of $1.72. On SSR's $28 stock price, that works out to a 16 price-to-earnings ratio on a stock that -- analysts say -- will more than double earnings every year for the next five years.\n\nSounds like a buy to me.\nShould you buy stock in SSR Mining right now?

Sign in\n\nDonald Trump is planning to scale back some tariffs on steel and aluminium goods as he battles an affordability crisis that has sapped his approval ratings ahead of November’s midterm elections.\nThe US president hit steel and aluminium imports with tariffs of up to 50 per cent last summer, and has expanded the taxes to a range of goods made from those metals including washing machines and ovens.\nBut his administration is now reviewing the list of products affected by the levies and plans to exempt some items, halt the expansion of the lists and instead launch more targeted national security probes into specific goods, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nThe people said trade officials in the commerce department and US trade representative’s office believed the tariffs were hurting consumers by raising prices for goods such as pie tins and food and drink cans.\nTrump’s tariff blitz has pushed US duties to their highest level since before the second world war. But the president has repeatedly walked back some of his stiffest levies amid voter anger at the US’s affordability crisis.\nMore than 70 per cent of US adults rate economic conditions as fair or poor, according to a Pew Research Center poll published this month. About 52 per cent of Americans think Trump’s economic policies have made conditions worse.\nThe administration has already provided carve-outs for popular food products in a bid to tame grocery price inflation for ordinary Americans. It also called a truce in its trade war with China after Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs.\nThe move to soften the steel and aluminium tariffs, which were among the earliest introduced in Trump’s second term, comes as economists say that Americans are paying for the levies , undercutting the president’s claim that foreign companies would bear the burden.\nTrump’s trade war has also brought political backlash, even from some allies.\nOn Wednesday, members of Trump’s own Republican Party joined Democrats as the US House of Representatives voted to overturn Trump’s tariffs on Canada — delivering a major rebuke of his trade war on the US’s second-biggest trading partner. Trump is expected to veto the bill, leaving the levies in place.\nSeveral Republican lawmakers face tough election battles in their home states in November’s midterm elections amid voter anxiety about the impact of tariffs on small businesses and consumers.\nThe latest move on the metals tariffs is also designed to bring clarity to an increasingly complicated lobbying process in Washington that has emerged since Trump imposed the levies.\n\nStory Continues\nThe administration has so far largely allowed US businesses to lobby for products made of steel and aluminium made by rival foreign producers to be hit with tariffs, in a so-called inclusion process.\nThe process has been run by the commerce department, which has mostly approved the requests from domestic companies, which have cited the “national security” risks associated with goods including bicycle parts.\nBut the mechanism has led to a sprawling list of household goods subjected to tariffs of up to 50 per cent on their metal content.\nOfficials felt the tariff regime was “too complicated to enforce”, one person said, and needed to be simplified.\nCountries including the UK, Mexico and Canada as well as EU members could stand to benefit from any easing of the US’s tariffs on goods made of steel and aluminium.\nOne European business leader, who declined to be named, said they knew of a company that had sent four identical containers of machinery to the US and was charged different rates for each one.\nThe commerce department last offered US companies an opportunity to nominate foreign suppliers to be hit with tariffs in October, but blew past its own 60-day deadline to greenlight new levies.\nAs part of that round, American manufacturers of mattresses, cake tins and bicycles all lobbied for extra duties on foreign businesses.\n“Steel is not just a commodity, it is a national security asset,” said Kevin Dempsey, president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute.\n“It is critical that the US government maintain the Section 232 national security steel tariffs, said Dempsey, who added they “are essential to prevent this overcapacity from fuelling new surges of harmful imports into the US market, which would cause a profound threat to American national security and undermine the health of the American steel industry”.\nThe close to 100 filings underscore the broad range of items that companies are now arguing pose a national security risk to the US.\nOne company argues in its filing that “without bread, buns, baguettes, crusty rolls, cakes, muffins and the like”, soldiers in the US military “will not be able to maintain a healthy diet”.\nThe commerce department, the US trade representative’s office and the White House all declined to comment.\nAdditional reporting by Ilya Gridneff\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2023\n© 2023 The Financial Times Ltd.

According to the Financial Times, the president may be narrowing the scope of his steel and aluminum tariffs and our Washington correspondent Ben Worskill is with me now to discuss. You know, this follows the roll back of various sort of specific tariffs that we have been seeing gradually. So what do we know about this potential one and and the effect it could have?\n00:23 Ben Worskill\nYeah, so the you're right that this would be kind of the latest in a in a string of of tariff concessions from Trump, scaling back some of his tariffs in response to these affordability concerns that have emerged as a giant political issue. In terms of this one specifically, the debate here appears to be um amid the administration about scaling back tariffs on specific goods that have steel and aluminum in them. Basically excluding those goods, which would then lower the prices of those goods. This overall would be a really significant pivot for Trump if this goes forward on the signals from the White House are that it's still a debate going on, but it's clearly under consideration here.\n00:58 Ben Worskill\nBecause how important steel and aluminum tariffs have been to the president. Going back all the way to his first term. Remember even in his second term, steel these new tariffs were some of the first ones out of the gate and you see Trump Trump officials often traveling to things like US steel plants to tout these tariffs as as as protecting this industry there.\n01:13 Ben Worskill\nSo far the White House response today has been to kind of downplay these, but acknowledge that there is a debate here. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett was on CNBC, and he described it as a potential clarification on incidental objects. Still don't have a lot of details on what exactly the objects would be there, but the reporting we have is broader than that. These are these are a lot of a lot of goods that could affect a lot of people.\n01:36 Ben Worskill\nUm, in the reporting this morning, washing machines, ovens, pie tins and drink cans were all mentioned as possible possible exclusions here. That lowering prices there would quite literally hit hit folks hit hit hit home for folks in these lower prices as these affordability worries continue this midterm here.\n01:54 Speaker A\nMeanwhile, we're on shutdown watch, right? Right now, it looks like um that Polymarket is is pricing in a 25% chance that there could potentially be a shutdown after Democrats voted to block a motion to advance a House passed bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. So, Ben, what does this what's a partial shutdown and what what is the whole situation here?\n02:22 Ben Worskill\nYeah, we seem very likely to be headed into a shutdown. It's only a few hours away. This this partial shutdown would happen at midnight tonight. Many lawmakers have actually already left Washington. This is the beginning of a recess, somewhere traveling overseas. So it seems very high likelihood that this partial shutdown is in the offing even as negotiations are forward.\n02:44 Ben Worskill\nThis this is a kind of unique one because it's a very, very partial shutdown. There's 12 areas of government funding, 11 of them are done. Those are those aren't going to be impacted this weekend no matter what. It's this 12th one, the Department of Homeland Security, which by one measure is 4% of government funding that is an issue and could be shut down over the weekend.\n03:07 Ben Worskill\nUm this is a this is an an important department, the Department of Homeland Security. It touches a lot of areas including some of interest to the economy and to markets. The TSA is part of a department, FEMA is part of the department, the Coast Guard is part of the department. Um and so those could feel a pinch in the next few days depending on how how whether this shutdown begins and how long it goes out.\n03:29 Ben Worskill\nPerhaps ironically, this whole shutdown is about immigration and about the the um the the administration's role and conduct and immigration over the last few months. Those areas of the department actually aren't expected to be overly affected by a shutdown. Ice, the border patrol, they have separate funding that Republicans passed in the last year. So they they could kind of continue as they are. But this is clearly a back and forth as Democrats try to use this as leverage to get some changes in how the Trump administration approaches immigration.\n03:59 Ben Worskill\nAs for negotiations, they're apparently still going back and forth, the White House and Chuck Schumer, um the Senate minority leader are the main um people negotiating there, but logistically at least to this point, it's very likely we're going to have at least a shutdown begin this weekend depending on um and then the question becomes potentially how long does it go?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Um and so those could feel a pinch in the next few days depending on how how whether this shutdown begins and how long it goes out.\n03:29 Ben Worskill\nPerhaps ironically, this whole shutdown is about immigration and about the the um the the administration's role and conduct and immigration over the last few months. Those areas of the department actually aren't expected to be overly affected by a shutdown. Ice, the border patrol, they have separate funding that Republicans passed in the last year. So they they could kind of continue as they are. But this is clearly a back and forth as Democrats try to use this as leverage to get some changes in how the Trump administration approaches immigration.\n03:59 Ben Worskill\nAs for negotiations, they're apparently still going back and forth, the White House and Chuck Schumer, um the Senate minority leader are the main um people negotiating there, but logistically at least to this point, it's very likely we're going to have at least a shutdown begin this weekend depending on um and then the question becomes potentially how long does it go?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Email pr@fool.com\n\nFull Conference Call Transcript Mark. Philip, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025. Our strong performance this year was driven by positive credit trends, and the benefit of higher interest rates on both persistency and investment income. These results demonstrate the strength of our buy, manage, and distribute operating model in generating high-quality earnings, which has enabled us to take a more strategic approach to capital management. For 2025, we reported net income of $155 million or $1.60 per diluted share. For the full year, we earned $690 million or $6.90 per diluted share while generating a return on average equity of 12%.\n\nAs of December 31, our book value per share was $60.31, an increase of 13% from a year ago. As of December 31, our mortgage insurance in force was $248 billion, a 2% increase versus a year ago. Our twelve-month persistency on December 31 was 86%, with roughly 60% of our in-force portfolio having a note rate of 6% or lower. Over the last several quarters, persistency has been relatively flat reflecting higher mortgage rates and a smaller origination market. As a result, we believe that over the near term, earned premium and insurance in force growth will be modest.\nThe credit quality of our insurance in force remains strong, with a weighted average FICO of 747 and a weighted average original LTV of 93%. Our portfolio default rate increased modestly quarter over quarter reflecting normal seasonality and the continued aging of our insurance in force. Looking forward, we believe that the substantial home equity embedded in our in-force book should mitigate ultimate claims. Outward reinsurance continues to play an integral role in operating our business. At 2025, 98% of our mortgage insurance portfolio was subject to some form of reinsurance. During 2025, we entered into a quota share with a panel of highly rated reinsurers providing forward protection for our 2027 business.\n\nWe remain pleased with the execution of our reinsurance strategy, ceding a meaningful portion of our mezzanine credit risk and diversifying our capital resources. On the Bermuda front, Essent Re continues to be a very effective platform in deploying capital and generating additional earnings for Essent. For 2025, Essent Re earned nearly $80 million in third-party net income while ending the year with $2.3 billion in risk. In addition, during the fourth quarter, Essent Re entered into quota share reinsurance agreements backed by funds at Lloyd’s to reinsure certain property and casualty risks.\n\nStory Continues\nThese agreements are effective in 2026 and we expect $100 million to $150 million written premium with approximately two-thirds to be earned in 2026 at a combined ratio consistent with a diversified P&C reinsurance company. Looking forward, we believe that P&C will be an ongoing opportunity to generate supplemental earnings for Essent Re. On the title front, we remain focused on activations, leveraging our lender network, and building out our transaction management system. However, as a primarily centralized refinance platform, our title operations are unlikely to have a substantial impact on earnings unless there is a material decrease in mortgage rates.\n\nOur consolidated cash and investments as of December 31 totaled $6.6 billion with an aggregate yield for the year of 3.9%. New money yields on our core portfolio in the fourth quarter were nearly 5%, holding largely stable over the past several quarters. We continue to operate from a position of strength with $5.8 billion in GAAP equity, access to $1.3 billion in excess of loss reinsurance, and $1.3 billion in cash and investments at the holding companies. With the full year 2025 operating cash flow of $856 million, our franchise remains well positioned from an earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet perspective.\nWe remain committed to a measured and diversified capital strategy, which enabled us to return nearly $700 million to shareholders in 2025 between dividends and repurchases. During the year, we repurchased nearly 10% of the shares outstanding at 2024. Furthermore, I am pleased that our board has approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share starting in 2026. Now let me turn the call over to David. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.\n\nDavid Weinstock: Let me review our results for the quarter in a little more detail. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.60 per diluted share compared to $1.67 last quarter and $1.58 in the fourth quarter a year ago. Considering Essent Re’s expansion into the Lloyd’s market, as Mark noted, we began to assess the performance of all third-party reinsurance as an operating segment in the fourth quarter.\nMark Casale: To reflect this change,\nDavid Weinstock: GSE and other mortgage risk share is no longer aggregated with U.S. mortgage insurance, and all third-party reinsurance is now disclosed as a separate reportable segment called Reinsurance. All prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the new segment presentation. My comments today are going to focus primarily on our results of our Mortgage Insurance segment. There is additional information on Reinsurance and Corporate and Other results in Exhibits D and E of the financial supplement. Our Mortgage Insurance portfolio ended the fourth quarter with insurance in force of $248.4 billion, a decrease of $452 million from September 30, and an increase of $4.7 billion or 1.9% compared to $243.6 billion at 12/31/2024.\n\nPersistency at 12/31/2025 was 85.7%, compared to 86% at 09/30/2025. Mortgage Insurance net premium earned for the fourth quarter 2025 was $213 million. The average base premium rate for the Mortgage Insurance portfolio for the fourth quarter was 41 basis points, consistent with last quarter, and the average net premium rate was 34 basis points, down one basis point from last quarter. We expect that the average base premium rate for the full year 2026 will be approximately 40 basis points. Our Mortgage Insurance provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses was $55.2 million in 2025, compared to $44.2 million in 2025 and $37.2 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nAt December 31, the default rate on the Mortgage Insurance portfolio was 2.5%, up 21 basis points from 2.29% at 09/30/2025. For the full year 2025, we recorded a net provision on the Mortgage Insurance portfolio of approximately $145 million, with higher defaults reflecting the seasoning of the portfolio. Mortgage Insurance operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $34.3 million and the expense ratio was 16.1%, compared to $31.2 million and 14.4% last quarter. For the full year 2025, operating expenses for the Mortgage Insurance segment totaled $140 million, and we expect that operating expenses for the Mortgage Insurance segment will be approximately $145 million for the full year 2026.\n\nAt December 31, Essent Guaranty’s PMIERs efficiency ratio was strong at 169% with $1.4 billion in excess available assets. Consolidated net investment income and our average balance of cash and investments available for sale in the fourth quarter were largely unchanged from last quarter due to our share repurchase activity. The consolidated effective tax rate for the full year 2025 was 16%, including the impact of $2.1 million of favorable discrete tax items. For 2026, we estimate that the annual effective rate will be approximately 17% excluding the impact of any discrete items. As Mark noted, our total holding company liquidity remains strong and includes $500 million of undrawn revolver capacity under our committed credit facility.\nAt December 31, we had $500 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 8%. In the fourth quarter, Essent Guaranty paid a dividend of $280 million to its U.S. holding company. As of January 1, Essent Guaranty can pay ordinary dividends of $246 million in 2026. At quarter-end, Essent Guaranty’s statutory capital was $3.6 billion with a risk-to-capital ratio of 9.1 to one. Statutory capital includes $2.6 billion contingency reserves at December 31. During the fourth quarter, Essent Re paid a dividend of $100 million to Essent Group. Also in the quarter, Essent Group paid cash dividends totaling $29.5 million to shareholders, and we repurchased 2 million shares for $125 million.\n\nIn January 2026, we repurchased 713,000 shares for $44 million. Now let me turn the call back over to Mark. Thanks, David. In closing, our 2025 results demonstrate Essent’s resilient financial performance in a challenging housing market.\nMark Casale: We delivered a strong return on equity and book value per share growth while retiring nearly\nDavid Weinstock: 10% of our share count through value-accretive repurchases.\nMark Casale: The normalization of credit continues, but our high-quality portfolio remains positioned for a range of economic scenarios as we explore new opportunities. We believe this disciplined strategy serves the best interest of our stakeholders and positions Essent to create long-term shareholder value.\nDavid Weinstock: We will now open for questions. Operator?\n\nOperator: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star and the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, simply press star 1 again. Your first question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just let us start with the decision to enter the Lloyd’s market. I guess, you know, why now? Maybe talk a little bit about the strategy\nMark Casale: That you are doing there, what type of assets you are looking to underwrite, maybe just help us understand what exactly is happening there both strategically and operationally. Thank you.\nMihir Bhatia: Sure. Thanks for the question. I would say it has been in process for a while. We have been studying ways to expand Essent Re. So think of it, Mihir, more Essent Re expansion versus we are jumping into a new line of business. When you take a look at Essent Re, it is a valuable asset. I mean, over the years, it has done the affiliate quota share. They have written a lot of really high-quality GSE risk share business. They have a nice MGA where we assist 10 other\n\nDavid Weinstock: Larger insurance companies to write GSE credit share risk.\nMihir Bhatia: But because of when you combine all three of them, we are sitting there with a $1.7 billion balance sheet, single A rated from AM Best, A- S&P. It is one of the larger reinsurance companies in Bermuda.\nDavid Weinstock: And because of the changes over the past several years, one,\nMihir Bhatia: Just investment yields went up. A lot of asset leverage within P&C. We are on the MI side, we are generally one to one. In P&C, you could be two to one, in some cases, three to one. So there is nice asset leverage. Clearly, that is a lot more valuable when yields go up. Second, S&P a couple years ago now changed their capital\nDavid Weinstock: Capital rules. So there is a lot more\n\nMihir Bhatia: Capital, I would say, efficiencies when writing P&C on top of MI to kind of get that diversity benefit. Right? And third, it is clearly not correlated to the consumer. Those, I would say, attributes probably eighteen months ago is when we started to look at it. So, you know, we have been looking at various ways. And we thought Lloyd’s was a very efficient way for us to kind of step into the market. $50 million of FAL. It is Lloyd’s itself. It is kind of a self-contained market, very, very capital efficient. The $50 million that we are putting in is actually sitting on Essent Re’s balance sheet, so there is no additional capital required.\nI think that is important for folks to realize. And it is really well diversified. So I would say 87% of the business roughly is in insurance versus reinsurance. Our top, you know, 40-plus syndicates that we are backing and reinsuring, and it is generally well diversified across most lines. Less, you know, we kind of made a conscious decision to be a little less weighted towards property cat just because of the volatility there, and that is one where, you know, we still have more, I would say, more work to do. We hired a small team, and they are very experienced in the P&C business, very technical. So they have actuarial backgrounds, which we like.\n\nWe are very technical. Right? We talk a lot about unit economics and balance sheet and all those sort of things. So they kind of fit our style. And we will continue to build that team out. It is not going to be very material, and so I do not want\nMihir Bhatia: To play this up that we have entered into a new business. It is not transformational. It is very measured because that is how we like to do things. And as we learn over time, remember, one of the advantages we have at Essent because we are kind of a founder-operated company, we all own a lot of shares. We have a long-term view. And I was in London a few times last year, and I met most of the syndicates that we are backing within the top 10. And I looked at them and said, you know, do we want to invest with them? Because that is essentially what we are doing.\n\nI know we will recognize it as premiums, but think of it also as kind of almost like a big matching line. So we will certainly update you guys with the leverage, and with that platform, we also have the opportunity to write whole quota share with larger reinsurance companies, kind of like how we do it on the MI side. And the relationships that we have there may be a way for us to partner with some over time. Again, not really in the 2026 forecast. We will see how it goes.\nBut a pretty measured approach, but, you know, similar to title, which is still kind of in that incubation phase and starting to do, you know, we are starting to see some real good signs. They are just nice call options for our investors. So it is not, you know, it is not like we are going to buy back less shares. It is a way for us to learn the business. We will continue to attract talent to the organization both in Bermuda and the U.S., and if there is a time, and we realize where we are in the cycle. We know entering into, you know, kind of it is a little softer\n\nDavid Weinstock: In certain segments of the market. That is fine. You are never going to, we are not trying to time the\nMihir Bhatia: Market. We look at this as an opportunity. Again, longer term, five to ten years, if successful, it will generate supplemental earnings for the company and help us. It is like another tool I have to grow book value per share.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. That is helpful. Thank you. Maybe just switching to the MI business for a second. The\nDavid Weinstock: Right.\nMihir Bhatia: I know you do not manage to market share, so this really is not a\nBose Thomas George: Share question. But, you know, you look at it and you are, I think of those that have reported so far, you are the only\nMark Casale: One that has got NIW lower quarter over quarter. So is that just a reflection of you not liking the returns in the market? Is there a conscious decision to pull back in certain parts of the market or risk grades? Help us understand what is happening there.\n\nMihir Bhatia: Yeah. I would not read too much into it. You know, you have heard me say before, it kind of ebbs and flows. For the year, we were 15. I always say we are kind of the 15, 16. We really try to optimize the unit economics. We have not, you know, I want to say we backed off a couple things earlier in the year. You know, you had the tariffs coming. You know, we probably cut some of the tails, and that is probably a little bit of that. That is okay.\nI mean, you look at, if we went back and if we were two points higher in share for the last three years, it all comes out in a wash. And there is really no price-volume trade, especially the better credits. It is just not there. We would rather take that dollar and give it back to shareholders, and I am telling you, I am warning investors because this is just a price game. And if we are, like, bottom in share and the number one or two guys $5 billion ahead of us in this market, I hear it is price. And we are not, again, everyone has their own strategy.\n\nWe think a dollar, rather than put it into a loan at a super low premium, I will give it back to shareholders. So we are fine. And then, you know, we will weave in times of dislocation like 2020. We wrote the most market share. So, you know, longer term, market share is really a result of some of the things you do. We are very, I would say, when you kind of take a look at us, again, some of the advantages we have. Look at our gross premium yield. It is the highest in the industry, like three points higher than the average.\nIt is pretty high, and run that over a $250 billion, it is pretty meaningful. So those are real economics to the company. Look at our gross, and this will all be available, I guess, when all the Ks come out. But look at our gross operating expenses relative to our peers. Add back the ceding commission. Right? Because everyone looks and talks about net expenses. It is really gross expenses, which is cash going out the door. There is a form of leverage there. We outperform the industry. And so when you think about, and it is a relatively sizable advantage versus a few. That expense efficiency allows us to build a team in Bermuda.\n\nIt allows us to build out title. Those are things, again, since we manage the business so well, these are ways for us to kind of create competitive advantages, clearly on the technology side with EssentEDGE. You know, we have been monetizing AI now for, you know, seven years. We have not done the new AI, but the machine learning and what we are doing and the EDGE is flat out artificial intelligence. But we are monetizing. We are not just talking about it. You can see that in our premium yield. That is another good example of how we are thinking about the business.\nSo, again, back to market share, I would rather have better unit economics at a smaller share than the other way around.\nBose Thomas George: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bose George with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMark Casale: Hey, guys. Good morning. Actually, just a follow-up on that last question.\nBose Thomas George: Your gross premium yield has been 41 basis points for a few quarters. You guided to 40 next year. Is that just kind of a rounding issue or anything tied to market returns?\nMark Casale: It has been, no. It has been 41 for a while, Bose, and just think about it, it actually was lower than that. And I was actually looking at it the other day. It was lower than that in kind of the 2021–2022 period. And remember, if you think about 2022, when I commented how low pricing was, there was kind of a reversal, and pricing kind of came up in the industry and it kind of rolls through, because remember you are talking about insurance in force. So it is tough for, there is not a lot of transparency for analysts and investors on what the premium yield is upfront.\n\nYou can kind of sense though, if you look at kind of where gross premium yields were for all the companies two quarters ago, four quarters ago, that will give you a good hint, a leading indicator as to what people are pricing at on the front end. So I think for us, it actually went up when pricing went up. And clearly pricing, it has been relatively stable. But as that pricing starts to, you know, compress, and it has compressed a little bit in 2025. But the compression is not really competitively oriented, you know, there is a little bit of that, but it is really driven by credit.\nYou know, when we look at the credit that is coming in, like, 757 FICO, you know, we rounded it up, but our LTV in the fourth quarter was shy of 92. So that is, all of a sudden, if you think about the old-fashioned rate card, you are in that one quadrant where it is super good credit quality but lower premium. So that is driving a little bit of it. So I would not get too fussed about it. I mean, once the homeowners that are on the sidelines come back and we get kind of that 740–745, 93 LTV, you will see that pricing come back up. And that will work its way into the yield.\n\nSo it is a way for us to give you guidance to run the models.\nBose Thomas George: Okay. Great. That is helpful. Thanks. And then you noted that insurance in force growth is likely to be modest. I mean, this year was 1.9% year over year, which is already in the modest camp. So is it going to be, do you think it is going to be sort of below that level or kind of in that range?\nMark Casale: I think within that range. Again, I do think longer term, I hate to say longer term, but it is longer term that housing will continue to grow. There will be renewed growth, Bose. I mean, the demographics, you know, 4 to 5 million in that age group, kind of 28 to 32, are coming into that homeownership camp every year. But the lack of, you know, given where rates are, the lack of affordability, a little lack of supply, they are just on the sidelines. And when they come off the sidelines, I do not know. But when they do, it is going to be a bigger spike than people think.\n\nI just, my crystal ball does not work in those types of increments. I think we are well positioned. So, again, from an Essent perspective, credit is relatively benign still. And as long as credit stays benign, and we can continue to produce the type of cash flow we are producing and really just use that to return to shareholders, we are kind of paid to wait, so we are fine with that. So, again, modest growth. Again, that is a little bit of us trying to guide investors and analysts to what they should expect because the numbers are the numbers, and we would rather kind of underpromise and overdeliver than the reverse.\nBose Thomas George: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Again, if you would like to ask a question, press star 1 on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Harter with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBose Thomas George: Thanks, and good morning. Mark, can you talk about what you are seeing in your delinquency activity and whether you are seeing any difference across the vintages, especially the vintages that maybe have a little bit less embedded home price appreciation?\nMark Casale: Yeah. Good question. You know, it is not really. I mean, we have 20,000 defaults. If you break it out by vintage, if you break it out by state, if you break it out by lender, if you break it out by servicer, nothing really stands out. I mean, Florida is a little higher because we had some hurricanes. And I would say that the Florida book is probably our higher premium book, but there is a little bit more risk there. We are fine with that. We love the unit economics in Florida and Texas. But no, it is really, we are always looking for something, but we have not really seen anything.\n\nAnd even the pre-2022 book, and I always like that. We always call it kind of the two books. Right? It is the pre, you know, it goes halfway through 2022 and before is one book and then the newer book, which was at elevated\nPhilip Stefano: HPA,\nMark Casale: And higher interest rates. We are not seeing much of a difference there. That is probably a more normal, high LTV MI type portfolio, and we are not seeing anything there too. I mean, you are going to see noise and we still see it with forbearance, which ultimately is a good answer for borrowers, but it does create some noise in terms of the defaults and the ins and outs. Again, roughly 800,000 loans. There are only 20,200 defaults. I think it was 18,000-plus twelve months ago. So it is really, benign is maybe too light of a word, but we are not really too fussed about where defaults are. It comes down to unemployment, Doug.\n\nI mean, at some point, if it rains, like, every blade of grass is going to get wet. So we keep our eyes on unemployment. That is where we are always looking for pebbles. It will happen. Something will hit us at some point. We are just not seeing it in the, obviously not seeing it. In fact, the credit coming in has never been better. We are not seeing it, and I know you follow a lot of them too. We do not see it in a lot of consumer finance. We are not seeing it in the cards. FHA is pretty elevated.\nBut other than that, we are very, very happy with the portfolio and the performance of the book. And even then, if default rates do spike at some point, look at where our claim rate is. So the embedded home equity helps a lot. I think our claim rate is probably right around 1% ever to date. So, I mean, there are some good protections. And I think it is a little underappreciated by the community, which is fine. I mean, again, if you look at just where we are at book value, it is all cash.\n\nWe do not have a lot of debt, and there is not really a lot of credit given for future value of the cash flows. And do not forget, these future cash flows are pretty well hedged. Right? I mean, we own that first loss piece, but the mezz piece is pretty well hedged out. So we have a high degree of confidence in the present value of those future cash flows. Hence, that is why we are buying back shares. That is why we pay a dividend. And if we did not have that confidence, we certainly would not be funneling cash outside the company.\nDouglas Michael Harter: Great. I appreciate the answer, Mark. Thank you.\nMark Casale: You are welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Weinstock: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So it is interesting. Obviously, I have done this a while and followed a bunch of different companies, and I am thinking about comments from two other founder-run businesses that I recall over time. And one\n\nDouglas Michael Harter: Is in the\nDavid Weinstock: Middle market lending space, and the comment was basically, there is no spread for a bad loan. Conversely, if you are making a massively diversified card-type portfolio, you are ultimately sort of seeking an efficient frontier. You accept the fact that you are going to have losses. They are not idiosyncratic.\nOperator: It strikes me\nDavid Weinstock: That you guys sort of try to balance both. But ultimately, your business is an actuarial business. Mark, you have\nOperator: Sort of\nDavid Weinstock: Provided this cautious outlook. And I am curious\nOperator: If you think it is because you cannot capture price\nDavid Weinstock: In the context of what you are concerned about in terms of credit. Is that the right way to think about this?\n\nMark Casale: Yeah. I mean, I think that is, I do not think you are off. We are never going to be the market leader, and part of this is we do not have to be. You know, our incentives, go look at the incentives, they are all in the proxy statement. Just read the incentives. People do what they are incented to do. I am incented to grow book value per share. One hundred percent of my long-term incentive is growth in book value per share. We are not incented on market share. We are not incented on NIW. We are not incented on insurance in force. So we do not come in every day saying we have to grow NIW.\nLook at the incentives around the industry. Some do. They are going to make different trade-offs. I am not saying we are right and they are wrong. It is just different. People do what they are incented to do. We like, over the long term, to optimize our unit economics. So what yield are we charging, what is our loss, what is our capital? Because over time, if you write good unit economics, that will flow through your P&L. And conversely, if you do not, that will also flow through the P&L. And, again, bottom line is we want to grow book value per share. That is our incentive. That is why we are doing it.\n\nAnd as a founder-run company and owning a lot of shares, and a very, I would say, very supportive and constructive board of directors, a lot of them have been with me from the beginning, we all sing from the same hymn sheet. So it is not like they say you have to grow, they are with us in terms of how we will slowly grow, and I think it is a long-term boring story with Essent. But since we have been public, Richard, we have grown book value per share 18%. Our total stockholder return is close to 12%, which is equal to the S&P 500. It is more than the S&P 400 mid-cap by, like, three points.\nLonger term, am I going to win in the next two weeks, or a month or a quarter?\nDavid Weinstock: I do not know. I do not care.\nMark Casale: I want to win long term, and the company wants to win long term. And I think that is, so when we come in every day, and we do come in every day and we meet and we talk, it is really like where do we want the business to be five years from now, ten years from now. We like to work backwards as to, and when we look at that in the context of do we invest in title, do we invest in Essent Re, do we try to be number one in market share, we balance a lot of that stuff. So, again, it is our way. It is not necessarily the right way.\n\nBut, as a large owner of the company, I feel very comfortable with the direction and how we are managing the company. Got it. That helps. And just to sort of delve in a little bit more, pricing has not really changed that much, but you are a little bit more cautious. Is there something that you are thinking about specifically in terms of housing credit that shifted? And, again, you know our views on the world. So I am curious what your credit outlook is here. It is a good question. I would not, like I said, the market share ebbs and flows. Like I said at the beginning, I would not read too much into it.\nIt is not like we made a credit call and we went to 14% market share. It is nothing like that. It is really around kind of on the margin and optimizing unit economics. You still do a lot of testing and pricing elasticity. Our view is, you know, I think you will know when we are cautious on credit. Trust me, you will know. I would not, it is not a credit call. It is more around what is the best dollar. Is it used to repurchase shares or look at other opportunities, or is it to grow NIW?\n\nAnd I think our view is, given the strength of our balance sheet, given the liquidity advantage we have with Essent Re, we can lean in when things get, you know, when the market looks, you know, when people are a little bit more scared of the market, and we feel like we can get more pricing. Right now, given where pricing is, it really has not moved. We are just comfortable kind of being at the bottom of the pack. It does not really impact. If we were, like I said earlier, larger, it would just require more capital.\nAnd that dollar of capital is probably just better at this point in our life cycle and where the market is, not forever. We think returning it to shareholders is really the best investment decision. And the fact that we retired 10% of the shares, that is a large number. If that continues, I would expect it to continue this year, all else being equal. We bought back $44 million in January. And if we are kind of where we are at in terms of the market, it would not surprise me to see that level continue.\n\nAnd that just means a lot of our larger shareholders get to own more of the company, and they get to own more of a fantastic business. So I think it is a good thing. So do not read into it a credit. It is not really, I am not making a credit call, and I know your views.\nRichard Barry Shane: Appreciate that, and I really do appreciate the answer and the conversation. Thank you, guys.\nDavid Weinstock: You are welcome.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nMark Casale: I would like to thank everyone for calling in and joining the call and the questions, and have a great weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call.

      "Content": "CPI surprise highlights Fed dilemma: cut now or wait?\n\nProactive\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nUS inflation showed further signs of easing in January, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.4% year-over-year, below the 2.5% expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, held steady at 2.5%, its lowest level since March 2021.\nMonth-on-month, both headline and core prices rose 0.3%.\nThe cooler-than-expected readings have sparked debate among market observers about the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Nigel Green, CEO of global advisory firm deVere Group, said the data gives the Fed room to cut interest rates but cautioned that policymakers are unlikely to act at their March meeting. “An annual rate of 2.4% places inflation back within a historically stable corridor for the US economy,” Green said. “Price growth is no longer running at levels that justify emergency-era restraint.”\n\nGreen noted that real interest rates remain positive, with the Fed’s target range at 3.5% to 3.75%. “Policy is still restrictive in real terms,” he said. “Borrowing costs are materially higher than underlying inflation. The stance was appropriate when inflation was surging, but it’s increasingly misaligned with present conditions.”\nHe urged the Fed to cut rates soon to prevent overtightening, especially in interest-sensitive sectors like housing and business investment. “A modest cut would maintain credibility while aligning policy with data,” he added. Despite this, Green said the central bank is likely to maintain a hawkish stance for now, emphasizing that inflation remains above its 2% target.\nMarket analysts also pointed to broader shifts in the inflation picture. Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, highlighted that consumer and corporate behavior is helping keep prices in check. “This CPI report didn’t just cool inflation—it shifted what matters next,” Bolvin said. “Consumers are pushing back, companies are absorbing costs, and pricing power is thinning. Markets responded because this gives the Fed flexibility—and shifts the investor focus away from rate cuts and back to fundamentals.”\n\nChris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management, echoed that the CPI reading was largely in line with expectations. “Although much has been made about whether the Fed can keep cutting interest rates this year, the markets seem to care much more about the possibilities of AI disruption across a broad swath of industries right now,” he said. “As long as CPI remains in check, the rates discussion will revert back to the labor market, and under current conditions the Fed is likely to proceed cautiously lowering rates a couple of times later this year.”\n\nStory Continues\nWells Fargo noted that the January report saw core CPI pushed up by a jump in airfares, offset by softer-than-expected used car and shelter costs. Headline and core inflation fell to 2.4% and 2.5% on a year-over-year basis, respectively, with core at its lowest since March 2021. Analysts said while a March rate cut is highly unlikely, the gradual disinflation trend keeps the possibility for easing later in the year alive.\nOverall, the January CPI report highlights a US economy in which inflation is moderating, giving the Fed flexibility while investors shift focus back to company fundamentals and economic growth rather than macro-driven rate moves.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "CPI surprise highlights Fed dilemma: cut now or wait?\n\nProactive\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:14 AM PST 3 min read\n\nUS inflation showed further signs of easing in January, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.4% year-over-year, below the 2.5% expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, held steady at 2.5%, its lowest level since March 2021.\nMonth-on-month, both headline and core prices rose 0.3%.\nThe cooler-than-expected readings have sparked debate among market observers about the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Nigel Green, CEO of global advisory firm deVere Group, said the data gives the Fed room to cut interest rates but cautioned that policymakers are unlikely to act at their March meeting. “An annual rate of 2.4% places inflation back within a historically stable corridor for the US economy,” Green said. “Price growth is no longer running at levels that justify emergency-era restraint.”\n\nGreen noted that real interest rates remain positive, with the Fed’s target range at 3.5% to 3.75%. “Policy is still restrictive in real terms,” he said. “Borrowing costs are materially higher than underlying inflation. The stance was appropriate when inflation was surging, but it’s increasingly misaligned with present conditions.”\nHe urged the Fed to cut rates soon to prevent overtightening, especially in interest-sensitive sectors like housing and business investment. “A modest cut would maintain credibility while aligning policy with data,” he added. Despite this, Green said the central bank is likely to maintain a hawkish stance for now, emphasizing that inflation remains above its 2% target.\nMarket analysts also pointed to broader shifts in the inflation picture. Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, highlighted that consumer and corporate behavior is helping keep prices in check. “This CPI report didn’t just cool inflation—it shifted what matters next,” Bolvin said. “Consumers are pushing back, companies are absorbing costs, and pricing power is thinning. Markets responded because this gives the Fed flexibility—and shifts the investor focus away from rate cuts and back to fundamentals.”\n\nChris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management, echoed that the CPI reading was largely in line with expectations. “Although much has been made about whether the Fed can keep cutting interest rates this year, the markets seem to care much more about the possibilities of AI disruption across a broad swath of industries right now,” he said. “As long as CPI remains in check, the rates discussion will revert back to the labor market, and under current conditions the Fed is likely to proceed cautiously lowering rates a couple of times later this year.”\n\nStory Continues\nWells Fargo noted that the January report saw core CPI pushed up by a jump in airfares, offset by softer-than-expected used car and shelter costs. Headline and core inflation fell to 2.4% and 2.5% on a year-over-year basis, respectively, with core at its lowest since March 2021. Analysts said while a March rate cut is highly unlikely, the gradual disinflation trend keeps the possibility for easing later in the year alive.\nOverall, the January CPI report highlights a US economy in which inflation is moderating, giving the Fed flexibility while investors shift focus back to company fundamentals and economic growth rather than macro-driven rate moves.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nGlobal Car Loan Market to Reach $2.49 Trillion by 2031 at 8.47% CAGR Driven by Rising Demand for Luxury Vehicles and New Vehicle Loan Growth, Reports Mordor Intelligence\n\nMordor Intelligence\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:11 AM PST 6 min read\n\nThe global car loan market growth is being accelerated by the rapid expansion of digital lending ecosystems enabling real-time loan approvals through fintech-driven API integrations, alongside increasing consumer appetite for premium and luxury vehicle financing across high-growth emerging economies.\n\nHyderabad, India, Feb. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to Mordor Intelligence’s report, the car loan market size was valued at USD 1.53 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow from USD 1.66 trillion in 2026 to USD 2.49 trillion by 2031 , registering a CAGR of 8.47% . The growth is being driven by rapid digitalization in lending, borrower-friendly regulatory reforms across major emerging economies, and shifting consumer preference toward seamless, technology-enabled financing. Asia-Pacific leads both in scale and growth, supported by policy changes in markets such as China and India that improve credit accessibility. Fintech-driven instant approvals are significantly shortening loan processing times, while captive finance arms deepen customer relationships. At the same time, stronger transparency in online used-vehicle marketplaces and growing commercial vehicle electrification are encouraging more innovative and flexible financing models.\n\nCar Loan Market Share by Region\nNorth America remains a mature yet highly innovative auto financing market, supported by sophisticated credit systems that enable precise risk-based pricing and large captive finance players managing extensive loan portfolios. Incentives for electric vehicles and the emergence of digital-first banks are widening product offerings and increasing pricing competition. Strong integration between dealerships and lenders streamlines origination processes, while continued digital transformation enhances customer experience through faster approvals and more personalized financing solutions.\nThe Asia-Pacific region held the largest position in the global car loan market share and is expected to remain the fastest-growing region. Regulatory reforms, including relaxed down-payment norms in China and enhanced borrower flexibility measures in India, have significantly improved credit access. Expanding middle-class vehicle ownership, rising electric vehicle adoption, and increasing fintech integration continue to reinforce the region’s leadership and long-term growth trajectory. Strong collaboration between banks, non-banking financial institutions, and digital lenders is further accelerating loan penetration. Additionally, supportive government policies and rapid urbanization are creating sustained demand for structured vehicle financing solutions across the region.\n\nStory Continues\nCar Loan Market Growth Drivers\nFintech Integration Accelerates Auto Loan Approvals\nThe expansion of API-driven lending platforms is reshaping auto finance by linking banks and credit unions with AI-powered underwriting systems that significantly reduce manual intervention. Borrowers now receive decisions within minutes, while lenders benefit from lower processing costs and improved operational efficiency. Adoption is advancing rapidly, particularly in North America where regulatory clarity supports open-banking frameworks. Institutions that fail to modernize their API infrastructure risk losing market share, as standardized data connectivity also enhances fraud monitoring and regulatory compliance.\n\nRising Influence of Captive Auto Finance Companies\nAutomakers are increasingly expanding their in-house financing divisions to strengthen control over customer relationships and capture greater value across the ownership cycle. With direct access to vehicle performance data, residual value trends, and service insights, captive lenders can structure more competitive and precisely priced loan offerings than many independent banks. Bundled packages that integrate insurance, software features, and maintenance contracts further enhance customer retention while creating recurring revenue streams, contributing meaningfully to overall car loan market growth. As a result, traditional lenders are pushed to compete through niche targeting or faster, technology-driven processes. This deeper integration also provides manufacturers with valuable consumer data that feeds back into product development and marketing strategies, reinforcing long-term car loan market growth.\n\nMajor Segments Highlighted in the Car Loan Market Report\nBy Vehicle Type\nPassenger Vehicle\nCommercial Vehicle\nBy Ownership\nNew Vehicles\nUsed Vehicles\nBy Provider Type\nBanks\nNon-Banking Financial Institutions\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nOther Provider Types (Fintech Companies)\nBy Tenure\nLess than 3 Years\n3–5 Years\nMore than 5 Years\nBy Region\nNorth America\nUnited States\nCanada\nMexico\nSouth America\nBrazil\nArgentina\nChile\nColombia\nRest of South America\nEurope\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\nFrance\nSpain\nItaly\nBenelux (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg)\nNordics (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland)\nRest of Europe\nAsia-Pacific\nChina\nIndia\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nAustralia\nSouth-East Asia (Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines)\nRest of Asia-Pacific\nMiddle East and Africa\nUnited Arab Emirates\nSaudi Arabia\nSouth Africa\nNigeria\nRest of Middle East and Africa\nOverview – Car Loan Industry\n\nStudy Period\n2020-2031\nMarket Size in 2026\nUSD 1.66 Trillion\nMarket Size Forecast 2031\nUSD 2.49 Trillion\nIndustry Expansion\nGrowing at a CAGR of 8.47% during 2026-2031\nFastest Growing Market for 2026-2031\nAsia Pacific is projected to record the fastest growth rate\nSegments Covered\nBy Vehicle Type, By Ownership, By Provider Type, By Tenure, and By Region\nRegions Covered\nNorth America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, the Middle East, and Africa\nCustomization Scope\nChoose tailored purchase options designed to align precisely with your research requirements.\n\nCar Loan Companies cover global and market-level insights, core business segments, available financial performance details, strategic initiatives, competitive positioning and market share of leading players, product and service portfolios, and recent developments.\nToyota Financial Services\nFord Credit\n\nAlly Financial\nChase Auto Finance\nWells Fargo Auto\nBank of America\nCapital One Auto Finance\nSantander Consumer USA\nBMW Financial Services\nHonda Financial Services\nHyundai Capital Services\nNissan Motor Acceptance Corp.\nGM Financial\nVolkswagen Financial Services\nTD Auto Finance\nSociété Générale – ALD Automotive\nHSBC Auto Loans\nWestlake Financial Services\nLithia Driveway Finance\nCarvana Finance (Bridgecrest)\nGet in-depth industry insights on the car loan market research report: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/car-loan-market ?utm_source=globenewswire\nExplore related reports from Mordor Intelligence\nOpen Banking Market Size : The global open banking market is expected to grow significantly, increasing from USD 25.91 billion in 2025 to USD 29.78 billion in 2026, and reaching USD 59.81 billion by 2031, reflecting a CAGR of 14.95%.

Subscribe to our free daily WealthManagement newsletters .\nBetterment has launched a pilot of its planned client referral program for a select group of registered investment advisors using its custodial platform, according to the firm and a recent regulatory filing.\n\nThe RIA custodian, robo advisor and 401(k) plan provider has started the Betterment Advisor Network to “connect select Betterment retail clients with independent RIAs on our platform for ongoing, personalized advice,” according to an emailed statement. “We’re beginning with a limited pilot program for a small group of advisors and plan to expand over time as we learn more about client demand and advisor needs.”\nIf a retail client elects to participate in the referral program, they will receive the names and contact information of one or more advisors using Betterment’s custodial services, according to a Feb. 10 regulatory filing . The advisor and client can then work out an agreement for services, with Betterment charging the advisor a 0.25% annual fee on the referred client’s account assets.\n\n“BAN Advised Clients who enroll in the referral program may be referred based on their financial situation and investment preferences, such as service needs, cost considerations, location and desired communication (remote or in-person),” according to the filing.\nThe firm launched the referral program to lure RIAs from custody giants Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, while also fending off other tech-focused competitors such as Altruist and Robinhood/TradePMR.&nbsp;\nLast year, BNY Pershing and Goldman Sachs’ Ayco also disclosed in regulatory filings that they had , or would soon launch, client referral programs .\nNew York-based Betterment currently has about 600 firms on its custodial platform, as well as 1 million clients across both retail and advisors representing more than $60 billion in assets.\nEarlier this week, the firm announced it had added asset manager offerings to its model marketplace from Goldman Sachs, State Street Investment Management and Vanguard.\n“Advisors are using our model marketplace to bring institutional investment expertise into their firms with less overhead,” Alison Considine, director of strategy and operations at Betterment Advisor Solutions, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This New ETF Bolsters ‘America First’ Tech Stocks in Defiance of 'Sell America' Trade\n\nRob Isbitts\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 8:07 AM PST 3 min read\n\nSome exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are all about quality stocks. Others are about themes that captivate investors, who will give the fund a look simply based on its name. CoreValues America First Technology ETF (USMD), a new actively managed fund launched earlier this month, will likely prove to be a mix of both of those strategies.\n\nThe new ETF aims to capitalize on what might turn out to be one of 2026’s biggest paradoxes. We all know the U.S. is the technology leader of the world. It has vaulted to that perch, starting with the rocking 1990s.\nMore News from Barchart A $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nBut that led to the dot-com bubble and subsequent crash. And just as USMD is hitting the market, the headlines are all talking about the “sell America” trade. That’s the phenomenon in which investors in and out of the United States essentially decide that it's high time for some geographical diversification.\n\nInvestment Strategy and ‘America First’ Focus The fund’s managers define eight categories that support U.S. national interests:\nArtificial intelligence (AI): Firms providing AI infrastructure, chips, and software platforms.\nDefense technology: Companies developing next-generation military aerospace, satellites, and space defense.\nCybersecurity: Providers of endpoint protection, zero-trust frameworks, and AI-driven threat response.\nSemiconductors: Manufacturers and designers of advanced microchips and electronic components.\nAutonomous systems: Developers of drones, robotics, and underwater systems for defense or civilian use.\nNuclear and power storage: Focused on uranium mining, small modular reactors (SMRs), and next-generation battery systems.\nRobotics and automation: Including industrial, collaborative, and surgical robots.\nDigital infrastructure: Supporting the backbone of modern connectivity and data processing.\nThe sub-adviser, MSA Power Funds, invests in about 120 stocks, 15 from each of those eight segments. As of a few days ago, the fund’s top 10 holdings looked like this:\nSymbol\nCompany\nWeight\n(JNJ)\nJohnson & Johnson\n5.77%\n(GOOG) (GOOGL)\nAlphabet\n5.06%\n(NVDA)\nNvidia\n5.04%\n(AVGO)\nBroadcom\n5.03%\n(TSLA)\nTesla\n4.88%\n(AMZN)\nAmazon\n4.31%\n(MSFT)\nMicrosoft\n4.27%\n(AMD)\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n3.94%\n(CSCO)\nCisco Systems\n3.86%\n(PLTR)\nPalantir Technologies\n3.43%\n\nNotably, one of the fund’s managers brings a background that includes work for the U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Defense. As we see above, the ETF’s top names are very familiar stocks, implying a large-cap bent.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line on USMD This ETF might have some added value to offer, but it is not yet apparent how. That’s because, like many ETFs, the top 10 to 20 holdings dominate. That has the effect of crowding out other portfolio names, which might be sources of return beyond what a typical S&P 500 market basket might bring. It will take some premium returns to get the fund noticed beyond the launch announcement, as it reportedly started with just $1 million in assets.\nBut with any ETF, whether or not there is a compelling case for the portfolio, there’s a big advantage often lost on investors. ETFs are, at their core, baskets of stocks based on research. That research might be a screen conducted at regular intervals to arrive at an index portfolio. Or, it could be an active process.\n\nEither way, with an ETF like USMD, there is one immediate use case. Specifically, for traders or investors looking for stocks to participate in the “American First” theme, looking at the fund’s updated holdings makes for a nice starting point.\nRob Isbitts created the ROAR Score , based on his 40+ years of technical analysis experience.

These requests contain numerous questions about Microsoft's licensing and other business practices.\n\nThe agency is looking for evidence that Microsoft makes it difficult for customers to use Windows, Office and other products on competing cloud services. Additionally, the FTC is seeking information about Microsoft's bundling of artificial intelligence, security, and identity software with other products like Windows and Office.\nThe investigation was initiated by former FTC chief Lina Khan during the final period of the Biden Administration. Under Donald Trump's second term, the probe continues with FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson now overseeing the investigation. The agency has been meeting with companies and other groups to gather information.\nThe investigation remains ongoing, and no final decisions have been made. FTC investigations do not always lead to enforcement actions.\nRelated articles\nFTC stepping up scrutiny of Microsoft’s cloud and AI practices\nWolfe Research outlines eight risks that could spark stock declines in 2026\nThis sector is 'poised for a big, beautiful year': Truist\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why January inflation data was a 'snoozer' for markets\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:57 AM PST\n\nIn this video: ^DJI\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nMarkets ( ^DJI , ^GSPC , ^IXIC ) had only a mild reaction to January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data .\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati and Rabobank head of FX strategy Jane Foley join Morning Brief host Julie Hyman to discuss what the inflation data signals for markets and the year ahead, how it couples with this week's jobs data , and more.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, I want to start with you and, um, let's talk about what this CPI number means or I guess doesn't mean given the not huge reaction to the markets here this morning.\n00:13 Amanda\nWell, it's great to be with both of you. Good morning. It's a little bit of a snoozer. It's it's Friday the 13th, but there was not a scary result by any means as it relates to the CPI data. and I think the market reaction is spot on. like a little bit improved versus overnight hours, but not enough to write home about. I think it really is enough though to say that the Fed could cut later in the year, not imminently.\n00:40 Amanda\nBut that trend line seems to be weaker and so that's, you know, modestly good news for the market. I think the market gets to just refocus on earnings, capx, AI, etc. So we're just getting this out of the way, I think for the market.\n00:54 Speaker A\nAnd Jane, what do you think? How do you how are you viewing sort of the backdrop here now? You know, if you put the jobs report on Wednesday together with the inflation data we got today in terms of the path for the Fed.\n01:05 Jane\nWell, again, you know, I would have to agree. if you look at the jobs data first, well, you know, that was better than expected and the market therefore became a little bit more fearful about when can the Fed cut interest rates next, maybe not until July. So it was focusing on the CPI report to see if that would bring any sort of clarity on that. And I don't think it's really changed the outlook very much at all because yes, okay, the the headline rate was a little bit better than expected, but the core one is important. That came in bang in line with expectations. And at the end of the day, even though economists for a while have been forecasting that US CPI inflation will decline this year. It's still right now above that 2% target level. So it's still a little bit on the firm side and and that probably leaves us exactly where we were ahead of this release with the anticipation that yeah, you know, the Fed can probably cut interest rates later on this year, but can it do it imminently? you know, maybe not just yet. So I don't think it's really changed the parameters very much at all.\n01:57 Speaker A\nSo let's talk a little bit then more about the backdrop and what we have seen um on your side, Amanda, in the equity markets this week where we have seen this sharp pull back in the overall averages, but also just real blood letting in specific stocks here. And and this real sensitivity to, you know, everything potentially threatened by AI. What do you think what do you think set all of this off? What do you think's going on here and is or is this just like what we can expect now?\n02:40 Amanda\nI it's it's a great question and it's hard to give you a precise answer. I think it's just a sign of the times uh a little bit, you know, valuations have gotten to such lofty levels. We don't think that anything AI related is necessarily in a bubble, but certainly elevated valuation levels and we're in the middle of Q4 earning season and while results are coming in, uh, you know, pretty pretty solid uh against a very high bar. I think investors are just saying, all right, well, when is all of the return on investment going to show up for the CAPEX that's going in and then a number of the big uh companies said, well, we're raising our CAPEX budgets. Investors don't really want to hear that. Um, I think it's a natural sign of the times though. I think I think there's a little bit of recalibration that needs to happen. It's natural, healthy, normal. We're still very much believers in the AI, uh automation, robotics, etc, secular themes and trends. So we're not particularly bothered by what's going on here. If there's a little bit more of a downdraft from what we've seen, I think we might lean in and pick up some names on a relatively more attractive basis. But what the good news is, I think even amidst the swoon is there's still signs of life.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Think You’re Too Old for Wealth? 4 Lessons To Learn From Jeff Bezos Getting Rich in His Mid-30s\n\nJosephine Nesbit\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:55 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos didn’t start in life as a billionaire. Bezos, among other ultra-wealthy, didn’t build their fortune — or even see success — until their mid-30s and sometimes even later.\nToday, he has an estimated net worth of just under $243 billion, according to Forbes , and is the fourth richest person in the world behind Elon Musk, Larry Page and Larry Ellison.\n\nSo if you think you’re too old for wealth, here are several lessons to learn from Bezos .\nStarting Later Doesn’t Mean You’re Behind While Bezos founded Amazon, the world’s largest e-commerce retailer, in 1994 out of his Seattle garage, he didn’t reach billionaire status until 1999, at age 35.\nIn the months leading up to the launch, Bezos and a few employees developed software for Amazon.com out of his garage, and he enlisted 300 friends to beta test his website, according to Biography . The startup then expanded into a two-bedroom house.\nWithin two months, sales reached $20,000 per week, and Amazon became a publicly-traded company on May 15, 1997. Two years later, Amazon outpaced competitors to become a leader in the e-commerce space. Yearly sales jumped from $510,000 in 1997 to $634 billion in 2024.\n\nOutside of Amazon, Bezos started the space exploration company, Blue Origin, and purchased The Washington Post and other publications affiliated with the parent company.\nDiscover More: If Bezos’ Wealth Was Evenly Distributed Across the US, How Much Would We Get?\nFind Out: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nLong-Term Thinking Pays Off One of Amazon’s core values has always been to think longer-term than most companies. According to Amazon executive Bill Carr, Amazon Prime Video was the result of a decade of research, development and content acquisition, Forbes reported.\nCarr added that while most companies will give up on an idea if it doesn’t produce quick returns, but Amazon will stick with it for five, six or seven years while continuing to learn and improve until it gains momentum.\nReinvest Early to Grow Faster Although Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon in 2021, he’s still an executive chairman and one of the company’s biggest shareholders, GOBankingRates previously reported. However, he didn’t bring in a big paycheck while he was in charge.\nBezos’ stipend salary from Amazon in 2020 was only $81,840, which qualifies as a middle-income wage in California.\nGrowth over profit was a goal from the beginning. According to Fundable, the company continued to “plow their revenue back into growth” within the first few months of success. Another big focus was long-term growth, with profit remaining around $0 or below while revenue increased.\n\nStory Continues\nTake Risks and Embrace Failure The Motley Fool pointed out that a big part of Bezos’ success was his willingness to take on risk and embrace failure. He left a high-paying finance job to start Amazon and made big early-stage investments that could have ended in failure.\nHe’s also talked about his “regret minimization framework,” which he uses to make big decisions . According to The Fool, he imagines he’s looking back on his life at age 80 and considers which decision will minimize the number of regrets he has.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nTrump's $2K Dividend: Who Qualifies and How You'll Get It\n6 Must-Have Winter Clothing Items To Buy at Costco\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Think You’re Too Old for Wealth? 4 Lessons To Learn From Jeff Bezos Getting Rich in His Mid-30s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Forget Invesco's S&P 500 ETF and Buy This Instead\n\nTodd Shriber, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: IVZ\n\n^GSPC\n\nOver the past several years, even casual investors have likely heard the term \"concentration risk.\" One of its interpretations refers to a small number of stocks commanding outsize percentages in supposedly diverse broad-market indexes.\nIndeed, that is the state of the S&P 500 today. As of Feb. 9, just five stocks accounted for approximately 27% of that index. Historically speaking, that's a higher percentage and reflects what can happen when indexes and funds weight components by market capitalization . Under that weighting methodology, when a stock's market value rises, it garners more weight in a cap-weighted index. It's that simple.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nEqual weighting is the elixir for the blues of concentration risk, and investors can tap into it through various exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT: RSP) . This $86.3 billion ETF, which turns 23 in April, tracks the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, a gauge that weights the S&P 500's holdings equally. That's easy enough for any investor to understand, but there are equal-weight alternatives to consider.\n\nA better way to equal weighting There's nothing wrong with the Invesco ETF per se, and although it's not a dedicated value fund , funds that equally weight stocks can benefit when smaller and value stocks are in fashion. But assigning the same allocations to individual stocks isn't the only way to go about equal weighting.\nThe ALPS Equal Sector Weight ETF (NYSEMKT: EQL) proves as much. This rival to the Invesco fund equally weights the 11 sectors represented in the S&P 500 by holding the 11 Sector SPDR ETFs issued by State Street Investment Management.\n\nIt's a weighting strategy to consider, particularly at a time when the ascent of some artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has the technology sector accounting for more than a third of the cap-weighted S&P 500. Tech accounts for just 8.5% of the ALPS ETF's roster.\nThis ETF's approach potentially benefits investors. As of the end of the third quarter of 2025, equally weighting the S&P 500 sectors outperformed assigning the same weights to stocks over the trailing 12-month, three-, five-, and 10-year periods.\nOne reason for the success of equal sector weighting is that the strategy doesn't water down the positive contributions from some popular stocks as much as equally weighting does. Using Nvidia as an example, neither the ALPS ETF nor the Invesco fund feature large weights to that stock, with no one stock accounting for more than 0.48% of the Invesco ETF.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's safe to say that Nvidia's bullish contributions are diluted in that fund. By equally weighting sectors, the ALPS ETF retains a greater share of the appreciation generated by high-market-cap names.\nAccomplished, but unheralded There's no denying that among equal-weight ETFs, the Invesco S&P 500 offering is one of the largest and best-known, but investing isn't a popularity contest.\nFor market participants unfamiliar with the ALPS alternative, it's over 16 years old and has $634 million in assets under management. In other words, it has an audience, and as the aforementioned returns confirm, it's rewarded investors' faith. Plus, t he annual expense ratio is fair at 0.27%, or $27 on a $10,000 position.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alps ETF Trust - Alps Equal Sector Weight ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Alps ETF Trust - Alps Equal Sector Weight ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alps ETF Trust - Alps Equal Sector Weight ETF wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $409,108 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,145,980 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 886 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

The company authorized a $4B share buyback program.\nRead: If you follow markets closely, Kalshi lets you profit directly from being right about what comes next.\nWestern Digital ( NASDAQ:WDC ) has delivered an exceptional start to 2026, with shares climbing 64.9% year-to-date through yesterday's close. The broader tech sector, measured by the Technology Select Sector SPDR ( NYSEARCA:XLK ), has slipped 0.68% in the same period.\n\nBest of all, Western Digital is now the second-best performer in the entire S&P 500, trailing only Sandisk's (Nasdaq: SNDK) incredible 166% jump. Not surprisingly, both stocks are rallying thanks to AI-driven demand.\nHowever, Western Digital's operational discipline and strategic positioning shouldn't be ignored.\nStrong Earnings Fuel the Rally Western Digital's fiscal Q2 2026 results, filed January 29, 2026, validated market enthusiasm. The company delivered revenue of $3.02 billion, beating the $2.95 billion consensus, while non-GAAP EPS of $2.13 topped estimates of $1.94.\nGross margin expanded to 46.1%, while operating income surged 6.57% year-over-year to $908 million. Net income jumped 210% to $1.84 billion, and free cash flow more than doubled, climbing 127.53% to $653 million.\nCEO Irving Tan framed the results around the company's core thesis: \"Western Digital's strong performance this quarter reflects our disciplined execution to meet demand in the AI-driven data economy, and the confidence our customers place in our ability to deliver reliable, high-capacity HDDs at scale.\"\n\nYear-over-year comps are more difficult as the company spun SanDisk off earlier in 2025, but the future looks bright. Wall Street sees Fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS at $8.86. In 2027, the Street is modeling growth up to $13.30. If current trends hold, those figures will likely underestimate Western Digital's earnings power.\nThe AI Storage Supercycle Western Digital operates at the intersection of two powerful tailwinds: the explosion of AI-generated data and hyperscaler appetite for cost-effective, high-capacity storage. On February 10, 2026, Western Digital unveiled its AI storage roadmap at WD Innovation Day, targeting 100TB hard drives by 2029 through new UltraSMR and HAMR technologies. This represents a fundamental shift in how data centers will store massive datasets required for AI model training and inference.\n\nStory Continues\nThe sector-wide momentum is undeniable. Seagate ( NASDAQ:STX ), Western Digital's primary competitor, has posted a 57% year-to-date gain.\nWhat's Next for 2026 Western Digital's Q3 guidance points to continued strength. The company expects revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, representing roughly 40% year-over-year growth. Analysts remain bullish, with 21 of 27 rating the stock a Buy or Strong Buy. Morgan Stanley ( NYSE:MS ) put a $369 price target on the stock, while Cantor Fitzgerald went higher at $420.\nThe company has also strengthened its balance sheet. In early February, Western Digital completed full redemption of its 4.750% Senior Notes due 2026, eliminating near-term debt maturities. It also authorized a $4 billion share buyback program, signaling management's confidence in sustained profitability.\n\nWestern Digital's 2026 start validates the company's transformation from a diversified storage player to a focused, high-margin provider of AI infrastructure. The rally has room to run if solid execution continues and hyperscalers keep building.\nTrade Outcomes, Not Opinions. Most investors are forced to guess how the market will react to news rather than trading the news itself. Kalshi flips that model by letting you trade directly on real world outcomes like interest rates, inflation prints, recessions, and the results are shocking.\nEach market is simple. You predict whether something will happen or not. If you are right, the contract pays out. Everyday people are printing money based on things they already know, and having a blast at the same time.",

Several commenters argued that by the time today’s 24-year-old reaches retirement age, they may need $3 million, $5 million or more to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nThen there is life itself.\nPeople shared stories of layoffs, illness, caregiving and emergencies that wiped out savings or forced them to pause contributions for years. “I started saving for retirement from 0 at 24,” one commenter said. “Then I started saving for retirement from 0 at 30. Thank you terminal illness and family caregiving.”\n\nStory Continues\n“It only takes one major, unfortunate life event to wipe out everything,” another warned,\nThe message was consistent: early momentum creates flexibility, but assuming nothing goes wrong is risky.\nSee Also: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nShould You Coast After $100,000? The original poster floated the idea of easing off after hitting $100,000 and only contributing enough to get their employer’s match.\nThis is where many commenters pushed back.\n“Every dollar you continue to save means retiring earlier,” one person wrote. Another warned against underestimating future costs, saying, “Money is meaningless unless measured against the task.”\nThe most common advice was not to plan on coasting just because the math allows it. Continuing to save creates options: earlier retirement, a larger buffer for emergencies, or simply less stress later.\n\nA few commenters also noted that retirement accounts are not the only way to build long-term wealth.\nFor younger investors thinking about diversification, Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, offering the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and properties across multiple markets, it has become an option for people who want real estate exposure without buying a home outright.\nStarting early really does matter. Getting debt-free young and investing consistently can result in enormous long-term advantages.\nRead Next: Security and regulation matter in crypto — explore Kraken Pro's compliance-first trading platform.\n\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "From software to real estate, U.S. sectors under the grip of AI scare trade\n\nMedha Singh and Sruthi Shankar\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:44 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nCRM\n\nADBE\n\nCWK\n\nBy Medha Singh and Sruthi Shankar\nFeb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street is in the grip of disruption worries from AI. It first started with investors dumping shares of software companies but soon spread to sectors seen as vulnerable to automation, driving sharp losses in U.S. stocks this week.\nThe AI scare trade did not spare even sectors ‌such as private credit, real estate brokers, data analytics, legal services and insurers.\n\nGlobal tech stocks took the hit after Anthropic unveiled a legal AI plug-in. But soon the investor unease ‌deepened following a flurry of AI model upgrades and fresh releases.\n\"With fear driving market sentiment, investors remain in 'sell first think later' mode, asking 'who is next' and showing no mercy for anything remotely seen as an AI loser,\" Barclays equity strategist ​Emmanual Cau said.\nHere's a look at how various sectors were impacted by the selloff:\nSOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE-EXPOSED LOANS\nThe S&P 500 Software & Services index has lost about $2 trillion in value since its peak in October. Half of the losses came in the past two weeks, on concerns that fast-advancing AI tools could upend traditional subscription and enterprise tools.\n\nSo far this year, the worst-performing Nasdaq 100 stocks include Atlassian down 47%, Intuit down 40% and Workday, which has lost a third of its value.\nSalesforce tumbled about 30% in 2026, while Adobe is down 25% and CrowdStrike 12%.\n\"There's this idea that AI is somehow going to replace built‑out models ‌in the near term - models that have been in place for ⁠many years and from which companies have profited strongly,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.\nThe U.S. software sector's worst drawdown in more than three years also knocked down shares of alternative asset managers on concerns over their exposure to loans and leverage tied to the ⁠companies.\nAres, Blackstone, Blue Owl, Apollo, TPG and KKR slumped between 13% and 24% this year.\n\nAbout a fifth of the private credit space is exposed to the software sector, according to estimates from BNP Paribas.\nFINANCIAL BROKERAGE, DATA ANALYTICS & LEGAL SERVICES\nThe financial industry, particularly brokerages and data analytics firms, were hammered after wealth management firm Altruist introduced AI-enabled tax planning features, stoking fears of the fast-advancing technology upending their business models.\nShares of brokers LPL Financial, ​Raymond ​James Financial and Charles Schwab fell more than 7% on Tuesday.\nIndex provider S&P Global, which issued a downbeat earnings ​forecast for 2026, has slumped more than 25% in February and was set ‌for its worst month since 2009. Moody's, Factset Research and MSCI also fell sharply this month.\n\nStory Continues\nNasdaq-listed shares of Thomson Reuters touched a near five-year low last week on concerns about AI hurting its legal services business.\nREAL ESTATE SERVICES\nCommercial real estate and investment managers took a blow on Wednesday, which KBW analysts said was due to investors rotating out of high-fee, labor-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.\n\nCBRE Group and Jones Lang LaSalle sank about 12% each on Wednesday, and Cushman & Wakefield slumped nearly 14%. CoStar Group, owner of Apartments.com and Homes.com, fell 5.9%.\n\"We view market concerns as overstated due to a combination of fragmented CRE end markets and the noncore nature of real estate activities for many clients,\" Morningstar analyst Sean Sunlop said, noting that their valuations were \"not cheap\" despite ‌the selloff.\nINSURANCE\nInsurance stocks took a sharp hit. Brokers and underwriters across both sides of the Atlantic plunged after ​online platform Insurify released on Monday an AI‑powered comparison tool on ChatGPT, which allows users to compare car insurance rates.\nThe ​S&P 500 insurance index slumped 3.9% on Monday, its biggest single-day drop since mid-October.\n\nShares ​of insurance broker Willis Towers Watson have shed 15% so far this week and were set for its worst week since the pandemic-selloff in March 2020. ‌Aon fell 9% and Arthur J. Gallagher dropped 15% this week.\n\"Ultimately, we believe ​brokers will bifurcate. Simpler insurance products like term life, ​personal auto, and home, could see significant AI disruption over the next five years,\" Morgan Stanley equity strategist Bob Jian Huang said.\n\"Higher-valued brokers will use AI to enhance analysis and improve underwriting, not be displaced by it, in our view.\"\nTRUCKING & LOGISTICS\nTraders probably did not see trucking and logistics firms as an AI target, but the sector plunged sharply on Thursday.\nAI-focused ​logistics firm Algorhythm Holdings, which previously sold karaoke machines, said its ‌SemiCab unit boosted customers' freight volumes by 300% to 400% \"without a corresponding increase in operational headcount\".\nThe news triggered a rout in stocks such as Landstar System and C.H. ​Robinson. The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 4.4%.\nJefferies analysts, however, said the reaction was disconnected from fundamentals. \"Proprietary freight data and physical networks remain durable moats,\" they said.\n(Reporting ​by Medha Singh and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Avinash P; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

When the Jeff Bezos-founded company went public in May of 1997, it was still an online bookselling startup that had been in business only a couple of years. Today, Amazon ranks as the fifth-biggest company in the world by market cap.\n\nWhat if you had bought Amazon stock the year it made its initial public offering (IPO)? Assuming you still own that stock today, you’re probably worth a lot of money .\nBasics of Amazon Stock Amazon’s stock debuted on the Nasdaq on May 15, 1997, at an IPO price of $18 a share, according to the company’s website . But everyday investors probably didn’t get that price.\nAs The Motley Fool reported, IPO prices are typically reserved for underwriting investment banks and other institutional investors. But if you bought the stock on its first day of trading, you probably paid about $23.50 per share. That was the first-day closing price, according to The Motley Fool.\nSince the IPO, Amazon has announced four stock splits : June 2, 1998 (2-for-1 split); January 5, 1999 (3-for-1); September 1, 1999 (2-for-1); and June 3, 2022 (20-for-1). Accounting for those splits, one share of Amazon stock on the first day of trading has now ballooned to 240 shares.\n\nAmazon’s stock hit highs in late 2025 and has since come down a bit, closing at $208.72 on Feb. 10. Even with that drop, the stock has risen at a mind-boggling rate since the IPO.\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nWhat Would Your Stock Be Worth Today?

Nolan\nExecutive Vice President & CFO — John M. Moreira\nVice President, Investor Relations — Rima Hyder\nFull Conference Call Transcript Joseph R. Nolan: Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Nolan\nExecutive Vice President & CFO — John M. Moreira\nVice President, Investor Relations — Rima Hyder\nFull Conference Call Transcript Joseph R. Nolan: Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Nolan\nExecutive Vice President & CFO — John M. Moreira\nVice President, Investor Relations — Rima Hyder\nFull Conference Call Transcript Joseph R. Nolan: Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

And thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I am pleased to report that 2025 was another year of strong execution across the organization. Our team delivered excellent operational performance, continued to advance critical infrastructure needs for our customers, leveraging technology solutions to lower O&M costs, and remained focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers and communities we are proud to serve. We also made meaningful progress working collaboratively with state policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to address critical priorities like affordability while remaining focused on reliability. This remains a top priority for Eversource Energy.\n\nOur goal is to ensure state leaders have the tools they need to support customers and that we have the regulatory clarity to make the investments essential to balancing affordability and reliability. These challenges can only be solved through true partnerships, working together face to face with shared goals. Moving to Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2025 accomplishments. Starting with our financial performance, I am proud to report that we delivered on our commitment of non-GAAP earnings with full-year earnings per share of $4.76. We also paid dividends of $3.01 per share to our shareholders, representing a 5.2% increase. Moving on to Slide 5.\nIn 2025, our employees once again demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence. Throughout the year, we delivered high levels of service reliability, responded effectively to several significant weather events, and continued making progress on projects that strengthen the resiliency and sustainability of our electric, natural gas, and water systems. As a result, we had top decile performance for both the MAIFI and the SAIDI metrics. That demonstrates our investments vastly improve reliability for customers. With this high level of performance, our electric customers, on average, experience an outage only once in nearly two years. We successfully deployed over $4,000,000,000 in capital investments in 2025.\n\nOur team has advanced grid modernization initiatives, expanded customer energy efficiency programs, and continued supporting the region's long-term decarbonization goals. These efforts reinforce our role as a trusted partner for New England's clean energy future and demonstrate our ability to execute consistently across a broad set of priorities. Our advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI, program, has officially reached over 100,000 smart meter installations in Massachusetts, a significant milestone in this multiyear effort to upgrade more than 1,500,000 meters statewide and deliver more modern tools with greater functionality that will benefit customers. On the regulatory front, we obtained several constructive decisions that will support ongoing infrastructure needs, including rate outcomes and cost recovery mechanisms that align with our infrastructure investment needs.\n\nStory Continues\nWe advanced key grid modernization initiatives, progressed on storm cost proceedings, with 98% of our $2,000,000,000 in deferred storm cost in current rates or pending cost prudence reviews, and we continue to engage with policymakers on the affordability and reliability implications of the region's energy transition and address load growth. Our commitment to building strong regulatory relationships is enabling productive dialogue in all three state jurisdictions. The outcomes we obtained last year reflect a shared recognition of the importance of modernizing the distribution system while keeping customer affordability at the forefront.\n\nLast month in Massachusetts, we worked with Governor Healey's administration to implement a rate relief plan for electric and gas customers, which is a constructive step in support of affordability for Massachusetts customers. The plan provides customer discounts in February and March during peak winter usage. The discounts are partly funded by the state and we will gradually recover our portion of the discounts over the lower-usage period this year. This approach aligns with our efforts to smooth bill impacts for our customers.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2025, and over the last twelve months, ending September 30, we have delivered an improvement of more than 400 basis points in our FFO-to-debt ratio at Moody's as a result of the cash flow enhancements previously outlined. Maintaining this improvement will be a continued key focus area for us in 2026. In January 2025, we broke ground on the Cambridge underground substation, a $1,800,000,000 investment which is the largest underground substation in the nation, a critical investment in strengthening the electric system that serves one of the fastest-growing and most energy-intensive areas of our region. Construction on this project continues to progress very well.\n\nWe completed the construction of the onshore substation for the Revolution Wind Project late last year, and as Ørsted recently announced, the project is expected to achieve first power within the coming weeks. Ørsted has also stated that construction of Revolution Wind has resumed since the preliminary injunction on the recent stop work order was granted, and the project is 87% complete. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates, we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in 2025. Another one of our proud accomplishments for the seventh year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource Energy as one of America's Most Responsible Companies.\nThis recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social, and corporate governance areas. This recognition is a reflection on the hard work and dedication of nearly 11,000 Eversource Energy employees who do the right thing every day and I want to sincerely thank them for that. Moving to Slide 6. As we look at 2026, our priorities remain clear and well aligned with the needs of the region. First, we will continue to deliver top-tier operational performance for our customers. Maintaining high reliability, enhancing customer experience, and ensuring the safety of our workforce and the public are our core commitments.\n\nSecond, we will advance our infrastructure investment program, including grid modernization, resiliency projects, and targeted upgrades that support reliability today while enabling the clean energy transition of tomorrow. The service we provide is critical, and replacing the aging infrastructure and addressing capacity requirements to meet demand growth is extremely important for our customers. John will discuss in greater detail our new five-year capital investment plan of $26,500,000,000. This new plan increases our necessary infrastructure investment over the next five years by $2,300,000,000.\nThe majority of this increase is aimed at electric and natural gas distribution investments to address aging infrastructure needs under multiyear projects such as the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, the underground cable modernization program, as well as complying with applicable state safety regulations. Third, we will continue to actively pursue our constructive engagement with regulators and stakeholders in each of our states. New leadership in government brings fresh perspectives, new conversations, and new opportunities to partner in shaping the future of energy in our region. In Massachusetts, our smart meter initiative is a cornerstone of that future, offering customers more insight, more control, and more connection to the way they use energy.\n\nLast year in Connecticut, we reached an agreement to sell Aquarion Water Company. This decision followed a thoughtful and disciplined review of our investment portfolio. We were disappointed with PURA's initial decision; we will continue to work with them on the judge's remand. The commission recently announced that we can expect a revised draft and final decision in March. Aquarion is a well-run business with a strong local team, and this transaction positions the water system for continued investments under a dedicated water operator while also delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, as this business is still part of Eversource Energy, we have provided PURA with notice of intent to file a rate case for Aquarion, consistent with our responsibility to seek appropriate recovery for ongoing investments that ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable water service for customers. We will also begin our first rate review in Connecticut for CL&P in about eight years. We see that as an incredible opportunity to show how we are providing best-in-the-industry reliability and that those investments are valuable to customers. Another key item for us is our recovery of storm costs.\n\nWe expect to receive a decision from PURA on our Connecticut storm cost prudency review in July, which would allow us to begin the legislative-backed securitization process. Importantly, securitization enables timely cash collection, improving our FFO-to-debt metrics while reducing near-term bill impacts for customers. This year, we are also looking at how we thoughtfully and responsibly use artificial intelligence, which is helping us reimagine how we work, from safety to line inspections to system planning to customer service and even leveraging AI in how we prepare and respond to regulatory proceedings. Using AI to optimize our system operations can reduce costs for our customers. And finally, we will continue to execute with financial discipline.\n\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet, prudent capital deployment, and delivering stable, predictable long-term value for our stakeholders. I want to thank our employees across the organization for their commitment, professionalism, and exceptional work throughout 2025. Your dedication is the foundation of everything we do, and it positions us well for another productive year ahead and continued long-term success with a keen eye on enhancing our earnings and derisking our business profile. 2026 will be a truly transformational year for us. As we operate within a changing regulatory landscape and navigate affordability concerns, we are driving forward on several major fronts.\nWe are executing relentlessly on completing our offshore wind commitments, enhancing storm cost securitization, and managing a potential sale of Aquarion. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering top-decile operational performance across our systems to continue to deliver on our customers' expectations. This combination of strategic execution and operational excellence positions us to achieve earnings growth towards the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS range by 2028. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss this long-term growth trajectory, as well as our results. Thank you. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\n\nThis morning, I will review 2025 full-year earnings results, provide a regulatory update, share our updated five-year capital investment plan, and provide our 2026 EPS guidance, our five-year financing strategy, and our long-term earnings growth expectation. Let me start on Slide 8 with a review of our 2025 earnings results. Our GAAP results for 2025 were earnings of $4.05 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.27 per share in 2024.\nGAAP results for 2025 include a net loss of $75,000,000, or $0.20 per share, related to an increase in our liability for expected future obligations to Global Infrastructure Partners as part of the 09/30/2024 sale of South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, net of tax effects associated with the sale of these projects. For the quarter, our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP earnings results were $1.12 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.20 per share for 2024, and non-GAAP earnings results of $1.01 per share for 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, GAAP results for the full year 2024 included a net loss of $2.30 per share related to the divestiture of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter of last year, as well as a loss on a potential sale of Aquarion Water, which we recognized in 2024. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.76 per share for the full year 2025, as compared to $4.57 per share in 2024. As you may recall, our revised non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2025 was in the range of $4.72 to $4.80.\nBreaking down the 2025 full-year earnings by segment, electric transmission earned $2.09 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $2.30 per share in 2024. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability and demand growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.80 per share in 2025 as compared with earnings of $1.77 per share in 2024. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversource Energy's Massachusetts and New Hampshire businesses, partially offset by higher O&M, interest costs, depreciation, and property taxes. The natural gas distribution segment earned $0.97 per share in 2025 as compared with $0.81 per share in 2024.\n\nThe improved earnings results were due to base distribution rate increases at Eversource Energy's natural gas businesses and continued investment in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure with a focus on safety. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, which included a $12,200,000 charge as part of NSTAR Gas' settlement agreement with the Attorney General's office in December 2025, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and property tax expense. Eversource Energy Parent and Other reflected a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share in 2025 as compared with a GAAP loss of $2.46 per share in 2024. These results include the impact from our offshore wind divestiture and the potential Aquarion sale that I discussed earlier.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Eversource Energy Parent and Other loss was $0.22 per share in 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP loss of $0.16 per share in 2024. This higher loss was primarily driven by increased interest costs offset by the benefit from a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General for the recovery of previously incurred EGMA integration costs, as approved by the DPU, and to a lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2025, a solid financial year despite the challenges we faced. We are proud to have delivered another year of recurring non-GAAP earnings and dividend growth.\nTurning to our updated five-year capital plan for 2026 through 2030, as shown on Slide 9, reflects our utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this five-year period from 2026 through 2030, we expect to invest approximately $26,500,000,000 in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses, representing a $2,300,000,000 increase as compared to our prior five-year plan and a $1,500,000,000 increase from 2026 through 2029, the overlapping period. The $26,500,000,000 does not include Aquarion Water, which would amount to an additional $1,300,000,000 over this five-year period.\n\nThis infrastructure investment plan and reliable service will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe support, load growth, and address our state's clean energy objectives. Looking at the $1,500,000,000 increase from a segment standpoint as shown on Slide 10, electric distribution is the largest driver of the increase at $696,000,000. Our updated capital forecast now includes over $11,000,000,000 of electric distribution investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and top-tier electric reliability for our customers. This level of investment is primarily driven by the Massachusetts Electric Sector Modernization Plan as well as over $300,000,000 remaining for the AMI program in Massachusetts.\nThe next driver of the increase in our capital investment plan is natural gas distribution at $523,000,000. The updated capital forecast plan includes nearly $7,000,000,000 of natural gas distribution investments, centered around reliability and safety. Contributing to this increase are a variety of mandatory safety regulations that recently became effective, which represents approximately 25% of the growth in this gas distribution plan. Our transmission plan increased by $233,000,000 for the overlapping period. The revised plan includes over $7,000,000,000 of infrastructure investments over the next five years. These investments include replacement of aging infrastructure to harden the system, and increase resiliency during extreme weather events, as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and load growth.\n\nRounding out our capital plan, investments in technology and facilities, which increased by $75,000,000 and now is forecasted at $1,200,000,000, including cybersecurity investments, AI tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently, and tools to protect customer information. As shown on Slide 11, the transmission capital plan includes future ESMIP substations towards the end of the five-year forecast period. For this reason and to address load growth for the New England region, the plan includes sizable transmission investments for NSTAR Electric, which will have the largest transmission rate base in our service territory, projected at nearly $8,000,000,000 by 2030. The resultant impact to rate base from the updated capital investment plan is shown on Slide 12.\n\nThe customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8.3% growth in rate base from 2024 through 2030. On the regulatory front, we had another busy year with encouraging results. Our key 2025 regulatory proceedings are highlighted on Slide 13. Highlighting some recent outcomes, starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our PBR rate adjustments with a $55,000,000 increase for NSTAR Electric implemented on January 1 and a $10,000,000 increase for NSTAR Gas effective 11/01/2025. Also in Massachusetts, we received approval to implement a settlement agreement that included the recovery of EGMA acquisition and integration costs and to solve some longstanding regulatory matters related to pension and other deferred cost recovery items.\n\nEGMA integration costs at $82,000,000 will be recovered over a ten-year period and will be implemented as part of our next EGMA rate case. The pension and other costs settlement will result in a onetime bill credit for NSTAR Electric customers in 2026 of approximately $20,000,000. This impact was recognized in 2025. Lastly, in Massachusetts, we successfully worked with the Attorney General's office on a settlement which was approved by the DPU for the NSTAR Gas rate base roll-in, which resulted in a $45,000,000 base rate increase and a onetime customer credit of $12,200,000, which will be effective in 2026. This impact was also recognized in 2025. In Connecticut, we continue to pursue the sale of Aquarion Water with PURA.\nIn January, the Superior Court overturned PURA's denial of the Aquarion sale and sent the transaction back to PURA on remand to address some items. The court agreed with our argument that the first decision was legally incorrect, finding that PURA lacked the authority to reject the legislatively mandated governance structure of the newly created Aquarion Water Authority. On February 4, PURA issued a new procedural schedule that includes briefs, a proposed decision with an opportunity for written exceptions, and a final decision to be issued on March 25. We will continue to engage with PURA and all stakeholders as the process moves\n\nRima Hyder: ahead.\nJoseph R. Nolan: We recognize the uncertainty surrounding the Aquarion sale and our priority is to ensure that Aquarion continues to make necessary system investments to maintain reliable service for customers. As a result, we have submitted a notice of intent to PURA disclosing our plan to file a rate case for Aquarion, seeking a preliminary rate request of $88,000,000 in additional revenues. This rate request is necessary so that we can support the system long term in the event that PURA does not approve our application for the sale of Aquarion. Let me now talk about our financing needs over the next five years.\nWithout the Aquarion proceeds, we anticipate incremental financing needs and we are reviewing a number of alternatives to ensure we continue to fund the business efficiently. Looking at Slide 14, you can see our financing activities. Overall, we need to fund $27,800,000,000 of infrastructure investments, which includes Aquarion and dividends in the range of $6,700,000,000 to $7,200,000,000 for a total cash need of $34,500,000,000 to $35,000,000,000. Over the next five years, we expect cash flows from operations to be in the range of $24,200,000,000 to $24,700,000,000, which would fund nearly 70% of our cash needs. We are looking at approximately $8,500,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 to come from incremental debt and other financing solutions.\n\nWithin this range, we are looking at various alternatives for these solutions, such as junior subordinated notes, minority interest sale, or minority-like capital structured financing transactions. These alternative financing solutions would qualify for equity content in the range of $1,300,000,000 to $2,500,000,000. We expect a decision from PURA regarding storm prudency that would allow us to move forward with securitization and anticipate proceeds of up to $1,500,000,000, providing roughly 3% of the cash inflows. Should an Aquarion sale occur, we would use the proceeds to lower the need for these alternative financing solutions. If we do not close on Aquarion, we would look towards these alternative financing solutions to meet our financing needs.\n\nThe remaining cash needs would come from equity issuances of roughly $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. It is important to note that this equity need is not impacted by the Aquarion sale. As Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 15, we have followed through on our commitment to cash flow and balance sheet improvements, with over 400 basis points of enhancement on the FFO-to-debt metrics at Moody's and 300 basis point improvement at S&P for 2025. Assuming no Aquarion sale, our financing plan for the five-year forecast is built to maintain at least 100 basis point cushion over the S&P and Moody's downgrade threshold each year.\nNext, I will turn to our 2026 earnings guidance on Slide 16. Our guidance this year does not assume that the Aquarion sale will occur, and therefore, we have included water segment earnings as part of our full-year guidance. With that said, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 for 2026. For 2026, we expect earnings growth to be more moderate due primarily to the timing of key regulatory outcomes. Importantly, we view the 2026 headwinds as transitory and not reflective of the underlying strength of the business or our long-term growth outlook. These outcomes include the potential sale of Aquarion, the recovery of storm costs in Connecticut as well as in New Hampshire.\n\nThe positive drivers impacting our guidance this year include transmission investments to improve system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, distribution rate increases thanks to our PBR mechanisms in Massachusetts and now in New Hampshire, and our strong focus on managing O&M expense. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investments, higher interest costs, the impact of share dilution, and a higher effective tax rate. Turning to Slide 17.\nAs we move into 2027 and 2028, we expect a meaningful inflection in earnings growth driven by improved regulatory outcomes, recovery of storm costs, completion of alternative financing opportunities, and distribution rate adjustments, including the result of CL&P rates request in 2027. As a result, while 2026 reflects a year of transformation, we see clear upside starting in 2027 and continuing throughout the forecast period. We are projecting the five-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of our 2025 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.76 per share.\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth towards the upper half of our long-term target of 5% to 7% by 2028. Just to be clear, this expectation would be off of the expected 2027 earnings results. In closing, our long-term fundamentals remain firmly intact. We have line of sight to improving our earnings as we move beyond 2026, supported by constructive regulatory progress, capital investments moving into rate base in a timely manner, and continued focus on disciplined execution. Importantly, from an earnings growth perspective, these drivers provide increasing visibility into 2027 and beyond. Adding to this is a resilient, regulator portfolio of investments, a steadily improving balance sheet, and a clear strategy for long-term value creation.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value over time. I will now turn the call back to Rima for Q&A.\nRima Hyder: Daniel, we are ready for our Q&A now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now open for questions. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Shahriar. Morning. Morning, Joe. So just really quickly, first one is, obviously, Joe, your growth trajectory is\nShahriar Pourreza: predicated on the balance sheet and funding, and you say, like, obviously, financing is somewhat flexible. If you sort of get the Aquarion sale approval on March 25 and storm cost recoveries, that will obviously eliminate the hybrids, but could that also take out some of the straight equity? And could that situation so post sale and storm cost recoveries be accretive to the five to seven since you are already at the upper half under a base assumption and a lot of your funding needs will be eliminated. Thanks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah. I am going to let John touch on that. Hey, Shahriar. So to start off with how are you, to start off with, we, you know, the approach we are taking just to your point, given the uncertainty around the Aquarion deal, is, you know, we have given you all kind of a range of potential alternatives. As I said in my prepared remarks, that level of $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 of common equity issuances does not is not impacted by whether or not the Aquarion transaction is completed. Where we have the flexibility is in the debt and the alternative financing to your point. I do expect us, as you know, we have not issued any junior subordinated debt.\nSo the expectation is with or without Aquarion, we do expect to go to market with that instrument.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: And that is despite storm cost recoveries?\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yes. Storm cost recoveries will come in 2027. And given the procedural schedule that PURA just issued, with a final decision by July, we probably will not be able to do the securitization and get the cash in the door until Q3 timeframe of 2027. So that is why we feel that even with an Aquarion sale moving forward, we still need to go to market with these junior subs. As you know, it is accretive to issuing straight equity. And yeah, yeah, let me just leave it at that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Yeah. And your five to seven. So, obviously, in that situation, you would need less funding and your base assumptions already at the higher end of five to seven. Correct. Yes. Exactly, Shahriar.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Correct. So where we have the leverage, a push and pull is Aquarion happens, then the alternative financing solutions will be pulled back. So I would view it this way. With an Aquarion deal closing in a timely fashion, it moves our growth rate for the outer years to a much better spot.\nShahriar Pourreza: Alright. That is perfect. Okay. And then just last another obviously uncertain here is Revolution Wind. I guess, where do we stand on potential post-close liabilities to Ørsted? And at what point does that liability end? So like, at EEI, you guys mentioned first power was the cutoff point. So does that mean that if the project reaches first power, even if the BOEM lawsuits are still ongoing, you are off the hook? Yeah. You know, thank you. You know, I will tell you, from\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: we have not had this level of clarity around some of the uncertainty, certainly in my tenure as CEO. We expect first power in the next couple of weeks. That is not the trigger, though. The trigger is COD. We deliver it just as we did with South Fork. We feel very comfortable with the number that we are carrying now. I am watching weather as we speak, and we expect that sixtieth turbine to head out to the lease area. And we will have first power in a few weeks. So it is going very, very well. All the land construction that we were responsible for was done.\nSo, you know, you take Revolution Wind and the clarity around that and the end being very near. You take the Aquarion decision coming in March, whether it is approved or not, at least it is bringing clarity. You have got storm costs recovery. You have got a decision coming in July. We already have the securitization vehicle in place. So all of these things, coupled with the rate base roll-in that we got in Massachusetts, we feel very, very comfortable about our future.\n\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Joe, one more. Yeah. Good. Just to be clear,\nJoseph R. Nolan: we do not have any liability to Ørsted. Our obligation is to GIP, just for\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Right. Right. Right.\nJoseph R. Nolan: Thanks, guys. Yep.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly S. Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Morning, Carly. Hey, morning.\nCarly S. Davenport: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the sources and uses of cash. Maybe could you just dive in a little bit more on what could potentially make sense from a minority interest sale standpoint and how you might consider structuring that in the context of regulatory approval needs.\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. Sure, Carly. This is John. So that is we are looking at, as I said in my formal remarks, we are looking at many alternatives. I would say from a minority interest sale, we, you know, we are looking at kind of a traditional equity and pseudo-equity interest.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Or a kind of think of it as a minority interest capital structure deal. It is a little bit different than a true minority interest in the equity position at a line of business or at one of our utilities. So I think it is a little premature for us to start talking about the level of details because that would be, you know, we are not looking to do that immediately. It is just something that we have on the table or, as I like to refer, it is the tool that we have in our toolkit.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And then you are still highlighting a billion dollars of upside to the new capital plan tied to Connecticut AMI. Obviously, a lot going on in Connecticut at the moment, so just kind of any sense of when you think from a timing standpoint, you could get some resolution on that and potentially see that start to roll into the plan?\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: Yeah, sure. So we expect that we will be meeting in Connecticut on AMI. All we want really is to get, you know, a waiver of the prudence standard and then we will have to update the implementation schedule. And that meeting is going to be next week. So we are optimistic that we can at least get additional clarity around, number one, the\nJoseph R. Nolan: desire and the rules of the road down there to make it fair\nJoseph R. Nolan: for us to make that investment. But we are not going to make the investment until we feel comfortable with the recovery mechanism. As you know, we have got a lot of money on the line down there right now, and we want to get our storm costs back. We have got a CL&P rate case. And if AMI is important to them, we certainly are ready to implement. You know, I am thrilled to tell you that 100,000 meters have been put in Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan: It is going very, very well.\nJoseph R. Nolan: And I think it is going to be a great opportunity for the customers of Connecticut to be able to enjoy the benefits of AMI. And I think that we are in a good position to be able to deliver on that. And, Carly, I would just add that billion dollars that we have on the slide, you need to, at this point in time, view that as a placeholder. That number from a cost perspective is kind of stale. So the team is looking at updating that. As Joe mentioned, we do have some discussions happening next week, and we will file a revised cost estimate for that program.\nCarly S. Davenport: Great. That is really clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Apicelli with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Bill. Hey, Bill. Hey, good morning. Just going back one step to something you guys said earlier. And I think make sure I understand it. When you guys say that the, you know, upper half toward the upper half, I guess, one that just to be clear, that means, you know, into the upper half in 2028. And then and when you say you mean rebasing that essentially off of the 2027. Right? So you are not there is no risk of rebasing, you know, off the 2026, which is obviously a lower number. Right? When you say you sort of off of 2027, you are referring to more normalized earnings power in 2027.\nAnd then growing into the upper half into 2028. That is the intention there? That you are spot on, and that is why in my formal remarks, I made it perfectly clear as to what the base year was. So we will, you know, the expectation is we are going to be at the upper half, which implies over 6% off of the earnings that we deliver for 2027.\n\nOperator: Alright. Understood.\nJohn M. Moreira: And then as far as the tax benefits from South Fork and how much of that is reflected in earnings for 2026? And what is the runway there? From an ITC standpoint, associated with our tax equity ownership, zero. We have not dipped into that bucket yet. So we still have roughly $500,000,000 that we will be utilizing in the coming years. And quite honestly, you know, that it will allow us to be, for all intents and purposes, a noncash taxpayer, certainly at the federal level, for the next several years and hopefully towards even the tail end of our forecast period. Okay.\nAnd then so you are utilizing other credits that are available to you this year to preserve\nOperator: Correct.\nJohn M. Moreira: I mean, yeah, we always have puts and takes from a credit standpoint, a tax standpoint. As I continue and as I have highlighted throughout 2025, we were able to harvest a bit more than what we were planning on. And I also guided you all that do not expect it to be at the same level for 2026. So and then, Bill, I just want to clarify that the IT credits that we are yet to utilize, those do not generate a P&L impact, just to be clear. So that is strictly a cash.\n\nOperator: Right.\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the last question, just, you know, any other, you know, color you can give on drivers, you know, into 2027 because of sort of the importance of that? You know, obviously, the CL&P case, is there anything else you can sort of frame out when we think about, you know, how earnings will shape up in 2027 over this 2026 number you gave today? Sure, Bill. And thank you for raising that question. To address that topic, we did introduce a brand-new slide that I hope you find, everyone finds useful. It highlights those major drivers and the timing of when we would expect to start materializing.\nSo if you look at that slide, Slide 17 in the deck that we disseminated, we have the Aquarion transaction. We have the storm case. We have the Aquarion rate case. We have the securitization, and we have Revolution getting behind us. All key overhangs that we have had for a long time will now be solidified in 2026.\n\nOperator: Great.\nJohn M. Moreira: So the 2027 enhancements will be, obviously, if Aquarion closes, the CL&P rate case. As we continue to forecast, we will likely file that case midyear of 2026 with a rate adjustment kicking in midyear of 2027. And the storm cost prudency securitization transaction will happen, you know, around 2027. So those are the major drivers that will give us the momentum from a growth standpoint into 2027 and beyond. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Good morning, Sophie.\nRima Hyder: Sophie. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nSophie Karp: So\nRima Hyder: I guess I am wondering, can you give us some sense when is the COD on the Revolution Wind going to occur after you have first power,\n\nSophie Karp: like which you will have in a few weeks? Like, what is the timeline there? And then just will you press release that? Will we know that, or it is going to wait till the next time, therefore?\nJohn M. Moreira: Yeah. You know, we are targeting the second half of 2026. We are very, very pleased with the progress. As you know, we have pulled that schedule in significantly. It continues to improve. I see nothing standing in the way of that schedule only getting better. And, you know, the only situation that we worry about is weather and something that none of us can control. But so 2026 at this point, yeah, and as we get more clarity, as we get first power another week or two, I think that, you know, Ørsted actually has the lead, we are not really the one that is able to disclose that. You know, we will give updates to the market.\n\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is all I had.\nOperator: Yep. Thank you. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone. Wait for your name to be announced. Again, that is 11. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Moreira: Morning, Paul. Good morning. So\nPaul Patterson: just to sort of and I apologize for being a little slow on this. With the Aquarion sale, what is the difference if you get it or you do not? In terms of the incremental amount of equity or equity hybrids that we are talking about. Could you just spell that out for me? I just I am not completely clear. I apologize.\nJohn M. Moreira: Sure. So once again, Paul, this is John. No change to what we just rolled out as our equity needs, $800,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 from a pure play equity raise. Where we have the flexibility is in the other alternative financing. We were assuming that in the current transaction to get $1,600,000,000 of the equity portion of the sale of Aquarion. So that is what you should think about as being the impact. And also, we will put them on notice, you know, if we do not transact, we will file for rate case to improve those earnings down there as well. I mean, it is a phenomenal asset.\n\nWe made the decision to exit that business to improve our balance sheet. That was a decision that we made. But if, in fact, we do not exit it, it still is a very, very good business.\nPaul Patterson: Yes. I see that you also, on the Eversource Gas benefit in the fourth quarter, that if I read the press release correctly, it was in the parent. I was just wondering, could you how much was that? And\nOperator: and why is it in the parent and not in the gas business? Or\nPaul Patterson: what am I missing?\nJohn M. Moreira: Okay. Very, very good question, Paul. So those are costs that we had incurred several years ago when we were integrating EGMA. It is not NSTAR Gas. EGMA. And per the settlement agreement that we executed back when we acquired the company back in 2020, it did provide similar to what we have been granted in previous M&A transactions in all three jurisdictions, quite honestly. Okay? Those costs, those integration-related costs were incurred by the parent company as the source of funds. So those costs are at the parent company. We recorded the benefit at the parent company to reimburse the parent.\n\nThe recovery, the dollars will come in from EGMA customers, because the EGMA customers are the customers that are reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Nolan for closing remarks.\nJohn M. Moreira: Thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a solid execution of our business plan. Our team delivered top-tier reliability for our customers, we advanced major strategic priorities, we enhanced our financial condition, and we strengthened the foundation of the business. As we move into 2026, we are carrying that momentum forward with a clear focus on derisking our business profile, resolving the key open items ahead of us, and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth. We are firing on all cylinders to finish this work, and I am confident that the disciplined execution you have seen from us this year will continue as we deliver on the commitments we have made to our customers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

      "Content": "Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate\n\nRob Carpenter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:31 AM PST 12 min read\n\nThere’s an old saying in the “fake rich” world: you can rent the Bentley, rent the mansion, shoot the video, post the lifestyle, and for a little while, you can make people believe you’ve arrived. But there’s one thing most people can’t fake. A jet. It’s too expensive, too scrutinized, and too many people have to sign off before you get the keys.\n\nFor decades, insurance was trucking’s jet.\nYou could get a USDOT number for free. You could file a BOC-3 for a small amount. You could lease a truck for a thousand bucks a week and a trailer for less. You could fake a lot of things on the way in. But you could not fake your way past an underwriter. That was the one door in this industry that actually required you to prove something before it opened.\nWhen I started my own authority, I got put through the absolute ringer. Loss runs. MVRs. Operations questions. Safety management controls. Dispatch practices. Maintenance programs. Drug and alcohol testing. Driver qualification files. Someone actually wanted to know whether I had the business maturity and the risk controls to be trusted with 80,000 pounds next to families on I-95.\n\nThat gate has eroded. I think it’s time we talk about how to put it back.\nWhat The Front Door Used To Look Like Traditional insurance underwriting focused on screening risk. Before you could bind coverage and activate your authority, underwriters examined your operation. They reviewed your driver qualification process, MVR standards, drug and alcohol compliance, hours-of-service oversight, maintenance discipline, accident register, claims handling, organizational structure, and supervisory controls. That was the baseline.\nAt renewal, the process went even deeper. Agents and brokers assembled a full marketing package. They told your story. This is who they are. This is how they operate. This is how they manage risk. Here are the improvements they’ve made. They sold you to underwriters the way you’d sell a prospect to a captive group. That process enforced accountability, rewarded improvement, and created a natural barrier to entry that kept out those with no business operating 80,000-pound equipment on public highways.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it required the risk to prove itself before it received cheap access to the system.\nWhat The Front Door Looks Like Now Today, a growing slice of the market runs on self-attestation and instant-issue workflows. Especially the nefarious and poor performers. A new entrant goes online, self-declares a handful of details, who they are, what they have, how they operate, where they’re located, pays a premium, and walks away with a policy. No underwriter conversation. No document review. No verification of anything they just told you.\n\nStory Continues\nThat policy, paired with a $300 authority filing fee, a free USDOT number, and a $25 BOC-3, is enough to put a truck on the highway. The industry has moved toward connected and telematics-driven programs that can be activated quickly for new policyholders.\nI’m not anti-tech. I work with captives and insurers constantly. Innovation in underwriting is necessary and overdue. But when speed replaces verification at the entry point, we’re moving the risk test from the underwriting desk to the highway.\n\nThe public is funding that experiment.\nTiming Mismatch FMCSA’s New Entrant Safety Assurance Program was an important step forward. New carriers are supposed to receive a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation and are considered new entrants for 18 months. That program is designed to verify whether a carrier has the basic safety management controls in place to operate.\nBut the timing is the problem. Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door.

      "Content": "Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate\n\nRob Carpenter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:31 AM PST 12 min read\n\nThere’s an old saying in the “fake rich” world: you can rent the Bentley, rent the mansion, shoot the video, post the lifestyle, and for a little while, you can make people believe you’ve arrived. But there’s one thing most people can’t fake. A jet. It’s too expensive, too scrutinized, and too many people have to sign off before you get the keys.\n\nFor decades, insurance was trucking’s jet.\nYou could get a USDOT number for free. You could file a BOC-3 for a small amount. You could lease a truck for a thousand bucks a week and a trailer for less. You could fake a lot of things on the way in. But you could not fake your way past an underwriter. That was the one door in this industry that actually required you to prove something before it opened.\nWhen I started my own authority, I got put through the absolute ringer. Loss runs. MVRs. Operations questions. Safety management controls. Dispatch practices. Maintenance programs. Drug and alcohol testing. Driver qualification files. Someone actually wanted to know whether I had the business maturity and the risk controls to be trusted with 80,000 pounds next to families on I-95.\n\nThat gate has eroded. I think it’s time we talk about how to put it back.\nWhat The Front Door Used To Look Like Traditional insurance underwriting focused on screening risk. Before you could bind coverage and activate your authority, underwriters examined your operation. They reviewed your driver qualification process, MVR standards, drug and alcohol compliance, hours-of-service oversight, maintenance discipline, accident register, claims handling, organizational structure, and supervisory controls. That was the baseline.\nAt renewal, the process went even deeper. Agents and brokers assembled a full marketing package. They told your story. This is who they are. This is how they operate. This is how they manage risk. Here are the improvements they’ve made. They sold you to underwriters the way you’d sell a prospect to a captive group. That process enforced accountability, rewarded improvement, and created a natural barrier to entry that kept out those with no business operating 80,000-pound equipment on public highways.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it required the risk to prove itself before it received cheap access to the system.\nWhat The Front Door Looks Like Now Today, a growing slice of the market runs on self-attestation and instant-issue workflows. Especially the nefarious and poor performers. A new entrant goes online, self-declares a handful of details, who they are, what they have, how they operate, where they’re located, pays a premium, and walks away with a policy. No underwriter conversation. No document review. No verification of anything they just told you.\n\nStory Continues\nThat policy, paired with a $300 authority filing fee, a free USDOT number, and a $25 BOC-3, is enough to put a truck on the highway. The industry has moved toward connected and telematics-driven programs that can be activated quickly for new policyholders.\nI’m not anti-tech. I work with captives and insurers constantly. Innovation in underwriting is necessary and overdue. But when speed replaces verification at the entry point, we’re moving the risk test from the underwriting desk to the highway.\n\nThe public is funding that experiment.\nTiming Mismatch FMCSA’s New Entrant Safety Assurance Program was an important step forward. New carriers are supposed to receive a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation and are considered new entrants for 18 months. That program is designed to verify whether a carrier has the basic safety management controls in place to operate.\nBut the timing is the problem. Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers.

      "Content": "Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate\n\nRob Carpenter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:31 AM PST 12 min read\n\nThere’s an old saying in the “fake rich” world: you can rent the Bentley, rent the mansion, shoot the video, post the lifestyle, and for a little while, you can make people believe you’ve arrived. But there’s one thing most people can’t fake. A jet. It’s too expensive, too scrutinized, and too many people have to sign off before you get the keys.\n\nFor decades, insurance was trucking’s jet.\nYou could get a USDOT number for free. You could file a BOC-3 for a small amount. You could lease a truck for a thousand bucks a week and a trailer for less. You could fake a lot of things on the way in. But you could not fake your way past an underwriter. That was the one door in this industry that actually required you to prove something before it opened.\nWhen I started my own authority, I got put through the absolute ringer. Loss runs. MVRs. Operations questions. Safety management controls. Dispatch practices. Maintenance programs. Drug and alcohol testing. Driver qualification files. Someone actually wanted to know whether I had the business maturity and the risk controls to be trusted with 80,000 pounds next to families on I-95.\n\nThat gate has eroded. I think it’s time we talk about how to put it back.\nWhat The Front Door Used To Look Like Traditional insurance underwriting focused on screening risk. Before you could bind coverage and activate your authority, underwriters examined your operation. They reviewed your driver qualification process, MVR standards, drug and alcohol compliance, hours-of-service oversight, maintenance discipline, accident register, claims handling, organizational structure, and supervisory controls. That was the baseline.\nAt renewal, the process went even deeper. Agents and brokers assembled a full marketing package. They told your story. This is who they are. This is how they operate. This is how they manage risk. Here are the improvements they’ve made. They sold you to underwriters the way you’d sell a prospect to a captive group. That process enforced accountability, rewarded improvement, and created a natural barrier to entry that kept out those with no business operating 80,000-pound equipment on public highways.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it required the risk to prove itself before it received cheap access to the system.\nWhat The Front Door Looks Like Now Today, a growing slice of the market runs on self-attestation and instant-issue workflows. Especially the nefarious and poor performers. A new entrant goes online, self-declares a handful of details, who they are, what they have, how they operate, where they’re located, pays a premium, and walks away with a policy. No underwriter conversation. No document review. No verification of anything they just told you.\n\nStory Continues\nThat policy, paired with a $300 authority filing fee, a free USDOT number, and a $25 BOC-3, is enough to put a truck on the highway. The industry has moved toward connected and telematics-driven programs that can be activated quickly for new policyholders.\nI’m not anti-tech. I work with captives and insurers constantly. Innovation in underwriting is necessary and overdue. But when speed replaces verification at the entry point, we’re moving the risk test from the underwriting desk to the highway.\n\nThe public is funding that experiment.\nTiming Mismatch FMCSA’s New Entrant Safety Assurance Program was an important step forward. New carriers are supposed to receive a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation and are considered new entrants for 18 months. That program is designed to verify whether a carrier has the basic safety management controls in place to operate.\nBut the timing is the problem. Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Chameleons and bad actors have stolen millions in freight and burned their bridges; they’re often closed or off to the secret side entity before any new entrant can audit them.\n\nUnder the current structure, a carrier receives authority, begins operations, moves freight, hires drivers, and accumulates exposure on public roads for months before anyone assesses whether it has the infrastructure to do so safely. That’s backward. We’re essentially telling people: get on the road now, and we’ll take a closer look later.\nWe all know what happens in that gap. Carriers with weak controls, weak maintenance, weak hiring, weak oversight, or outright fraudulent operations rack up miles, violations, and sometimes tragedies before the system even sees them.\nThe enforcement bandwidth to close that gap doesn’t exist. I’m not throwing rocks at FMCSA investigators. They’re doing the job with the resources they’ve got. But the math is unforgiving. Federal and state partners conducted roughly 12,300 compliance reviews in 2024. That’s roughly 1.5 percent coverage of the active carrier population. We cannot physically audit our way out of this at the front door using only government headcount.\n\nSo the jet disappeared at the same time our ability to catch the worst actors early stayed flat.\nHow Do We Spend The Money We Do Have Before I lay out what I think we should do, I want to raise a question about what we’re already doing, because it matters.\nFMCSA has previously contracted pre-authority screening work. The Crash Preventability Determination Program, administered under the Volpe Center, is one example of the agency using outside resources to support safety determinations. That contract was competitively bid. I know, because I bid on it.\nWe were not selected. The contract was awarded to a company that quoted roughly one-quarter the rate for the same scope of work, tens of thousands of crash preventability determinations over two years, for approximately $400,000. There’s no way you can hire enough US citizens to do that many reviews objectively in two years and still meet federal wage guidelines. It’s a literal impossibility.\n\nThere are only two ways you do that volume of work at that price. You’re either outsourcing the labor or you’re running an AI model with limited context outside the parameters used to determine causation. Both of those are problematic. Crash preventability is not a bulk processing exercise. It requires an understanding of crash dynamics, regulatory context, carrier operations, and on-the-ground reality. If we’re making those determinations on the cheap, we need to ask what we’re getting for our money and whether the quality matches the stakes.\nI raise this not to relitigate a contract, but because it speaks directly to the broader problem: when we try to cut costs on safety verification, we tend to get what we pay for. If we’re going to build a front-door screening model for new entrants, it has to be grounded in legitimate expertise, not lowest-bid economics.\n\nMake Contextual, Pre-emptive Risk Control Great Again The answer isn’t shutting the door on new drivers or new businesses. The answer is making sure they’re actually ready before we hand them the keys to 80,000 pounds on a public highway. And we can do this without adding a single federal employee to the payroll.\nHere’s what I’m proposing, and it’s modeled on the exact process that works in the private insurance market every day. I know because I built one of the few fleet-exclusive risk control programs for captives and insurance providers.\nRaise the entry fee to fund the screening The current authority application cost is roughly $300. Let’s be honest: $300 is not a barrier to anything. That’s your rented Rolls-Royce. It’s enough to look the part, but not enough to prove you belong.\nIncrease it to $1,000. That’s still entirely accessible for any legitimate operator who is serious about starting a business. But it’s enough to filter out the undercapitalized, the unserious, and the opportunistic entries that clog the system and create risk for everyone else.\nA portion of that fee funds mandatory pre-authority risk-control screening. No new tax dollars. No additional appropriations. Those entering the system pay for verification that protects everyone already in it.\n\nThis is what we currently do for captive group member prospects. You don’t join a captive group as a member without a screening and proof that your risk profile is acceptable.\nRequire a pre-authority risk control assessment Before authority is activated, every applicant completes a standardized, off-site review of basic safety management controls. This is not a full compliance audit. This is a minimum viable control review, the same kind of assessment I perform for captive insurance groups when they’re deciding whether to admit a new member.\nThe review covers the fundamentals: driver qualification file process, drug and alcohol compliance program, hours-of-service oversight, preventive maintenance and inspection program, accident register and claims reporting, safety policies and supervisory structure, and proof of operational control. That last one matters more than people realize; it’s how you catch ghost leasing setups and paper operations before they ever touch a highway.\n\nOutcomes are straightforward. Approved. Conditional, with required corrections and a monitoring period. Or deferred, meaning the applicant has fundamental gaps that need to be addressed before they can operate. Authority activation is tied to completing this baseline verification.\nI built this exact system for my own practice because I’m a one-person team, and I still assess thousands of fleets a year for captive groups and insurers nationwide. It’s an electronic intake with standardized questions, required document uploads, automated routing into a backend system with alerts and scoring, cross-checks against FMCSA safety history, and a clear outcome with reasons and corrective actions. It’s not magic. Its structure. And it scales.\nKeep the existing new entrant audit, and make it better Nothing in this proposal eliminates the 12- to 18-month new-entrant audit. It stays. But its role changes. Instead of being the first meaningful contact between FMCSA and a new carrier, it becomes a validation checkpoint. The carrier has already been screened. The fundamentals have already been verified. Now the audit confirms whether the carrier is actually doing what they said they’d do.\nThat’s a much more efficient use of limited enforcement resources. You’re not starting from zero with every carrier you walk into. You have a baseline. You have documents. You have a score. You know what to look for.\n\nMonthly risk monitoring after the authority This is the other half of the solution, and it’s where the system goes from reactive to preventive.\nEvery new entrant receives a monthly risk profile scorecard. What changed in your FMCSA profile this month? Violations. Crashes. BASIC indicator movements. ISS trends. Maintenance patterns. Paired with corrective recommendations. DataQs guidance where needed. Coaching triggers when patterns emerge.\nThis isn’t punitive. This isn’t enforcement, this is a review. This is the same service I provide to my captive and insurer clients right now. A monthly report card that says: here’s what changed, here’s what it means, here’s what to check in your program, and here’s how to fix it. It turns the system from one that punishes failure after the fact into one that catches drift early and gives carriers the tools to correct it.\n\nWho Does The Work This is where the scalability lives. You don’t need to hire thousands of new federal employees. You contract with accredited, fleet-focused risk control professionals who already exist and already do this work in the private market and have done it for years.\nI work for roughly 200 insurance groups, from large captives down to small regional insurers, agents, and brokers. The risk control professionals supporting this market understand FMCSRs, loss drivers, crash dynamics, and operational realities. We’re not generalists. We’re not industrial hygienists who got handed a fleet account. We are specialists who can assess a carrier’s operations and determine whether the risk profile is acceptable.\n\nA vetted pool of these professionals, operating under standardized protocols and a standardized intake and scoring methodology, could process the volume of new-entrant applications without straining government headcount. The infrastructure exists. The expertise exists. The technology to automate and scale the intake exists. What’s missing is the decision to use it.\nWhy It Matters Trucking is not a private club. But it is a shared-risk ecosystem. Whether we like it or not, this industry operates like a captive group. The losses are shared across insurance markets, courtrooms, enforcement actions, and communities. Every nuclear verdict, every preventable fatality, every chameleon carrier that slips through the cracks, we all pay for it. In premiums. In public trust. In regulatory backlash. And in families that never make it home.\nIn any captive, admission standards matter. You don’t let a high-risk member into the pool without verifying that they meet the group’s minimum expectations, because everyone else bears the cost when you get it wrong.\n\nThat’s the principle we’ve lost at the entry point. That’s the principle we need to restore.\nI’m writing this as both an article and a proposal. The framework I’ve described here is not theoretical. It’s operational. We run a version of this system every day for the private insurance market, and it works. It scales. It catches what needs to be caught. It does it without requiring a single additional government hire.\nThis is a conversation worth having. The current entry model was built for a different era, when insurance underwriting provided the scrutiny that the application process didn’t. That scrutiny has diminished in parts of the market. The application cost hasn’t changed meaningfully. The enforcement infrastructure can’t address both gaps simultaneously.\n\nA user-funded, pre-authority risk control screening model is cost-neutral to taxpayers, scalable through existing private-sector expertise, and aligned with how risk is already evaluated in the markets that insure these carriers. It doesn’t replace anything FMCSA already does. It adds a layer of verification at the one point in the process where it matters most: before the truck hits the road.\nThe goal isn’t to make entry impossible. The goal is to make entry responsible.\nA modest increase in the cost of authority, paired with a standardized pre-authority risk-control review and ongoing monthly monitoring, rebuilds a modern version of the gate that insurance once provided. One that uses today’s technology and today’s data, but restores yesterday’s discipline.\nWe don’t need more paperwork. We need a smarter front door. Once we protect the door, we have an entire other team to clean up what’s already inside.\nInsurance used to be that door.\nIt can be built again if we choose to.\nThe post Trucking Risk Control Could Become the New Entrant Gate appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

As you know, you know, we have the S&P 500 pegged at at 7600 by the end of the year. That that has not changed. But one of the risks that we highlighted in our 2026 outlook was what we termed the dark side of AI. Everybody want to talk, wants to talk about just the the the benefits and how it's going to be a change for good and that we absolutely buy into that. But you have to look at the other side. and we really see that dark side playing out in in in two ways. One,\n00:59 Tim\nwhat is the impact going to look like on the labor market? How big of a spike in unemployment are we actually going to see with layoffs that are triggered by AI. Right now those have been contained. The mass layoffs that we've seen recently, only about 15% of those have been related to AI.\n01:21 Tim\nThe the other piece of this is what other industries are they going to disrupt margins and even the entire industry altogether. And I think that's what you're seeing in the software stock space right now when we have a category that just not too long ago, Brian, these stocks were trading at about a 35X multiple. Now they're down below 20. You're down 20% plus this year. That's a significant sell-off. That's the dark side of AI. And we need to pay attention to that because I I do think there's going to be other industries that are disrupted and this is certainly a threat.\n02:05 Tim\nUh and even if it doesn't isn't a threat that plays out this year, it's something investors need to prepare for and watch out for volatility in their portfolios because it's going to scare investors. It's going to scare investors, so we need to be prepared for that. It's not just going to be up and to the right, uh, like like uh, some people hope.\n02:26 Brian\nTim, are we in a dark period yet for software stocks despite them falling uh aggressively or is that just I enter a room and the lights have been dimmed a little bit and we're about ready to get full on dark?\n02:40 Tim\nI don't I I I I would agree with you, Brian. I don't necessarily think the bottom is in here. I I do think we could fall further and and that's just you look at where margins are. I mean, margins are through the roof in this category of stocks. Those haven't come down yet. Um and valuations still are, you know, you know, pretty pretty elevated. So, they've come down. I think it's a better entry point, but but I I would be in your camp that I wouldn't call a bottom in this uh this category quite yet.\n03:10 Brian\nAnj, weigh in.\n03:13 Anj\nYeah, look, um, like what Tim is saying, I we may not have not see a bottom because investors are taking note of what's happening with the cost of coding, which is going down, uh with the disruption concerns. and it's not just in software, it's now in transportation and logistics, it's in wealth management. I mean, what area is not going to be disrupted by AI? And so I think that this is what the market is starting to sniff out. Oh, you mean that there's now going to be a disruption in these business models?\n03:55 Anj\nBecause you can have a startup that comes up and says, look, well, I can do this for you at a 10th of the cost of what you are getting from one of these bigger companies. So, this is um, sort of disruption in real time that you're seeing and with this uh with this what we saw yesterday with the pullback, although you don't want to call it a pullback. um but not.\n04:22 Brian\nAnj, don't tell me. Anj, I'm cutting you off right there. Don't even tell me. Don't tell me there's a pullback. Come on.\n04:26 Anj\nThe crash, the crash.\n04:29 Brian\nThere we go Anj, thank you.\n04:30 Anj\nLook, as as you saw tech that was going down yesterday and these in logistics and transportation companies that were down double digits, etc. you were looking at Walmart that was that just closed at an all-time high yesterday. So, certainly investors are going fully defensive here as they see what's happening. And by the way, there was this uh this uh tweet that was going out, this uh Substack this week also that was talking about the impact of AI. All of this is feeding into what is this going to do to these traditional companies, these big these tech companies that have high margins? What is this going to do to their business models?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oh, you mean that there's now going to be a disruption in these business models?\n03:55 Anj\nBecause you can have a startup that comes up and says, look, well, I can do this for you at a 10th of the cost of what you are getting from one of these bigger companies. So, this is um, sort of disruption in real time that you're seeing and with this uh with this what we saw yesterday with the pullback, although you don't want to call it a pullback. um but not.\n04:22 Brian\nAnj, don't tell me. Anj, I'm cutting you off right there. Don't even tell me. Don't tell me there's a pullback. Come on.\n04:26 Anj\nThe crash, the crash.\n04:29 Brian\nThere we go Anj, thank you.\n04:30 Anj\nLook, as as you saw tech that was going down yesterday and these in logistics and transportation companies that were down double digits, etc. you were looking at Walmart that was that just closed at an all-time high yesterday. So, certainly investors are going fully defensive here as they see what's happening. And by the way, there was this uh this uh tweet that was going out, this uh Substack this week also that was talking about the impact of AI. All of this is feeding into what is this going to do to these traditional companies, these big these tech companies that have high margins? What is this going to do to their business models?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

As you know, you know, we have the S&P 500 pegged at at 7600 by the end of the year. That that has not changed. But one of the risks that we highlighted in our 2026 outlook was what we termed the dark side of AI. Everybody want to talk, wants to talk about just the the the benefits and how it's going to be a change for good and that we absolutely buy into that. But you have to look at the other side. and we really see that dark side playing out in in in two ways. One,\n00:59 Tim\nwhat is the impact going to look like on the labor market? How big of a spike in unemployment are we actually going to see with layoffs that are triggered by AI. Right now those have been contained. The mass layoffs that we've seen recently, only about 15% of those have been related to AI.\n01:21 Tim\nThe the other piece of this is what other industries are they going to disrupt margins and even the entire industry altogether. And I think that's what you're seeing in the software stock space right now when we have a category that just not too long ago, Brian, these stocks were trading at about a 35X multiple. Now they're down below 20. You're down 20% plus this year. That's a significant sell-off. That's the dark side of AI. And we need to pay attention to that because I I do think there's going to be other industries that are disrupted and this is certainly a threat.\n02:05 Tim\nUh and even if it doesn't isn't a threat that plays out this year, it's something investors need to prepare for and watch out for volatility in their portfolios because it's going to scare investors. It's going to scare investors, so we need to be prepared for that. It's not just going to be up and to the right, uh, like like uh, some people hope.\n02:26 Brian\nTim, are we in a dark period yet for software stocks despite them falling uh aggressively or is that just I enter a room and the lights have been dimmed a little bit and we're about ready to get full on dark?\n02:40 Tim\nI don't I I I I would agree with you, Brian. I don't necessarily think the bottom is in here. I I do think we could fall further and and that's just you look at where margins are. I mean, margins are through the roof in this category of stocks. Those haven't come down yet. Um and valuations still are, you know, you know, pretty pretty elevated. So, they've come down. I think it's a better entry point, but but I I would be in your camp that I wouldn't call a bottom in this uh this category quite yet.\n03:10 Brian\nAnj, weigh in.\n03:13 Anj\nYeah, look, um, like what Tim is saying, I we may not have not see a bottom because investors are taking note of what's happening with the cost of coding, which is going down, uh with the disruption concerns. and it's not just in software, it's now in transportation and logistics, it's in wealth management.

      "Content": "The city where free buses changed everything\n\nPeter Yeung for Reasons to be Cheerful\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:30 AM PST 9 min read\n\nThe city where free buses changed everything The open-air central bus station in Dunkirk, France, feels like a Formula 1 pit lane. In the space of a few minutes, a dozen pink, green and blue buses speed in and out, with passengers descending and mounting through all available doors. The arrivals board, displaying destinations such as Grande-Synthe, Cappelle-la-Grande and Malo-les-Bains, ticks over so quickly it’s as if drivers are vying for a podium spot.\nAs the C4 bus pulls in, a teenage girl with chunky headphones and a mother with a baby in a stroller are among those to board. But there are no beeps registering cards, nor the clink of coins used to pay for tickets. Because in this northern French city, no passenger pays.\n“It’s not bad, really not bad,” says Theo, a 23-year-old gardener in the city and a daily user of the service, in typical French understatement. “You never have to wait long. There’s less car traffic and less pollution because of it. And it’s free,” Theo tells Reasons to be Cheerful .\n\nIn 2014, Dunkirk made the decision to get on board with free public transit. Mayor Patrice Vergriete, who has a doctorate in urban planning, pledged during his election campaign that the city would become the largest in France to drop fares on local networks. Today about 150 vehicles — labeled “100% free bus, 7 days a week” — crisscross the city and its surroundings, giving 200,000 residents free access to 18 routes.\n\n“We made this decision to prioritize freedom [for residents] and really create a shock to improve mobility in Dunkirk,” says Jean-François Montagne, the deputy mayor of Dunkirk and head of the region’s ecological transition efforts.\nProponents like Montagne say that making public transit free reduces carbon emissions, air pollution and traffic, and supports low-income households. They also argue that a funding model that relies on government subsidy rather than passenger fares is more resilient in the face of shocks like pandemics. But critics say that there are high costs linked to these policies — and that scaling them up to sprawling metropolitan hubs, just as New York City’s new Mayor Zohran Mamdani has pledged to do, is unlikely to be a smooth ride.\n\nIn Dunkirk, it took four years — from 2014 to 2018 — for efforts to hit the road. First, authorities publicized the program in the media and on the streets, carried out surveys with residents, simplified and reworked timetables, improved the quality of vehicles, repositioned bus stops and increased the size of the fleet. In 2015, they launched free travel on weekends as a testing period, before rolling out the service seven days a week in September 2018.\n\nStory Continues\n“You can’t just make buses free from one day to the next,” says Montagne. “If the service is underused, timetables not well understood, if buses are always late, and you don’t change people’s views of public transit, then it won’t work.”\nCentral to Dunkirk’s strategy was reinventing the image of public buses, which were typically seen as overloaded, unclean and not particularly safe. Authorities now clean buses every day, and if a seat is broken, then it is replaced within a day. Each route, they decided, should have a scheduled arrival every 10 minutes. Smartphone applications also allow passengers to track where and how full their bus is.\n\n“These might seem like small details, but we worked a lot on this,” says Montagne.\nAnd just over a decade since Dunkirk kick-started its free bus program, the policy has hit top gear. According to Dunkirk city hall, the number of bus passengers has increased by 165% since the initiative was introduced.\n“In Dunkirk, it’s led to a huge rise in users, it’s revitalized the city and it works as a kind of social redistribution,” says Maxime Huré, a lecturer in political sciences at France’s University of Perpignan Via Domitia who has studied the program.\n\nA 2019 study by the Observatory of Free Transport Cities, an independent body, found that the policy has led to residents making more trips to the city center, that about half of the new bus riders were taking bus journeys they previously made by car, and that the attractiveness and image of the city has improved.\n\nSeparate research in 2021 found that free buses are helping young people in Dunkirk shift away from the “idealized” image of private car ownership. Indeed, according to Montagne, city hall figures show that 10% of Dunkirk bus users have abandoned their cars since 2018, cutting use of city parking lots by 30%.\nMonique, a 75-year-old retiree, stopped driving two years ago with her weakening eyesight and the ease of the free bus transport as an alternative. She’s pleased that there’s even a standalone night service akin to a city-run Uber service that can be ordered on demand at 10 p.m., taking her directly home for just 2 euros when she goes to the theater.\n“I think it’s really super, it’s very well serviced,” she says.\nIn France, where the transportation sector accounts for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions, a growing number of authorities are getting on board with free public transit. Today more than 45 local authorities have made some form of public transport free for all passengers, including Aubagne, Compiègne and Montpellier. In the latter, where the policy applies only to permanent residents, bus ridership increased by 27% in just one year and the number of people being overexposed to nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant linked to road traffic, fell by 90%.\n\nAnd while Dunkirk has introduced completely free transit, others have adopted other models, such as age-based criteria — in Lille and Strasbourg, for example, bus travel is free for those under 18. Free weekend travel, meanwhile, is offered for everyone in Nantes, Rouen and Nancy.\nBut France is far from the only nation to have introduced free public transit.\nAccording to a 2025 report by Italian researchers, fare-free public transit has been rolled out in 100 places across the world, notably in the U.S., Brazil and European countries such as Poland. Estonia’s capital Tallinn introduced free transit to its 450,000 residents in 2013, and Luxembourg became the first nation in the world where all public transportation is free (except for first class on trains) in 2020.\n\nSome of the oldest examples of fare elimination trace back to the U.S. The California city of Commerce pioneered free buses in 1962 . A 1974 federal law provided $40 million for pilots in Denver and Trenton, New Jersey . More recently, Iowa City eliminated bus fares in August 2023 — paid for with a 1% increase in utility taxes and doubling most public parking rates. The two-year pilot led to ridership exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 18% , with emissions dropping by 778 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.\nYet opinions are divided on whether a major city like Paris, London or indeed New York City could successfully implement a fare-free model.\nSome critics say that free transport systems lead to loss of public income and divert money away from infrastructure upgrades.\n\nA report published in September 2025 by France’s Court of Auditors found that free public transport in smaller cities led to ridership increases at a limited cost, but in larger, already well-used networks, the introduction of free transit is “very costly” because it is accompanied by significant losses in fare revenue and additional costs related to the necessary reinforcement of the existing network, which is under greater strain.\nThe report found that, in Montpellier, free public transport has primarily led to a surge in short trips, more at the expense of walking and cycling than driving. In Lyon, in contrast, where public transit fares have increased — to 90 euros (about $105) for a monthly subscription — the additional funds have made it possible to finance a wider range of transport services and reduce car traffic.\n\nBut Dunkirk authorities defend the scheme. Montagne says the 17 million euro (roughly $19.9 million) annual cost — out of the city’s 500 million euro annual budget — for running the free buses is an important social investment. “The money serves the population, it helps workers, but also families, for leisure, to attend healthcare.”\n“[The Court of Auditors] claim that it devalues the service, but it’s totally the opposite — we have fewer crimes and issues than before.”\nSurveys during Dunkirk’s 2020 municipal elections even found that 99% of respondents ranked the free bus service as the most important public policy.\nHuré argues that, given the percentage of transit network income that passenger fares represent is broadly falling, making buses free is far less radical than it seems: Fare revenue has been declining almost universally. “But politically, it’s presented as a rupture,” he says.\n\nBut whether free buses can work elsewhere depends on other factors such as the capacity of networks to deal with an increase in passengers and funding sources, according to Huré. In France, public transit systems are already partly funded by the versement mobilité , or mobility levy, which relies on a percentage of social security contributions paid by French employers.\n“It could work in large cities, but it depends on the context,” he says.\nThe road ahead appears to show even more places treating buses and mobility as a public good and not a paid privilege. On Jan. 1 of this year, buses and regional trains became free across France’s Lens-Liévin, Hénin-Carvin and Béthune-Bruay metropolitan areas, making it the largest fare-free public transport network in France. Perhaps New York Mayor Mamdani, whose city already sees 1.4 million bus journeys a day , could take the trend to the next level.\n“There is strong demand for free transit,” says Huré, “and I believe it will continue.”\nThis story was produced by Reasons to be Cheerful and reviewed and distributed by Stacker .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The arrivals board, displaying destinations such as Grande-Synthe, Cappelle-la-Grande and Malo-les-Bains, ticks over so quickly it’s as if drivers are vying for a podium spot.\nAs the C4 bus pulls in, a teenage girl with chunky headphones and a mother with a baby in a stroller are among those to board. But there are no beeps registering cards, nor the clink of coins used to pay for tickets. Because in this northern French city, no passenger pays.\n“It’s not bad, really not bad,” says Theo, a 23-year-old gardener in the city and a daily user of the service, in typical French understatement. “You never have to wait long. There’s less car traffic and less pollution because of it. And it’s free,” Theo tells Reasons to be Cheerful .\n\nIn 2014, Dunkirk made the decision to get on board with free public transit. Mayor Patrice Vergriete, who has a doctorate in urban planning, pledged during his election campaign that the city would become the largest in France to drop fares on local networks. Today about 150 vehicles — labeled “100% free bus, 7 days a week” — crisscross the city and its surroundings, giving 200,000 residents free access to 18 routes.\n\n“We made this decision to prioritize freedom [for residents] and really create a shock to improve mobility in Dunkirk,” says Jean-François Montagne, the deputy mayor of Dunkirk and head of the region’s ecological transition efforts.\nProponents like Montagne say that making public transit free reduces carbon emissions, air pollution and traffic, and supports low-income households. They also argue that a funding model that relies on government subsidy rather than passenger fares is more resilient in the face of shocks like pandemics. But critics say that there are high costs linked to these policies — and that scaling them up to sprawling metropolitan hubs, just as New York City’s new Mayor Zohran Mamdani has pledged to do, is unlikely to be a smooth ride.\n\nIn Dunkirk, it took four years — from 2014 to 2018 — for efforts to hit the road. First, authorities publicized the program in the media and on the streets, carried out surveys with residents, simplified and reworked timetables, improved the quality of vehicles, repositioned bus stops and increased the size of the fleet. In 2015, they launched free travel on weekends as a testing period, before rolling out the service seven days a week in September 2018.\n\nStory Continues\n“You can’t just make buses free from one day to the next,” says Montagne. “If the service is underused, timetables not well understood, if buses are always late, and you don’t change people’s views of public transit, then it won’t work.”\nCentral to Dunkirk’s strategy was reinventing the image of public buses, which were typically seen as overloaded, unclean and not particularly safe. Authorities now clean buses every day, and if a seat is broken, then it is replaced within a day. Each route, they decided, should have a scheduled arrival every 10 minutes. Smartphone applications also allow passengers to track where and how full their bus is.\n\n“These might seem like small details, but we worked a lot on this,” says Montagne.\nAnd just over a decade since Dunkirk kick-started its free bus program, the policy has hit top gear. According to Dunkirk city hall, the number of bus passengers has increased by 165% since the initiative was introduced.\n“In Dunkirk, it’s led to a huge rise in users, it’s revitalized the city and it works as a kind of social redistribution,” says Maxime Huré, a lecturer in political sciences at France’s University of Perpignan Via Domitia who has studied the program.\n\nA 2019 study by the Observatory of Free Transport Cities, an independent body, found that the policy has led to residents making more trips to the city center, that about half of the new bus riders were taking bus journeys they previously made by car, and that the attractiveness and image of the city has improved.\n\nSeparate research in 2021 found that free buses are helping young people in Dunkirk shift away from the “idealized” image of private car ownership. Indeed, according to Montagne, city hall figures show that 10% of Dunkirk bus users have abandoned their cars since 2018, cutting use of city parking lots by 30%.\nMonique, a 75-year-old retiree, stopped driving two years ago with her weakening eyesight and the ease of the free bus transport as an alternative. She’s pleased that there’s even a standalone night service akin to a city-run Uber service that can be ordered on demand at 10 p.m., taking her directly home for just 2 euros when she goes to the theater.\n“I think it’s really super, it’s very well serviced,” she says.\nIn France, where the transportation sector accounts for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions, a growing number of authorities are getting on board with free public transit. Today more than 45 local authorities have made some form of public transport free for all passengers, including Aubagne, Compiègne and Montpellier. In the latter, where the policy applies only to permanent residents, bus ridership increased by 27% in just one year and the number of people being overexposed to nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant linked to road traffic, fell by 90%.\n\nAnd while Dunkirk has introduced completely free transit, others have adopted other models, such as age-based criteria — in Lille and Strasbourg, for example, bus travel is free for those under 18. Free weekend travel, meanwhile, is offered for everyone in Nantes, Rouen and Nancy.\nBut France is far from the only nation to have introduced free public transit.\nAccording to a 2025 report by Italian researchers, fare-free public transit has been rolled out in 100 places across the world, notably in the U.S., Brazil and European countries such as Poland. Estonia’s capital Tallinn introduced free transit to its 450,000 residents in 2013, and Luxembourg became the first nation in the world where all public transportation is free (except for first class on trains) in 2020.\n\nSome of the oldest examples of fare elimination trace back to the U.S. The California city of Commerce pioneered free buses in 1962 . A 1974 federal law provided $40 million for pilots in Denver and Trenton, New Jersey . More recently, Iowa City eliminated bus fares in August 2023 — paid for with a 1% increase in utility taxes and doubling most public parking rates. The two-year pilot led to ridership exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 18% , with emissions dropping by 778 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.\nYet opinions are divided on whether a major city like Paris, London or indeed New York City could successfully implement a fare-free model.\nSome critics say that free transport systems lead to loss of public income and divert money away from infrastructure upgrades.\n\nA report published in September 2025 by France’s Court of Auditors found that free public transport in smaller cities led to ridership increases at a limited cost, but in larger, already well-used networks, the introduction of free transit is “very costly” because it is accompanied by significant losses in fare revenue and additional costs related to the necessary reinforcement of the existing network, which is under greater strain.\nThe report found that, in Montpellier, free public transport has primarily led to a surge in short trips, more at the expense of walking and cycling than driving. In Lyon, in contrast, where public transit fares have increased — to 90 euros (about $105) for a monthly subscription — the additional funds have made it possible to finance a wider range of transport services and reduce car traffic.\n\nBut Dunkirk authorities defend the scheme. Montagne says the 17 million euro (roughly $19.9 million) annual cost — out of the city’s 500 million euro annual budget — for running the free buses is an important social investment. “The money serves the population, it helps workers, but also families, for leisure, to attend healthcare.”\n“[The Court of Auditors] claim that it devalues the service, but it’s totally the opposite — we have fewer crimes and issues than before.”\nSurveys during Dunkirk’s 2020 municipal elections even found that 99% of respondents ranked the free bus service as the most important public policy.\nHuré argues that, given the percentage of transit network income that passenger fares represent is broadly falling, making buses free is far less radical than it seems: Fare revenue has been declining almost universally. “But politically, it’s presented as a rupture,” he says.\n\nBut whether free buses can work elsewhere depends on other factors such as the capacity of networks to deal with an increase in passengers and funding sources, according to Huré. In France, public transit systems are already partly funded by the versement mobilité , or mobility levy, which relies on a percentage of social security contributions paid by French employers.\n“It could work in large cities, but it depends on the context,” he says.\nThe road ahead appears to show even more places treating buses and mobility as a public good and not a paid privilege. On Jan. 1 of this year, buses and regional trains became free across France’s Lens-Liévin, Hénin-Carvin and Béthune-Bruay metropolitan areas, making it the largest fare-free public transport network in France. Perhaps New York Mayor Mamdani, whose city already sees 1.4 million bus journeys a day , could take the trend to the next level.\n“There is strong demand for free transit,” says Huré, “and I believe it will continue.”\nThis story was produced by Reasons to be Cheerful and reviewed and distributed by Stacker .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Closer Look at Retirement Plan Managed Accounts\n\nJeffrey H. Snyder\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nBroadcast Retirement Network's Jeffrey Snyder discusses managed account marketing versus research with Ronald Smith, FSA.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWell, Ron, it is so great to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nGood morning, Jeff, and it's a pleasure to be here.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nYeah, and I'm really excited to talk about this. We have talked on the network about managed accounts. You've done some deep diving, deep dive on managed accounts, done a lot of research.\nWhat are some of the key takeaways from your research?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nWell, managed accounts is a large and growing business segment of all DC record keepers. People have different and strong opinions on both sides. People like the concept of personalization, improved retirement outcomes, and the skeptics talk about the cost of the program and whether there are more cost-effective ways to accomplish basically the same goals.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nI know personalization, sorry to interrupt you, personalization is such a big trend in our business these days and everyone's looking for an opportunity to personalize what the end user, that participant receives. Sorry to interrupt, go ahead and continue your thought.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think to a large degree, the DC industry is a commodity. And so wherever the business can show value and differentiation, they're looking to do that. And personalization is one of those topics getting a lot of attention today.\nIn some of my prior corporate lives, I've often been asked to research pitch books or new product innovations with a skeptical eye. Even when you take into account managed account fees and Morningstar assumed 40 basis points in their research, which is pretty reasonable assumption. Even when you take fees into account, you are provided with favorable outcomes really across all ages, all incomes, all types of DC planned designs.\nAnd whether you are a target date fund investor or what they call a do-it-yourself investor. So it sounded too good to be true and that's when I started looking into things. And whenever I read someone else's research, I'm always focused for statements that raise questions.\nSo I started digging in and I said, I'd really like to know just how big a role increased contributions play. Is it 51% or is it 90%? And they didn't specify that.\n\nStory Continues\nSo that makes me a little curious. And then the second part is improved asset allocations with not a whole lot of improvement if you are a target date investor, but more improvement if you're a do-it-yourself investor across all age segments, at least 25% of the population are 0% invested in equities, which is not a very favorable comment on the DC industry. If that many participants are that conservatively invested for what should be a long-term savings goal.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWe've been talking, not to interrupt you, but we've been talking about it for a long time, people investing in money markets, stable value, maybe they're investing in a bond fund. When you're 30 years old, as you know, and probably the audience knows, you want to take advantage of the growth in markets. I mean, compared to what's going on today in the Dow and the S&P 500 , it just lights out.\nSo that makes a lot of sense. And let me just ask you, Ron, I mean, look, when you read research, you got to read it with an eye. And I'm not saying there's not a, I don't think people are looking to mislead.\nI think that at the end of the day, they're looking to create research that supports their thesis. We see this in lots of industry related research, right? I mean, people try to prove, kind of work back and they use the research almost as quasi marketing.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYes. And anyone, I remember as a kid, he had flyer sneakers helped you jump fences until you actually try to jump a fence, then it was not a favorable outcome. So people have been spinning and I'm taking credit for the term spin search, where research and marketing kind of overlap with one another.\nTo give you an example, Morningstar says that the biggest benefits go to younger, newly hired people. And I said to myself, gee, if I was trying to pitch more managed accounts as a QDIA or as a hybrid that maybe kicks in at 50, I would sure like to be telling people that everyone benefits under all plan designs.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nBut let me ask you, what are some of the takeaways? Say I'm the fiduciary, say I'm the investment advisor on the plan. I'm the fiduciary of the plan.\n\nI'm on the committee. What are some of the key takeaways here? Do I need to do more due diligence?\nBecause a lot of times managed accounts are just kind of a bolt on. They just say, during the RFP process, during the selection process, the advisor sometimes doesn't even look at it. So is the takeaway here, do a lot more due diligence, whether it's Morningstar or Financial Engines, one or the other litany of products that are out there?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think the question in my mind is the squeeze worth the juice. And there is a Prudential study that has talked about plan sponsor reluctance to implement managed account until the fees get below 10 basis points. That's the example that people use.\n\nAnd so I think plan sponsors intuitively know that it is an expensive service for what it gives. What it gives is promoting increased savings. And record keepers have been promoting increased savings for decades for free.\nSo you don't have to pay 40 basis points a year for what should be a nudge early on in someone's career, maybe periodic nudges. The other thing is more diversified portfolios. If you're in a target date fund, you are in a pretty well diversified portfolio.\nIt's really the do-it-yourselfers and particularly the very conservatively invested participant who would greatly benefit from diversity. Record keepers have been doing that through the education process for decades as well. The fact that so many people are 0% invested in equity shows that they're not doing a great job.\n\nBut I think there is an ROI for managed accounts. And it's not been publicized because managed accounts are sold as kind of a squishy benefit. Participants, they're going to get better retirement outcomes.\nThey're going to feel better. They're going to feel more confident. But I'm an actuary.\nI'm a numbers guy. And I'm looking for the numbers. So where I would like to see things go, and I think consultants certainly have this capability, is to make a measure of the ROI of putting in managed accounts.\nCompare it to the ROI of an expanded education program, a personalized education program for either low savers or poorly diversified people. Stack that up against what managed accounts offers.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\n\nWell, Ron, it sounds to me like a lot more due diligence is needed. You're going to continue research. Hopefully, you'll be able to come back on the network and we'll talk more about it.\nBut I think the takeaway here is that more due diligence may be needed. Ron, we're going to have to leave it there. Great to see you as always.\nThanks for joining us. And we look forward to having you back on the program again very soon, sir.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nThanks so much, Jeff, for having me. And hope your readers, your listeners got some good benefit out of this.\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 13, 2026, where it first appeared in the Retirement section.

      "Content": "A Closer Look at Retirement Plan Managed Accounts\n\nJeffrey H. Snyder\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nBroadcast Retirement Network's Jeffrey Snyder discusses managed account marketing versus research with Ronald Smith, FSA.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWell, Ron, it is so great to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nGood morning, Jeff, and it's a pleasure to be here.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nYeah, and I'm really excited to talk about this. We have talked on the network about managed accounts. You've done some deep diving, deep dive on managed accounts, done a lot of research.\nWhat are some of the key takeaways from your research?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nWell, managed accounts is a large and growing business segment of all DC record keepers. People have different and strong opinions on both sides. People like the concept of personalization, improved retirement outcomes, and the skeptics talk about the cost of the program and whether there are more cost-effective ways to accomplish basically the same goals.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nI know personalization, sorry to interrupt you, personalization is such a big trend in our business these days and everyone's looking for an opportunity to personalize what the end user, that participant receives. Sorry to interrupt, go ahead and continue your thought.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think to a large degree, the DC industry is a commodity. And so wherever the business can show value and differentiation, they're looking to do that. And personalization is one of those topics getting a lot of attention today.\nIn some of my prior corporate lives, I've often been asked to research pitch books or new product innovations with a skeptical eye. Even when you take into account managed account fees and Morningstar assumed 40 basis points in their research, which is pretty reasonable assumption. Even when you take fees into account, you are provided with favorable outcomes really across all ages, all incomes, all types of DC planned designs.\nAnd whether you are a target date fund investor or what they call a do-it-yourself investor. So it sounded too good to be true and that's when I started looking into things. And whenever I read someone else's research, I'm always focused for statements that raise questions.\nSo I started digging in and I said, I'd really like to know just how big a role increased contributions play. Is it 51% or is it 90%? And they didn't specify that.\n\nStory Continues\nSo that makes me a little curious. And then the second part is improved asset allocations with not a whole lot of improvement if you are a target date investor, but more improvement if you're a do-it-yourself investor across all age segments, at least 25% of the population are 0% invested in equities, which is not a very favorable comment on the DC industry. If that many participants are that conservatively invested for what should be a long-term savings goal.\n\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nWe've been talking, not to interrupt you, but we've been talking about it for a long time, people investing in money markets, stable value, maybe they're investing in a bond fund. When you're 30 years old, as you know, and probably the audience knows, you want to take advantage of the growth in markets. I mean, compared to what's going on today in the Dow and the S&P 500 , it just lights out.\nSo that makes a lot of sense. And let me just ask you, Ron, I mean, look, when you read research, you got to read it with an eye. And I'm not saying there's not a, I don't think people are looking to mislead.\nI think that at the end of the day, they're looking to create research that supports their thesis. We see this in lots of industry related research, right? I mean, people try to prove, kind of work back and they use the research almost as quasi marketing.\n\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYes. And anyone, I remember as a kid, he had flyer sneakers helped you jump fences until you actually try to jump a fence, then it was not a favorable outcome. So people have been spinning and I'm taking credit for the term spin search, where research and marketing kind of overlap with one another.\nTo give you an example, Morningstar says that the biggest benefits go to younger, newly hired people. And I said to myself, gee, if I was trying to pitch more managed accounts as a QDIA or as a hybrid that maybe kicks in at 50, I would sure like to be telling people that everyone benefits under all plan designs.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\nBut let me ask you, what are some of the takeaways? Say I'm the fiduciary, say I'm the investment advisor on the plan. I'm the fiduciary of the plan.\n\nI'm on the committee. What are some of the key takeaways here? Do I need to do more due diligence?\nBecause a lot of times managed accounts are just kind of a bolt on. They just say, during the RFP process, during the selection process, the advisor sometimes doesn't even look at it. So is the takeaway here, do a lot more due diligence, whether it's Morningstar or Financial Engines, one or the other litany of products that are out there?\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nYeah, I think the question in my mind is the squeeze worth the juice. And there is a Prudential study that has talked about plan sponsor reluctance to implement managed account until the fees get below 10 basis points. That's the example that people use.\n\nAnd so I think plan sponsors intuitively know that it is an expensive service for what it gives. What it gives is promoting increased savings. And record keepers have been promoting increased savings for decades for free.\nSo you don't have to pay 40 basis points a year for what should be a nudge early on in someone's career, maybe periodic nudges. The other thing is more diversified portfolios. If you're in a target date fund, you are in a pretty well diversified portfolio.\nIt's really the do-it-yourselfers and particularly the very conservatively invested participant who would greatly benefit from diversity. Record keepers have been doing that through the education process for decades as well. The fact that so many people are 0% invested in equity shows that they're not doing a great job.\n\nBut I think there is an ROI for managed accounts. And it's not been publicized because managed accounts are sold as kind of a squishy benefit. Participants, they're going to get better retirement outcomes.\nThey're going to feel better. They're going to feel more confident. But I'm an actuary.\nI'm a numbers guy. And I'm looking for the numbers. So where I would like to see things go, and I think consultants certainly have this capability, is to make a measure of the ROI of putting in managed accounts.\nCompare it to the ROI of an expanded education program, a personalized education program for either low savers or poorly diversified people. Stack that up against what managed accounts offers.\nJeffrey Snyder, Broadcast Retirement Network\n\nWell, Ron, it sounds to me like a lot more due diligence is needed. You're going to continue research. Hopefully, you'll be able to come back on the network and we'll talk more about it.\nBut I think the takeaway here is that more due diligence may be needed. Ron, we're going to have to leave it there. Great to see you as always.\nThanks for joining us. And we look forward to having you back on the program again very soon, sir.\nRonald Smith, FSA, Retired Retirement Industry Member\nThanks so much, Jeff, for having me.

      "Content": "ETFs to Gain as US & Taiwan Sign Trade Deal to Reduce Tariffs to 15%\n\nAparajita Dutta\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:17 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: FLTW\n\nHNHAF\n\nHNHPF\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nThe landmark trade agreement signed between the United States and Taiwan on Feb. 12, 2026, has ignited a new wave of optimism for the island&rsquo;s industrial powerhouses. By reducing reciprocal tariffs from 20% to 15%, the deal directly lowers the cost of entry for Taiwanese high-tech exports &mdash; particularly semiconductors, generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts &mdash; into the world&rsquo;s largest economy.\n\nThis reduction effectively places Taiwan on a \"fair footing\" with other Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, removing the competitive disadvantage previously caused by \"Trump-era\" reciprocal duties.\nFor investors, this pivotal deal creates a significant tailwind for Taiwanese giants like Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and, by extension, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold heavy concentrations of them, as these companies remain poised for margin expansion and increased shipment volumes in the days ahead.\nBy holding a diversified basket of these firms, ETFs offer a direct route to capitalize on this improved competitive landscape without the risk of picking individual stocks.\nBefore suggesting these ETFs for your portfolio, let us delve a little deeper into the specifics of this trade deal and the prospects for Taiwanese companies, so you can make a more informed investment decision.\n\nUS-Taiwan: The Evolving Geopolitics of a Strategic Partnership The U.S.-Taiwan relationship is far from simple, operating within a complex geopolitical framework.\nAs the United States steadily pushes for a &ldquo;Silicon Shield&rdquo; by reshoring 40% of the semiconductor supply chain to its shores, Taiwan leverages its dominance in AI hardware to secure more favorable trade terms.\nAgainst this backdrop, the agreement effectively codifies the mutual dependency between the two nations, with the United States lowering trade barriers in exchange for Taiwan deepening its critical technology investments in America.\n\nThe deal includes an $84 billion commitment from Taiwan to purchase U.S. goods &mdash; including LNG, crude oil and aircraft &mdash; between 2025 and 2029, along with a $250 billion investment pledge by Taiwanese firms into U.S. manufacturing. Taiwan has also pledged to remove or reduce 99% of tariff barriers on U.S. goods, as well as provide &ldquo;preferential market access&rdquo; for U.S. exports, including autos, beef products and minerals (as per a CNBC press release).\nThis \"reciprocal trade\" framework, while aimed at narrowing the U.S. trade deficit, will add impetus to the booming Taiwanese economy by fueling the insatiable global demand for AI.\n\nStory Continues\nETFs to Gain Bolstered by this deal, Taiwan&rsquo;s economy, which grew 8.6% in 2025, is expected to maintain its momentum despite global \"AI bubble\" fears. According to Fortune, this growth was largely fueled by a 78% surge in exports to the United States, backed by ballooning AI demand.\nNow that the tariff is reduced, more export volumes are expected to be registered this year, which should help Taiwanese \"enablers\" capture efficiency gains in the coming days.\nAgainst this backdrop, for those looking to capitalize on this transformation, the following ETFs offer the most direct exposure:\n\niShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EWT\nThis fund, with net assets worth $8.15 billion, offers exposure to 88 large and mid-sized companies in Taiwan. Its top three holdings include TSM (24.66%), Mediatek (4.72%) and Hon Hai Precision Industry HNHPF (4.56%).\nEWT has surged 37.5% over the past year. The fund charges 59 basis points (bps) as fees. It traded at a good volume of 6.98 million shares in the last trading session.\nFranklin FTSE Taiwan ETF FLTW\nThis fund, with net assets worth $706.3 million, offers exposure to 130 Taiwan large and mid-capitalization stocks. Its top three holdings include TSM (22.09%), HNHPF (6.35%) and Mediatek (6.25%).\nFLTW has soared 46.2% over the past year. The fund charges 19 bps as fees. It traded at a volume of 0.49 million shares in the last trading session.\n\nFidelity Emerging Markets Multifactor ETF FDEM\nThis fund, with net assets worth $448.1 million, offers exposure to 250 stocks of large and mid-capitalization emerging markets companies that have attractive valuations, high quality profiles, positive momentum signals, lower volatility than the broader emerging markets equity market, and lower correlation to the U.S. equity market. TSM holds the first position in this fund, with 10.30% weightage.\nFDEM has gained 30.6% over the past year. The fund charges 28 bps as fees.

ASML stock has also outperformed its peers, namely Lam Research LRCX and KLA Corporation KLAC, while underperforming Applied Materials AMAT in the same time frame.\nASML One-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShares of Lam Research, KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have returned 10.8%, 1.1% and 19.1%, respectively. This surge in stock price has also made ASML stock overvalued.

      "Content": "Alphabet Juggles EU Scrutiny, Worker Unrest And Century Bond AI Bet\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:12 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNever miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\nEuropean regulators have opened a fresh antitrust probe into Google’s search advertising pricing practices, focusing on how ad auctions are run and priced.\nAlphabet is facing internal unrest as employees protest AI partnerships and raise concerns about contracts with government and immigration enforcement agencies.\nThe company has issued a rare 100 year bond and is committing large capital to AI infrastructure, drawing attention to the long term risk and reward profile of these investments.\n\nAlphabet, NasdaqGS:GOOGL, is in the spotlight as regulators, employees and credit markets all focus on very different parts of the business at the same time. The stock trades at about $309.0, with a return of 67.5% over the past year and 230.0% over three years, which puts recent moves against a backdrop of strong multi year performance. That context matters as investors weigh how much these new pressures could influence sentiment and valuation.\nFor you as a shareholder or potential investor, the key question is how Alphabet balances regulatory compliance, workforce concerns and heavy AI spending. The rare 100 year bond and record capital expenditures indicate a very long term commitment to AI, while the EU probe and employee pushback highlight legal and reputational risks that could shape how the company executes on those plans.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Alphabet by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Alphabet.\nIs Alphabet's balance sheet strong enough for future acquisitions? Dive into our detailed financial health analysis.\nAlphabet’s latest bond deals show how aggressively it is using long dated debt to fund its AI build out rather than relying only on its cash pile. The company has just sold a mix of dollar, sterling and Swiss franc senior unsecured notes, including a rare 100 year £1b bond paying a 6.125% coupon, alongside shorter maturities in 2026, 2029, 2031, 2033, 2046 and 2056 with coupons between 3.70% and 5.75%. With more than $20b raised across currencies and tenors, Alphabet is materially extending the duration of its liabilities while locking in fixed rates. For you, the key questions are how this extra interest burden and very long commitment interact with heavy 2026 capital expenditure guidance of $175b to $185b and ongoing shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. The strong demand reported for the century bond signals credit markets are comfortable with Alphabet’s balance sheet and cash generation today, but it also increases the importance of disciplined AI infrastructure spending and clear monetisation, especially while Google faces EU antitrust scrutiny on search advertising pricing and internal pushback over certain AI and government contracts.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Alphabet Narrative The large, multi currency bond issuance directly supports the narrative’s AI infrastructure catalyst, giving Alphabet funding capacity to scale data centers, custom chips and cloud services globally.\nThe step up in long term debt and interest costs could pressure margins if revenue growth or AI monetisation do not match the higher capital intensity highlighted as a risk in the narrative.\nThe century bond and European offerings extend Alphabet’s funding horizon far beyond what the narrative discusses, so the potential long run impact of this leverage on flexibility and capital allocation is not fully captured.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Alphabet to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Century long and other long dated bonds increase Alphabet’s fixed obligations, so if AI driven projects underperform expectations, debt servicing could weigh more heavily on future cash flows.\n⚠️ The fresh EU antitrust probe into search ad pricing, together with employee protests about AI and government work, could affect the regulatory and reputational backdrop for the ad and AI businesses that underpin debt repayment.\n🎁 Locking in fixed coupons across maturities up to 2126 gives Alphabet predictable funding costs and preserves flexibility to keep investing in AI infrastructure even if credit markets tighten later.\n🎁 Strong investor appetite for the bonds suggests lenders view Alphabet’s earnings base and balance sheet as resilient, which may support future access to capital compared with peers like Microsoft and Amazon that are also ramping AI spending.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track how Alphabet’s net debt and interest expense trend relative to operating cash flow as the AI capex ramp plays through, and whether the mix of short and ultra long bonds keeps leverage at a level you are comfortable with. Watch for updates on AI driven revenue from Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud, since these engines are expected to carry the return on this new debt. Regulatory outcomes from the EU probe into search ad auctions, and any changes to Alphabet’s AI partnerships or government contracts in response to worker pressure, will also shape how sustainable its higher capital intensity looks over time.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Alphabet, head to the community page for Alphabet to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Should Altria Stock Be Part of Your Portfolio Post Q4 Earnings?\n\nSwati Prasad\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 7:06 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MO\n\nBTAFF\n\nBTI\n\nTPB\n\n^GSPC\n\nAltria Group, Inc. MO delivered a resilient fourth-quarter 2025 performance, highlighting the durability of its business model despite persistent cigarette volume declines and regulatory uncertainty. The company continued to lean on pricing power, disciplined cost management and strategic investment in smoke-free alternatives to protect margins and sustain earnings growth.\n\nImportantly, investor sentiment turned notably positive following the release. Since reporting fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29, 2026, Altria’s shares have climbed 12%, signaling renewed confidence in its earnings stability and capital return story.\n\nOver the past three months, Altria’s shares have gained 15.9%, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, which advanced 12.1%, and significantly exceeding the S&P 500’s 3.7% rise. The broader Zacks Tobacco industry performed slightly better with 16.6% growth during the same period.\n\nAmong peers, performance was mixed but generally stronger, with Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB surging 31.9%, Philip Morris International Inc. PM climbing 21.8% and British American Tobacco p.l.c. BTI rising 11.3%. Although Altria did not lead the group, the solid double-digit gain and post-earnings rally reflect improving investor confidence in its defensive business model and income-oriented appeal.\n\nAltria’s Three Months Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA closer look at the fourth-quarter results provides further insight into the drivers behind the stock’s recent strength.\nMO’s Q4 Earnings: Stability Amid Structural Headwinds Altria’s fourth-quarter results reflected steady execution in a challenging operating environment. Continued cigarette shipment declines weighed on revenues, but pricing actions and tight expense controls helped offset volume pressure. Adjusted earnings remained flat year over year at $1.30, due to reduced adjusted tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, offset by lower adjusted operating companies income (“OCI”). However, net revenues slipped 2.1% to $5.8 billion (down 0.5% net of excise taxes), primarily due to lower net revenues in the smokeable products segment.\n\nWithin this backdrop, the Smokeable Products segment continued to anchor overall profitability. Although domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell 7.9% in the quarter (down 10% for 2025), earnings resilience remained evident. Fourth-quarter adjusted OCI decreased 2.4% to $2.64 billion, with margins holding strong at 60.4%. For 2025, adjusted OCI increased 1.3% to $11.06 billion and margins expanded 1.8 percentage points to 63.4%. These results underscore Altria’s ability to counter structural volume declines through pricing power and productivity initiatives, preserving robust cash generation despite persistent industry headwinds.\n\nThe Oral Tobacco Products segment also remained an important contributor, though near-term investments weighed modestly on quarterly results. Fourth-quarter adjusted OCI declined 4.6% to $440 million, with margins at 64.5%. However, 2025 adjusted OCI rose 1.3% to $1.84 billion, with margins holding firm at 67.9%. Growth in the modern oral portfolio was led by on!, whose shipment volumes increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter to 44.2 million cans and 10.9% for 2025 to 177.8 million cans. With nicotine pouches now accounting for more than half of the total oral category, Altria continues to position its smoke-free portfolio as a key long-term growth pillar while leveraging the traditional businesses to fund the transition.\n\nStory Continues\nMO Continues Robust Cash Returns in Q4 Altria reaffirmed its commitment to delivering consistent shareholder value during the fourth quarter. In 2025, the company paid $7 billion in dividends, including $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter alone, reflecting the strength of its cash-generation capabilities.\n\nIn addition, share repurchases remained a key pillar of capital returns. During the fourth quarter, Altria repurchased 4.8 million shares for $288 million. For the full year, the company bought back 17.1 million shares for approximately $1 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2025, $1 billion remained under MO’s existing $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which extends through the end of 2026, providing continued flexibility to return capital to its shareholders.\n\nWhat to Expect From Altria in 2026? Management’s 2026 guidance reflects cautious but steady confidence in the business. Altria expects 2026 adjusted EPS in the range of $5.56 to $5.72, representing growth of 2.5% to 5.5% from a base of $5.42 in 2025. Growth is anticipated to be weighted toward the second half of the year, supported by a progressive increase in cigarette import and export activity.\n\nThe outlook assumes continued pricing strength and cost discipline, along with planned investments in contract manufacturing capabilities and smoke-free products. Management also expects 2026 capital expenditures of $300 million to $375 million.\n\nIs MO Stock’s Discounted Valuation Good? Altria is currently trading at a notable discount compared with industry peers and the broader market, making it an appealing option for value-focused investors. MO trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.98X, which is significantly lower than the industry average of 16.07X and the S&P 500’s average of 22.9X.\n\nBy comparison, peers such as Philip Morris and Turning Point Brands trade at much higher multiples of 22.39X and 31.65X, respectively, while British American Tobacco also trades slightly above Altria at 12.51X.\n\nMO P/E Ratio (Forward 12 Months)\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestor Takeaway for MO Altria's post-earnings rally indicates that investors are increasingly recognizing the company’s consistent execution, resilient margins and dependable cash-return framework. Despite ongoing structural cigarette volume declines, Altria continues to offset pressure through pricing strength, disciplined cost management and investment in smoke-free products. The stock’s discounted valuation, attractive dividend yield and steady cash flows enhance its appeal for long-term, income-oriented investors.\n\nAt the same time, relatively modest earnings growth expectations suggest limited upside. Given the recent run-up and balanced risk-reward profile, the stock appears fairly valued at current levels, supporting a hold stance until clearer signs of sustained growth momentum emerge.\n\nAt present, Altria carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The startup’s core tech is its Command family of generative AI models, which Cohere says are efficient enough to be deployed on limited GPUs — an attractive promise for enterprises looking to get a handle on cost and resource management.\nLast summer, Cohere launched North , a higher-level enterprise platform and AI workspace for secure, custom AI agents and workflows built on Cohere’s models.\nCohere’s CEO Aidan Gomez said last October that the startup may IPO “soon.” If “soon” means in 2026, Cohere may be contending against OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX/xAI, which are all reportedly weighing their own public debuts.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Cohere for comment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

That is what happened when a 21-year-old caller challenged a \" Ramsey Show \" host on a question investors argue about endlessly: index funds or mutual funds.\nThe caller, Matt, was not new to investing. He said he had been investing since he was 15 and now puts away about 25% to 30% of his income while earning between $80,000 and $90,000 a year. That adds up to roughly $18,000 annually, a number that immediately caught host George Kamel 's attention.\n\n\"You're going to be a multi-millionaire regardless of this conversation that happens next,\" Kamel said.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nPut professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.\nThe Debate That Never Really Ends Matt's question was straightforward. Why does Dave Ramsey's team favor mutual funds when many investors argue index funds are the smarter long-term choice?\nThe hosts laid out the difference in simple terms. Index funds follow a set list of companies and move with the market. Mutual funds are actively managed, meaning professionals select investments in an attempt to outperform the market.\nKamel summed up the tradeoff clearly. \"Your index funds won't beat the market because it represents the market.\"\n\nMatt pushed back with a common argument among younger investors. \"I know 80% of mutual funds don't beat the market.\"\nThat claim reflects a broader debate that has shaped modern investing. Independent scorecards such as the S&P Dow Jones Indices SPIVA reports have consistently shown that while active funds can outperform over shorter periods, a large majority fall behind comparable index benchmarks over longer stretches, particularly over 10-year and 20-year horizons. Analysts often point to higher fees as a key reason, since even small annual costs compound over time.\nTrending: Designed for investors with strong market convictions, REX Shares builds ETFs for income, leverage, and tactical positioning — explore the lineup.\n\nKamel responded by referencing research showing that 57% of actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds outperformed index funds over a 12-month period in 2023. Matt questioned the timeframe, asking why a single year mattered more than decades of performance, highlighting a core tension in the debate. Short-term results and long-term averages often tell different stories.\n\nStory Continues\nThe hosts made clear they were not anti-index fund. They said there is a place for both, with index funds often favored in taxable brokerage accounts because of lower turnover, while mutual funds are commonly used in retirement accounts where tax efficiency works differently.\nThe Real Point Was Never The Fund Type The conversation shifted when Matt raised another concern. If a mutual fund's success depends on a manager, what happens when that manager eventually changes?\nThe hosts acknowledged that turnover happens but argued investors should focus on long-term track records and consistent principles rather than individual personalities. Kamel compared it to supporting a sports team, saying success depends on culture and philosophy over time, not a single player.\nBut the most direct message came at the end of the conversation, when the debate itself stopped mattering.\n\n\"The key is your savings rate,\" Kamel said. \"That's what's holding people back from having money. It's not the discussion of index versus mutual.\"\nHe added a final takeaway aimed at listeners who get stuck trying to pick the perfect strategy. \"Just freaking invest.

      "Content": "The Only 3 Vanguard ETFs You Need for the Next 30 Years\n\nVandita Jadeja\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:56 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: VFFSX\n\nVFIAX\n\nVFINX\n\nVOO\n\nVITSX\n\nQuick Read All three Vanguard ETFs charge expense ratios of 0.03% to 0.04%.\nVOO delivered 100.86% cumulative returns over five years tracking the S&P 500.\nVYM has paid dividends without interruption for 19 years since its 2006 launch.\nRead: If you follow markets closely, Kalshi lets you profit directly from being right about what comes next.\nInvestors often overthink when it comes to building a long-term investment portfolio. With multiple sectors, companies, investment options, and alternatives, they tend to chase returns and forget about the long-term investment growth. Whether you’re a newbie or close to your retirement, if long-term investment is your goal, consider investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhile it is possible to generate impressive returns through individual stocks, an ETF will give you a basket of stocks at a low cost. This will reduce risk and ensure steady returns. You’d be surprised at the wealth-generation potential of the top ETFs. There are hundreds of ETFs available today, but Vanguard stands out as one of the top performers. It offers a range of ETFs ideal for every investor type and risk profile. But if you’re investing for the next 30 years, here are only 3 Vanguard ETFs you need. Here’s a look at them.\nVanguard S&P 500 One of the top Vanguard ETFs, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( NYSEARCA:VOO ) tracks the S&P 500 large-cap stock index. It mimics the performance of the index and offers broad diversification. It holds about 500 stocks across different business sectors and offers exposure to them.\nVOO has a yield of 1.08% and an expense ratio of 0.03%. The fund offers high growth potential by investing in the top U.S. blue chip stocks. Whether it is technology, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, financials, industrials, or utilities, you get multi-sector stock exposure.\n\nIt has generated a cumulative 1-year return of 16.39%, a 3-year return of 77.52%, and a 5-year return of 100.86%. VOO has the highest allocation to the technology sector (34.40%), followed by financials (13.40%) and communication services (10.60%). It includes companies that see earnings growth over time and have a good track record. The top 10 stock holdings include the Magnificent Seven, such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. If a business fails and is out of the S&P 500, you’ll not see it in the VOO ETF as well.\nVOO has a long-term focus and is a tried and tested index fund ideal for the next 30 years. It has low fees, and the annual dividend yield will more than make up for the fees. The fund has gained 14.70% in the year and is exchanging hands for $636.35 as of writing.\n\nStory Continues\nVanguard High Dividend Yield ETF Next on the list of Vanguard ETFs is the highly acclaimed Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF ( NYSEARCA:VYM ). It is a great choice for the long term. As the name suggests, the fund is known for steady passive income through dividends, and you won’t likely go wrong with it.\nIt tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index and invests in stocks that have a strong dividend history and high yield. VYM holds $88.5B in assets and was launched in 2006. It has maintained a 19-year uninterrupted payment history since inception.\n\nThe fund has an expense ratio of 0.04% and a yield of 2.34%. It has some overlap with the VOO but offers a higher yield. The fund invests in about 560 stocks with the highest allocation to the financial sector (21.90%), followed by technology (13.40%), industrials (13.20%), and healthcare (12.90%). It offers exposure to top-quality stocks like Procter & Gamble, Exxon Mobil, Broadcom, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart.\nIt has generated a cumulative 1-year return of 16.26%, 3-year returns of 47.65% and a 5-year return of 91.02%. VYM is ideal for investors who simply want to sit back and collect periodic payments. A combination of VOO and VYM could be a smart way to build wealth. The fund has gained 17.54% in the past year and is exchanging hands for $156.50.\nSince the fund spreads risk across hundreds of holdings, the dividend growth has remained slow in recent years. However, it doesn’t chase aggressive dividend growers and focuses on payment stability for the long term.\nVanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ( NYSEARCA:VTI ) works as a backbone for your long-term portfolio. It offers broad diversification and exposure to multiple sectors. The fund tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index and has an expense ratio of 0.03%.\nIt holds about 3,500 stocks and has a yield of 1.08%. Each company is weighted by the market cap, and as the economy grows, the portfolio grows with it. This allows investors to capture the market’s growth without worrying about fees. If you’re here for the long term, you’ll be able to enjoy steady growth.\n\nThe fund is tech-heavy with an allocation of 38.50% in the sector. This is followed by consumer discretionary (13.90%) and industrials (12.10%). Its top 10 holdings are tech-focused and include Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. The top three stocks, Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, make up 18% of the portfolio. Hence, the gains are amplified in a tech rally.\nVTI has generated a cumulative 1-year return of 15.44%, a 3-year return of 73.60%, and a 5-year return of 88.51%. If you’re looking for direct access to the overall stock market without picking individual stocks, VTI will do it for you. The fund has gained 14.30% in the past year and is exchanging hands for $341.47.\nTrade Outcomes, Not Opinions. Most investors are forced to guess how the market will react to news rather than trading the news itself. Kalshi flips that model by letting you trade directly on real world outcomes like interest rates, inflation prints, recessions, and the results are shocking.\nEach market is simple. You predict whether something will happen or not. If you are right, the contract pays out. Everyday people are printing money based on things they already know, and having a blast at the same time.",

The boost comes after the company’s fourth-quarter results and first-quarter forecasts, which KeyBanc defined as “strong”. Notably, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MPWR) has raised its 2026 Enterprise Data growth expectation from an earlier projection of 35% to more than 50%, though it considers this goal to be conservative.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, Inc.

      "Content": "Deutsche Bank Bullish on AppLovin (APP) After Sharp Pullback Following Project Genie Announcement\n\nSheryar Siddiq\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:54 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: APP\n\nGOOG\n\nAppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP ) ranks among the best high growth high margin stocks to buy now . Deutsche Bank stated on February 2 that it thinks AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP)’s risk-reward profile has “meaningfully improved” after a considerable stock selloff brought on by Google’s Project Genie announcement. The news raised investor worries about potential disruptions for game engine developers, platforms, and publishers, AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) being among them.\nAccording to Deutsche Bank analysts, Project Genie has the potential to streamline game development by serving as a “generative game engine,” enabling individuals with basic coding skills to create games and perhaps cutting development time for gaming companies.\nDespite market fears, Deutsche Bank believes it is “far too early” to predict how disruptive Genie could end up being. The firm anticipates that Genie will improve the game creation process and boost game content generation, which “should ultimately serve to enhance the advertising businesses for both Unity and Applovin.”\n\nAppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is a software-based advertising and app monetization company. It operates through two segments, Advertising and Apps. The company also develops and publishes free-to-play mobile games through its studios and partners.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On February 5, Goldman Sachs revised its Buy rating for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with a $250 price target. The firm anticipates a beat-and-raise quarter for the tech giant, citing strong industry supply/demand trends, though it admits that projections for outperformance have already become high.\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nGoldman Sachs believes that near-term stock price growth will be dependent on insight into 2027 revenue, as the upside potential for 2026 has already been built into the stock. The firm highlighted several possible catalysts for higher earnings in the first half of 2026, including sustained positive adjustments to hyperscaler capital expenditure through 2027 and growing trust in demand from unconventional clients like AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nAdditionally, Goldman Sachs emphasized that NVIDIA’s tech superiority might be strengthened by the impressive performance outcomes of new large language models trained on the company’s Blackwell architecture.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

All three major indexes ended in negative territory.\nHow Did The Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 1.3% or 669.42 points, to end at 49,451.\nThe S&P 500 slipped 1.6% to finish at 6,832.76 points. Tech, financials and communication services stocks were the worst performers.\nThe Information Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fell 2.6%. The Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) lost 2%. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) declined 1.8%. However, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) gained 1.5%, while the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) added 0.9%. Eight out of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 2%, or 469.32 points, to close at 22,597.15 points.\nThe fear gauge, CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), was up 17.96% to 20.82. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 2.74-1 ratio favored declining issues. A total of 22.45 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 20.78 billion.\nOn the NYSE, there were 748 new highs and 229 new lows. On the S&P 500, there were 99 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows.\nAI Fears Grip Markets Tech stocks have been taking a beating lately. Investors have been rotating out of tech stocks on growing concerns over the downsides of AI stocks. On Thursday, the selloff continued as fears grew over the potential of AI stocks compared to the billions of dollars pumped into the sector.\nSome sections of the stock market have suffered this year following the rollout of AI tools that threaten to copy what they do or eat into their profit margins. Financial stocks, especially, have been feeling the heat on concerns that AI could hamper wealth management businesses. Shares of Morgan Stanley ( MS ) declined 4.9% on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other sectors, such as transportation, logistics and real estate, also suffered due to the AI disruption fears. Shares of CBRE Group, Inc. ( CBRE ) plummeted 8.8%, while C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. ( CHRW ) tumbled 14.5%.\nInvestors&rsquo; sentiment was further dampened after Cisco Systems, Inc. ( CSCO ) issued weak guidance for the current year. Cisco&rsquo;s shares fell 12.3%. Currently, Cisco has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStory Continues\nAs fears over tech and AI stocks grew, investors took refuge in more defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities. Shares of The Coca-Cola Company ( KO ) ended the day 0.5% higher.\nInvestors are now looking forward to the key inflation report scheduled for release on Friday. The January consumer price index (CPI) report will give them a clearer idea of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s future monetary policy. A solid jobs report released earlier this week has already raised concerns that the Federal Reserve could delay its next rate cut.\n\nEconomic Data In economic data released on Thursday, the Labor Department said that jobless claims totaled 227,000 for the week ending Feb. 7, a decrease of 5,000 from the previous week&rsquo;s revised level of 232,000. The four-week moving average was 219,500, an increase of 7,000 from the previous week&rsquo;s revised average of 212,500.\nContinuing claims came in at 1,862,000, an increase of 21,000 from the previous week&rsquo;s revised level of 1,841,000. The 4-week moving average was 1,846,750, a decrease of 3,250 from the previous week's revised average of 1,850,000.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Pinterest downgraded, Airbnb upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe Fly\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:49 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nPINS\n\nTSMWF\n\nAMD\n\nDLTR\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm sees a \"compounding execution moat\" for the company in leading edge manufacturing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Pinterest downgraded, Airbnb upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe Fly\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:49 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nAVGO\n\nPINS\n\nRIVN\n\nROKU\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm sees a \"compounding execution moat\" for the company in leading edge manufacturing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Investor Bill Ackman Exits Chipotle Completely, Buys Meta Stock Instead\n\nEric Bleeker\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAMZN\n\nCMG\n\nNKE\n\nHTZ\n\nQuick Read Pershing Square sold Chipotle (CMG) and bought Meta (META) as Bill Ackman rotates from consumer discretionary into AI infrastructure.\nChipotle transactions declined 3.2% in Q4 with management guiding flat comparable sales growth for 2026.\nMeta is spending $115B to $135B in capex this year on AI infrastructure while revenue grew 24%.\nRead: If you follow markets closely, Kalshi lets you profit directly from being right about what comes next.\nBill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital made a significant portfolio shift, selling its entire stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill ( NYSE:CMG ) and taking a new position in Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), marking a rotation from consumer discretionary into AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Trade That Turned Heads Ackman's firm exited Chipotle along with positions in Nike ( NYSE:NKE ) and Hilton ( NYSE:HLT ), while simultaneously investing in Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ( NASDAQ:HTZ ).\nChipotle has been an Ackman favorite for years. But something changed. The stock is down 37% over the past year, and the business fundamentals tell a concerning story.\nWhy Dump Chipotle Now? Chipotle's Q4 2025 results revealed cracks in the foundation. Comparable restaurant sales dropped 2.5%, driven by a 3.2% decline in transactions. You can raise menu prices to offset cost inflation, but if customers stop walking through the door, you've got a traffic problem, not a pricing problem.\nOperating margins compressed to 14.1% from 14.6% the prior year. Management's 2026 guidance? Flat comparable sales growth. In other words, management isn't expecting things to get better anytime soon.\n\nCEO Scott Boatwright called 2025 \"a year of progress and resilience.\" But when you're guiding for zero comp growth and bleeding transactions, that's survival mode.\nThe stock trades at 33x trailing earnings. Wall Street projects earnings will drop from $1.17 in 2025 to $1.14 in 2026. Estimates once again rise to $1.37 in adjusted EPS in 2027, but there are few assurances this rebound will happen as consumers broadly turn away from fast casual concepts.\nFor a restaurant chain facing traffic headwinds, Ackman saw better opportunities elsewhere.\nWhy Meta Makes Sense Meta just reported Q4 2025 earnings that beat expectations. Revenue hit $59.89 billion, up 24% year-over-year. EPS came in at $8.88, crushing the $8.39 estimate. But the real story is what Meta is building.\nThe company is spending $115 billion to $135 billion in capex this year on AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg laid out the vision: \"I'm looking forward to advancing personal superintelligence for people around the world in 2026.\"\n\nStory Continues\nWhile operating margins declined to 41% from 48% due to infrastructure spending, this is investment, not deterioration. Ad impressions grew 18%, and average ad prices climbed 6%. The core advertising business is printing cash to fund the AI buildout.\nPerhaps most encouraging was Meta's guidance, which pointed to 33% revenue growth next quarter at the high-end. Yes, Meta will spend 2026 reinvesting almost all of its cash flow back into AI infrastructure, but the company is also demonstrating how much its utilizing AI investments to accelerate its core business.\n\nMeta trades at 28x trailing earnings with 24% revenue growth that could soon accelerate past 30%. Analysts have a target price of $860, implying 32% upside from current levels around $650.\nWhat It Means Ackman's move represents a rotation of capital from a mature restaurant chain facing structural headwinds into a technology company building AI infrastructure, funded by its advertising business. Don't ignore Ackman's move into other companies like Amazon as well.\nAmazon now trades for half the forward P/E of Walmart. It looks like Ackman's making a bet on leading AI companies that have sold off after massive capex plans in 2026. Yes, there is a risk these companies are overbuilding, but they're also at the lowest forward P/E levels they've traded at in recent years.\n\nPersonally, I like Ackman's bets. Amazon may face risks from its AI build, but I believe its logisitics network becomes even more valuable in an AI world, not to mention the potential margin expansion it can experience from robotics. As AWS growth accelerates into the high-20s by late 2026, my expectation is sentiment around Amazon will flip from today's lows.\n\nTrade Outcomes, Not Opinions. Most investors are forced to guess how the market will react to news rather than trading the news itself. Kalshi flips that model by letting you trade directly on real world outcomes like interest rates, inflation prints, recessions, and the results are shocking.\nEach market is simple. You predict whether something will happen or not. If you are right, the contract pays out. Everyday people are printing money based on things they already know, and having a blast at the same time.",

      "Content": "Rivian surges over 20% on delivery guidance, R2 launch in Q2; CEO says 'key inflection' reached The EV maker also posted a gross profit for Q4, driven by its software and services unit.\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nALI=F\n\nRivian ( RIVN ) stock surged on Friday morning after the EV-maker reported strong delivery guidance for the year, as it ramps up for the release of its R2 vehicle which the company said is on track for the second quarter of this year.\nThe company expects vehicle deliveries for 2026 in a range of 62,000 to 67,000 units, meeting Wall Street estimates of around 63,400 units and suggesting the upcoming R2 will boost sales.\nCrucially, the company said its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle is targeting customer deliveries for the second quarter, after early manufacturing validation builds rolled off the assembly line in January.\nRivian stock surged over 20% in early trade on Friday.\n\n\"This is for us a really key inflection here, where we're going to demonstrate the long term profitability of the business with R2, such an important program for us in terms of adding scale to business,\" CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nThat being said, Rivian sees its adjusted EBITDA loss for 2026 in a range of $1.80 billion to $2.10 billion versus a loss of $1.8 billion expected, with capital expenditures of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, meeting estimates of $2.05 billion.\n\n\"RIVN provided solid FY26 delivery guidance while providing EBITDA targets below the Street expectations as the company ramps its new and existing vehicle lines to generate stable revenue growth while investing strategically across the business,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients.\nAnd for a second quarter in a row, the company posted a gross profit of $120 million, broken down between a loss of $59 million for the automotive segment and a $179 million gain from software and services. Rivian said the jump in software and services profit is due to \"vehicle architecture and software development services\" stemming from its joint venture with Volkswagen ( VOW3.DE ).\nFor the year, Rivian's adjusted EBITDA loss came in at $2.063 billion, wider than estimates of $1.8 billion but within the company's forecast. Capital expenditures for the year hit $1.710 billion, versus estimates of $2.05 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents tallied $6.082 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, around $1 billion less than last quarter. Rivian said it had $6.588 million in total liquidity — crucial as it ramps up R2 production.\n\"We will be opportunistic with regards to additional capital raises,\" Scaringe said, adding that Rivian anticipates another $2 billion in cash and debt from its joint venture with Volkswagen this year.\n\nStory Continues\nRivian's big R2's ramp up is not without risks, however.\n\"The biggest risk in our ramp up, and what we've experienced in the past, and built some skills around managing, is just the complexities of ramping a supply chain, some of the unknowns within the supply chain, and that can be as specific as memory or chip set, or it could be as broad as aluminum supply,\" Scaringe said.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.286 billion versus $1.26 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, down around 27% from a year ago. Rivian attributed the revenue declines to the loss of regulatory emissions credit sales, the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, and lower average selling prices.\nThe company posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.59 versus $0.69 expected, with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $465 million versus $568.2 million expected.\nLast month, Rivian said it produced 10,974 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Ill., and delivered 9,745 vehicles in Q4, with full-year tallies of 42,284 vehicles produced and 42,247 vehicles delivered, reaching the midpoint of its guidance range of 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles delivered. However, Rivian’s original 2025 delivery target was between 46,000 and 51,000.\n\nAs part of the R2 product initiative, the company plans to amp up its AI and tech development, which investors are keen to hear more about.\nLast December, the company said software advancements from its new Autonomy platform and Large Driving Model (LDM), an autonomous model trained similarly to a large language model (LLM), will expand its Universal Hands-Free assisted driving to second-gen R1 vehicles, covering 3.5 million miles in the US.\nLater this year, a point-to-point hands-free system will be released, followed by a hands-free and eyes-free self-driving product, with the ultimate goal of achieving \"personal Level 4\" autonomy, meaning the vehicle will be able to drive fully on its own without requiring the driver's attention.",

      "Content": "Is AGNC Investment Stock a Millionaire Maker?\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:32 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AGNC\n\n^GSPC\n\nAGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC) has a huge 12.5% dividend yield right now. For comparison, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has a tiny 1.1% yield, and the average real estate investment trust (REIT) has a yield of 3.8%. But don't rush to buy shares thinking that you've found a no-brainer income opportunity. There's a lot more to understand here.\n\nWhat does AGNC Investment do? A traditional REIT generates income by leasing out physical properties. That's a pretty simple business model to understand, and it generally provides reliable cash flows to support yields well above market rates. AGNC Investment doesn't do this. It buys and sells bond-like securities created by pooling mortgages together. That's very different, with AGNC operating more like a bond mutual fund than a traditional REIT.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nThis changes the equation in an important way. While dividends are an important tool for AGNC Investment to return value to shareholders, management focuses on total return when evaluating the company's historical performance. Total return assumes that dividends are reinvested .\nMake sure you are the right kind of investor If you're a dividend investor trying to live off the income your portfolio generates, you will likely be disappointed by AGNC Investment. The dividend this REIT pays has been highly volatile over time and, in fact, has been trending lower for more than a decade. The stock price has followed the dividend down. That would have left investors with less income and less capital, which is probably not an ideal outcome for most dividend investors.\nHowever, if you reinvested the dividends AGNC Investment has paid since its initial public offering (IPO), the story is completely different. As the chart above shows, on a total return basis, AGNC Investment has beaten the S&P 500 index since its IPO. The returns don't line up with those of the S&P 500, suggesting that adding AGNC Investment to your portfolio could add a valuable diversification benefit, as well.\n\nAGNC isn't a great income stock, but it isn't a bad investment You have to keep your eyes focused clearly on your investment target when making financial decisions. If you are a dividend investor, AGNC Investment probably isn't a good fit. If you are focused on total return, however, this mortgage REIT could be just what you need to help you get to the millionaire plateau.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp. right now? Before you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp., consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AGNC Investment Corp. wasn’t one of them.

And its opportunity with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) is even bigger.\nThe company should be a big winner from Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) huge AI infrastructure spending surge, because Broadcom helps the leader in artificial intelligence make the tensor processing units (TPUs) that power its AI workloads. Meanwhile, Alphabet is beginning to let customers use TPUs for their own workloads through Google Cloud, and Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion order.\n\nOther hyperscalers are also turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, opening up an enormous growth opportunity over the next few years.\nAlphabet Alphabet is becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI. Its core Google Search revenue has accelerated with the introduction of new AI features, and its Gemini AI model has been recognized as among the best. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit has been on fire, with revenue surging 48% last quarter.\nThe company plans to spend big on AI infrastructure this year to capture the opportunity it is seeing. This is a good move, since its TPUs give it a big structural cost advantage over competitors, at less than half the price of Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company's decision to start letting customers deploy these chips within Google Cloud opens up another big revenue driver, with Morgan Stanley estimating that Alphabet has generated $13 billion in revenue for every 500,000 TPUs deployed. As the company with the most complete AI stack -- from its own custom chips to a leading AI model -- Alphabet is a stock to own for the next few years and beyond.\nMicron Technology One of the biggest bottlenecks in building AI infrastructure right now is memory. AI chips need to be packaged with high bandwidth memory (HBM) to optimize their performance, but the process to make HBM is complex and requires upward of three times the wafer capacity of ordinary DRAM (dynamic random-access memory). This has left the entire DRAM market in short supply and is leading to surging prices.\n\nStory Continues\nAs one of the three big DRAM makers -- along with South Korean companies SK Hynix and Samsung -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one of the best ways to play this dynamic. The current environment is leading to surging sales and huge gross margin increases.\nAnd with demand increasing rapidly, the current supply/demand situation for DRAM is likely to remain very tight over the next few years, despite Micron and others increasing capacity.

And its opportunity with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) is even bigger.\nThe company should be a big winner from Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) huge AI infrastructure spending surge, because Broadcom helps the leader in artificial intelligence make the tensor processing units (TPUs) that power its AI workloads. Meanwhile, Alphabet is beginning to let customers use TPUs for their own workloads through Google Cloud, and Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion order.\n\nOther hyperscalers are also turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, opening up an enormous growth opportunity over the next few years.\nAlphabet Alphabet is becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI. Its core Google Search revenue has accelerated with the introduction of new AI features, and its Gemini AI model has been recognized as among the best. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit has been on fire, with revenue surging 48% last quarter.\nThe company plans to spend big on AI infrastructure this year to capture the opportunity it is seeing. This is a good move, since its TPUs give it a big structural cost advantage over competitors, at less than half the price of Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company's decision to start letting customers deploy these chips within Google Cloud opens up another big revenue driver, with Morgan Stanley estimating that Alphabet has generated $13 billion in revenue for every 500,000 TPUs deployed. As the company with the most complete AI stack -- from its own custom chips to a leading AI model -- Alphabet is a stock to own for the next few years and beyond.\nMicron Technology One of the biggest bottlenecks in building AI infrastructure right now is memory. AI chips need to be packaged with high bandwidth memory (HBM) to optimize their performance, but the process to make HBM is complex and requires upward of three times the wafer capacity of ordinary DRAM (dynamic random-access memory). This has left the entire DRAM market in short supply and is leading to surging prices.\n\nStory Continues\nAs one of the three big DRAM makers -- along with South Korean companies SK Hynix and Samsung -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one of the best ways to play this dynamic. The current environment is leading to surging sales and huge gross margin increases.\nAnd with demand increasing rapidly, the current supply/demand situation for DRAM is likely to remain very tight over the next few years, despite Micron and others increasing capacity. That's an ideal situation for the company.\n\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?

      "Content": "Is It Worth Investing in Analog Devices (ADI) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAnalog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADI Check price target & stock forecast for Analog Devices here>>>\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ADI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $9.97.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "幹掉德國！台股市值衝全球第8 他揭台積電目標價喊「這代號」 三立新聞網\n2026年2月13日 週五 上午6:27\n\n政治中心／程正邦報導\n台股金蛇年以傲視全球的姿態完美封關！在最後一個交易日，台股不僅站上 33,605 點的歷史新高，總市值更一舉突破紀錄，擠下德國、躍升為全球第 8 大股市。隨著封關期間台美正式簽署 15% 關稅且不疊加的「232 最惠國待遇」，產業界與財經專家一致看好，金馬年開紅盤後，台股有望在「護國神山群」帶領下，衝向不設限的新高度。\n台灣經濟「G8」實力：人均 GDP 將突破 4 萬美金\n立委 王義川 在《新台派上線》節目中分析，台灣經濟目前的表現堪稱「史上最強」。台股市值站上世界第八，代表台灣實質影響力已進入全球頂尖梯隊。王義川驚嘆：「台灣的公司雖然沒那麼多，但整體市值排名竟然能幹掉德國，這是以前難以想像的事。」\n廣告\n廣告\n\n數據會說話，台灣 1 月出口額達 657.7 億美元，年增率高達 63.6%。王義川指出，這種開發中國家等級的 8% 以上 GDP 成長率，竟然發生在成熟經濟體的台灣身上，預計今年人均 GDP 將跨越 4 萬美金門檻。這也吸引了全球外資的高度關注，讓台股成為國際市場不可忽視的核心。\n\n關稅利多定心丸：七大工商團體罕見齊聲肯定\n除了基本面強悍，台美經貿談判也傳回捷報。美方拍板台美關稅 15% 且不疊加，並給予 232 最惠國待遇。此舉讓長期擔憂地緣政治影響出口的企業主放下心中大石。\n包括工總、工商協進會、中小企業總會等七大工商團體，在消息發布後第一時間便發出聯合聲明，高度肯定政府談判團隊在複雜政經環境下，爭取到與日、韓對手對齊的關稅水準。聲明中更特別喊話立法院，期盼朝野能加速審議相關議案，避免政治紛擾延宕產業競爭力，「老闆們眉開眼笑，代表員工的家庭也穩了。」\n財經專家謝晨彥：台股轉型「深碟」 目標價不設限\n財經專家謝晨彥回顧，去年 4 月關稅議題不明時，台股曾一度恐慌崩跌 7,000 點，讓出口商訂單全部 Pending（掛起）。如今利多底定，台股已從過去易受外資操控的「淺碟市場」，轉變為交易量穩定、深度廣度兼具的市場。\n謝晨彥分析，台股已不再只靠台積電「單一神山」，而是形成了「護國神山群」。去年 12 月外銷訂單貢獻九成來自資通訊與電子產品，背後是鴻海、緯創、日月光等 AI 伺服器與半導體鏈的集體爆發。他更幽默表示，去年只要「無腦投 0050」的投資人，收益幾乎是 100%。\n面對金馬年，謝晨彥大膽預測：「不要設限！」他認為台股平均交易量已達 6,000 億至 9,000 億元規模，吸引了全球主權基金與退休基金進駐，穩定性大幅提升。台積電在關稅與產能優勢下，目標價挑戰代號「2330」數字也並非不可能。\n更多三立新聞網報導\n國民黨受不了鄭麗文爆集體「退黨潮」 王義川諷：她想當中國人就去當\n王義川怒嗆《世紀血案》導演玩文字遊戲：不後續製作就公開燒掉\n韓國瑜稱過年見賴清德提「化解」建言 王義川樂見：助藍營放棄意氣之爭\n「銘揚首都」正式成軍！王義川帶領張銘祐、林子揚聯手登記投入初選",

      "Content": "US Adds Alibaba, BYD to List of Firms Aiding China’s Military\n\nMichael Shepard\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:09 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BABA\n\nBIDU\n\nBYDDF\n\nRBSTF\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Pentagon added Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. and BYD Co. to a list of companies that aid the Chinese military, a move that amounts to a US government warning for investors even though it carries no direct legal repercussions.\nThe high-profile inclusions risk straining President Donald Trump’s visit to China that’s set for April, especially given Alibaba’s prominence. Trump’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing is expected to include discussion about plans to export Nvidia Corp.’s H200 chips to China, and Alibaba is among the companies that could seek to get them.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMamdani’s Grocery Plan Takes Shape In Economic Policy Shift\nThe Best Tactics for Tackling Speeders\nNY Private School Startup Seeks Edge by Giving 42% Fee Discount\nNew York Faces Slippery Evening Commute as Storm Moves in Fast\nNew Zealand Net Migration Sinks to Lowest Level in More Than a Decade\nThe list also included RoboSense Technology Co. and wireless router maker TP-Link Technologies Co.\nAlibaba’s American depositary receipts shares fell as much as 5% in extended trading on Friday. Inclusion on the list could amount to a serious challenge for Alibaba, which is stepping up efforts to compete globally in artificial intelligence.\n“There’s no basis to conclude that Alibaba should be placed on the Section 1260H List,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy. We will take all available legal action against attempts to misrepresent our company.”\n\nBaidu’s receipts were down 4.5%. Spokespeople for Baidu didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular office hours.\nThe list, first published in 2021, now includes more than 130 entities accused of working with the Chinese military. The names include those of airlines, construction companies, shipping companies, computer hardware manufacturers and communications companies.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg had indicated in October that Alibaba, BYD, Robosense and other companies would be added to the list when he sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Bloomberg reported at the time.\nAn analysis by the law firm of Hogan and Lovells said inclusion on the 1260H List has “several direct and indirect implications,” including restrictions on US defense contracts, potential inclusion on other restricted party lists, reputational damage and increased compliance costs.\n--With assistance from Edwin Chan and Debby Wu.\n\nStory Continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

      "Content": "1 Growth Stock Down 32% to Buy Hand Over Fist in February, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: DDOG\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) developed an industry-leading cloud observability platform, which alerts businesses to technical issues with their digital infrastructure and sales channels before customers are negatively impacted.\nDatadog is now using its expertise in this field to help businesses deploy artificial intelligence (AI) software as effectively as possible. The products it has launched in this space so far are attracting significant demand, and it has even more in the pipeline. In fact, the company just reported its full-year operating results for 2025, and its revenue growth accelerated, partly thanks to its AI products.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nDatadog stock is trading almost 37% below its November 2025 record high, but Wall Street thinks this might be an opportunity. The majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given the stock a buy rating, and their consensus price target points to significant potential returns. Here's why their bullishness might be justified.\nDatadog's AI products are seeing significant demand In mid-2024, Datadog launched a product called LLM Observability, which helps developers track costs, uncover technical issues, and monitor the quality of the outputs of their large language models (LLMs). These models sit at the foundation of customer-facing AI software, so it is critical that they maintain the highest standard of quality.\nBut not every business has the financial or technical resources to build an LLM from scratch, so some of them adopt models from third-party developers like OpenAI as a shortcut. Datadog looks after these customers with a product called OpenAI Monitoring, which allows businesses to keep track of their usage, costs, response times, and error rates.\n\nBut Datadog isn't stopping there. It's gearing up to launch a series of new observability tools to track the usage and performance of AI agents and coding assistants, which could be extremely popular as more businesses and developers lean on these technologies to help improve their productivity.\nDatadog said 5,500 of its 32,700 customers were using at least one of its AI products at the end of 2025, which was up by a whopping 57% from the year-ago period. The company also said its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which is the bridge between Datadog observability data and customer AI models and software, saw a staggering 11-fold increase in requests compared to the third quarter just three months earlier. In simpler terms, usage of Datadog's AI integrations is exploding.\n\nStory Continues\nRevenue growth accelerated in 2025 Datadog generated $3.43 billion in total revenue during 2025, which was a 28% increase from the year before. It marked an acceleration from the 26% growth the company produced in 2024, and a lot of this momentum is attributable to AI customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter, for example, Datadog's revenue grew by 29% overall, but by 23% if you exclude AI-native customers (these are AI-first companies like OpenAI and Anthropic). That means this very small cohort of just 650 customers accounted for six percentage points of Datadog's total revenue growth for the period -- and this doesn't include the thousands of other customers that are also using the company's various AI tools.\n\nDatadog also had another strong year at the bottom line, bringing in $363.4 million in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income. That was up only marginally compared to 2024, mainly because the company spent aggressively in areas like research and development throughout the year to expand its AI product portfolio.\nWall Street is bullish on Datadog stock The Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts who cover Datadog stock, and 36 of them have given it a buy rating. Eight others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding, and just one recommends selling.\nThe analysts have an average share price target of $185.92, implying Datadog stock could climb by 47% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $260 suggests the stock could more than double instead.\nI think those targets are achievable if Datadog's revenue growth continues to accelerate, especially because its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7, which is near the cheapest valuation since it went public in 2019.\nLast year, Datadog valued its addressable market in the observability segment alone at $52 billion, and it expects that figure to grow by 9% per year through 2029. Based on the company's current revenue, it has barely scratched the surface of that opportunity. But remember, Datadog will soon launch entirely new products in this space for AI agents and coding assistants, which could expand the size of its observability opportunity even further than expected.\n\nAs a result, I think Wall Street analysts are right to be bullish on Datadog stock, especially at its current price.\nShould you buy stock in Datadog right now?

      "Content": "Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MRK\n\n^GSPC\n\nMerck (MRK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +7.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Merck is expected to post break-even earnings per share, indicating a change of -100% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -100% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -33.6%. This estimate has changed -36.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.98 indicates a change of +67.4% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $16.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.7%. The $66.6 billion and $70.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.4% and +6.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Merck reported revenues of $16.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5%. EPS of $2.04 for the same period compares with $1.72 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.33%. The EPS surprise was +0.49%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMerck is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 3.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account.

And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.37 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. This estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.3 indicates a change of +7.6% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7%. The $71.25 billion and $74.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.5% and +4.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History IBM reported revenues of $19.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $4.52 for the same period compares with $3.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.53%.

      "Content": "As Cisco Unveils a New AI Networking Chip, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold CSCO Stock?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CSCO\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) just released an artificial intelligence (AI) networking chip that could reshape how the world's biggest data centers handle AI workloads. The Silicon One G300 delivers 102.4 terabits per second of switching capacity.\nThat's more than double what the previous generation could handle. The chip powers new systems designed specifically for massive AI clusters, where thousands of GPUs must constantly communicate.\n\nMore News from Barchart A $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\nHere's what investors should know about CSCO stock in light of the news.\nWhy This Chip Changes the Game The G300 chip tackles AI's biggest infrastructure problem. When training large language models or running AI inference at scale, data must be constantly moved between GPUs. Any delays or dropped packets can stall entire jobs, wasting expensive compute time.\nCisco's chip uses something called Intelligent Collective Networking. Think of it as traffic management for data. The chip has an industry-leading buffer that can absorb sudden bursts of traffic without dropping packets. It also continuously monitors the network and reroutes traffic around issues before they cause failures.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Cisco reports that the technology delivers 33% higher network utilization than traditional approaches. Job completion times drop by 28%. That means more AI tokens generated per hour from the same GPU hardware. For companies spending millions on AI infrastructure, those improvements translate directly to better returns on investment.\nCisco has built complete systems around the G300 that address AI's power and cooling challenges. The new Cisco N9000 and Cisco 8000 systems come in both liquid-cooled and air-cooled versions. The liquid-cooled systems achieve nearly 70% better energy efficiency. One new system delivers the same bandwidth as six older systems. That matters enormously as data centers struggle with power constraints, fitting more AI capacity in the same physical space while using less energy.\nCisco also introduced 1.6 terabit optics and new 800G linear pluggable optics that cut power consumption by 50% compared to older designs. Overall, switch power consumption drops by 30%, improving operational reliability and sustainability.\n\nStory Continues\nMarket Traction Is Building Fast Cisco's management shared compelling numbers during recent investor conferences. The company took in $1.3 billion in AI infrastructure orders during just the first quarter of fiscal 2026. That's from hyperscalers alone. The figure doesn't include sovereign cloud providers, neoclouds, or enterprise customers.\nFor fiscal 2026, Cisco expects to take in at least double the $2 billion in AI orders from fiscal 2025, while AI-powered revenue should increase to $3 billion. Even more impressive, Cisco now has design wins at five of the six largest hyperscalers. In Q1 alone, the company won four new design wins across four different hyperscalers. These aren't one-time purchases, as design wins can generate orders for three-plus years. Four hyperscalers increased their orders with Cisco by more than 100% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That shows deepening relationships beyond initial trials.\n\nSilicon One gives Cisco real advantages. CFO Mark Patterson called it one of the company's \"most strategic assets.” The chip is also highly programmable. Customers can upgrade equipment with new features even after deployment. That protects long-term infrastructure investments and creates stickiness. Cisco now has a variety of Silicon One product families, covering everything from AI data centers to enterprise networks.\nBeyond Hyperscalers The hyperscaler business receives the most attention, but Cisco sees significant opportunities elsewhere. For example, the sovereign cloud and neocloud pipeline exceeds $2.5 billion. These customers want AI infrastructure but need local control over their data and operations. Cisco's relationships with partners such as HUMAIN position it well.\nEnterprise AI remains early, but could dwarf everything else. Cisco's partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) focuses on simplifying enterprise AI deployment. The companies offer validated reference architectures that remove complexity.\n\nPresident Jeetu Patel noted at Cisco's AI Summit that token generation will become \"one of the core currencies of every company and every country.\" Organizations that can generate AI tokens efficiently and cost-effectively will gain a competitive advantage.\nWhile AI grabs headlines, Cisco's campus networking refresh provides steady growth. The company has billions of dollars worth of installed switches approaching the end of support. These older systems pose security risks and can't handle modern AI workloads.\nCisco refreshed virtually its entire campus portfolio in June. The new switches incorporate AI and security directly into the fabric. Campus networking orders accelerated in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Adoption of new platforms is happening faster than previous product launches.\n\nThis isn't a one-quarter spike. The campus refresh will unfold over multiple years as enterprises modernize their networks to support AI-powered applications and agile workloads.\nFinancial Strength Supports Growth Cisco generated strong cash flow while investing heavily in AI. The company bought back $2 billion in CSCO stock during Q1 at an average price of $68. That shows management's confidence while returning capital to shareholders.\nGross margins held steady at around 68% despite the inclusion of a lower-margin hyperscaler business. The company manages its diverse portfolio to maintain profitability while growing revenue.\nOperating expenses are growing more slowly than revenue. Earnings are growing faster than the top line in every recent quarter and in the full-year guidance.\n\nThe Verdict on CSCO Stock Out of 24 analysts covering Cisco stock, 15 recommend a “Strong Buy,” one recommends a “Moderate Buy,” and eight recommend a “Hold” rating. That makes for a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating. The average CSCO stock price target is $86.90, which represents 16% potential upside from current levels.\nThe AI networking opportunity is massive, and Cisco has real technological advantages. Design wins at multiple hyperscalers validate the technology and create multi-year revenue streams.\nThe sovereign cloud and enterprise markets are just beginning. As AI moves beyond hyperscalers into broader deployment, Cisco's full-stack approach becomes even more valuable. Cisco's campus refresh also supports steady growth as the company scales its AI infrastructure. Security through Splunk adds another growth vector as customers prioritize protecting AI deployments.\n\nNear-term volatility is possible if AI spending pauses or memory costs spike. But Cisco's diversified business model and strong balance sheet can handle bumps. For investors who can handle some volatility, Cisco offers exposure to AI infrastructure growth at a reasonable valuation with dividend income while you wait.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nYanik Guillemette Announces Major Accolad Integration to Automate Referral Payments and Commercial Incentives\n\nAccolad Technologies Inc.\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nWMT\n\nMONTREAL, Feb. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Yanik Guillemette , technology entrepreneur and Chair of Accolad ’s External Advisory Committee on Technology and Innovation, today announced the deployment of a new automation infrastructure enabling Canadian organizations to instantly manage referral payments, sales incentives, and customer rewards through an expanded digital gift card marketplace.\n\nThis development marks an important milestone for Accolad, whose platform now provides access to more than 200 international digital gift cards , including Amazon, Walmart, Esso, Boston Pizza, and IKEA, while also promoting a strong local ecosystem featuring over 70 recognized Québec-based businesses .\nThese include brands such as Lambert, Mia Bijoux, La Cordée, Strøm Spa Nordique, St-Hubert, and many other Québec companies, allowing organizations to balance operational simplicity with support for local commerce.\nAutomating What Was Previously Manual\nHistorically, referral programs and commercial incentive payments relied on fragmented processes, including manual transfers, physical gift cards, heavy administrative tracking, and significant delays.\n\nAccolad’s new integration is designed to eliminate these operational frictions.\n“Organizations want to reward people quickly — whether it’s a referring customer, a salesperson exceeding targets, or a partner closing a transaction. Until now, these payments were surprisingly complex to manage. Our goal was to make them as simple as sending an email,” said Yanik Guillemette .\nThe platform now enables:\nAutomated referral payments;\nSales contests and performance challenges management;\nDistribution of digital commercial incentives;\nRapid issuance of compensations or promotional rewards;\nIntegration of incentives directly into automated customer journeys.\n\nGrowing Adoption Across Travel and Insurance Industries\nAccolad is seeing accelerating adoption in sectors where financial incentives play a strategic role, including:\n\nTour operators and travel agencies;\nInsurance providers;\nInsurance brokers;\nPartner and affiliate networks.\nThese organizations now use the platform to deliver digital bonuses and rewards to clients or partners, significantly simplifying administrative compliance and accounting processes.\n“In many industries, issuing a bonus or reward remains unexpectedly complicated. Our objective is to transform these payments into an instant, traceable, and fully automated process,” added Guillemette.\nSupporting Local Economies in a Digital Environment\nBeyond automation, Accolad promotes a hybrid approach combining global brands with local merchants.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to the company, this strategy enables organizations to offer meaningful rewards while supporting Québec businesses — an increasingly important factor for employers and corporate partners.\nInfrastructure Designed for the Relationship Economy\nThis integration reflects a broader trend: the rise of the relationship economy, where growth increasingly depends on referrals, partnerships, and customer loyalty alongside traditional acquisition strategies.\n\nAccolad positions its technology as an invisible infrastructure layer enabling large-scale automation of incentive micro-payments.\n“Referral programs and commercial incentives are becoming major growth drivers. Our role is to remove operational complexity so organizations can focus on building stronger relationships with customers and partners,” concluded Yanik Guillemette .\nAbout Accolad\nAccolad is a Canadian technology platform specializing in the automation of recognition programs cards, digital rewards, and commercial incentives. The solution enables organizations to securely distribute rewards and digital payments at scale through an extensive catalogue of local and international brands.\nMedia Contact\nJulie Tessier\nHead of Communications\nAccolad\nEmail: j.tessier@accolad.com\nPhone: 579-274-1477\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b0ba4431-b6d1-4b86-acd3-384bcc6ebcda\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Leading bank calls AI threat to enterprise software \"illogical,\" upgrades five stocks for 2026\n\nProactive\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:30 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: HSBC\n\nCRWD\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nNOW\n\nWall Street's panic over artificial intelligence replacing enterprise software is misguided, according to HSBC's latest research report. The investment bank argues 2026 marks a crucial shift from AI infrastructure build-out to actual monetisation through software, positioning established platforms to benefit rather than suffer from the technology's rise.\n\n\"Market concerns that AI will replace enterprise software are misplaced,\" writes Stephen Bersey, HSBC's head of US technology research, in the February report. The firm upgraded CrowdStrike to 'buy' and maintains 'buy' ratings on Oracle, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Palantir, while downgrading IBM and Asana on structural concerns.\nSoftware companies will capture the lion's share of AI value\nHSBC's core thesis challenges the prevailing narrative that AI coding assistants will disrupt traditional software vendors. The bank draws parallels to the internet era, when initial value creation concentrated in physical infrastructure like servers and fibre optics before shifting decisively to software applications.\n\nThe analysts expect AI hardware scarcity to persist for several years due to GPU shortages, power constraints, and data centre limitations. This scarcity reinforces their view that lasting value will flow to software platforms capable of monetising AI through scalable, repeatable use cases.\n\"We see AI as the primary source of value creation of the software stack, with the largest share of long-term value accruing to software rather than hardware,\" the report states.\nEnterprise complexity creates defensive moats\nHSBC dismisses concerns that large language models will simply rewrite legacy applications. The bank notes that LLMs trained on public data lack knowledge of optimised, large-scale private architectures developed over decades by companies like Oracle and SAP.\n\nEven with strong code, new entrants face daunting barriers, the report argues. Enterprise software requires years demonstrating 99.999% uptime, error-free operations across diverse IT environments, trusted brands, and enterprise sales forces. Switching costs remain prohibitively high given risks of revenue disruption, productivity loss, and unforeseen system failures during platform replacements.\nAgents emerge as the primary monetisation vehicle\nThe bank predicts 2026 will see widespread deployment of task-specific, workflow-embedded AI agents across Fortune 2000 companies and small businesses. Unlike generic chatbots, these agents operate within defined parameters that allow enterprises to manage risks and control usage.\n\nStory Continues\nThis agent-driven approach enables the controlled, governable AI adoption that enterprises demand. HSBC expects inference demand to surpass training requirements over time, driving sustained growth in compute consumption as agentic AI becomes pervasive.\nThe firm characterised 2024 and 2025 as building years focused on developing AI models, infrastructure, and code integration. Now, with those foundations in place, enterprise-level deployment can accelerate. The analysts maintain 'reduce' ratings on CoreWeave and Palo Alto Networks alongside IBM and Asana\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Proto Labs and PayPal have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: PRLB\n\nPYPL\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; February 13, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Proto Labs PRLB, as the Bull of the Day and PayPal PYPL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on &mdash;Amazon AMZN, Meta META and Alphabet GOOGL.\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\nBull of the Day: The market has been flirting with highs again. When that happens, investors tend to chase whatever&rsquo;s moving. But that&rsquo;s not how you win long term. When volatility creeps back in, and it always does, you want stocks with real earnings momentum underneath the hood. The last couple of weeks, the market has begun to show signs of volatility, so it&rsquo;s really a great time to laser in your focus on names with strong earnings momentum.\nStrong earnings momentum like today&rsquo;s Bull of the Day, Proto Labs . Proto Labs is a digital manufacturing company specializing in rapid prototyping and low-volume production. Through CNC machining, injection molding, sheet metal fabrication, and industrial 3D printing, they help engineers go from design to production faster than traditional manufacturers. In a world obsessed with supply chain resilience and speed to market, that&rsquo;s not a bad place to be.\n\nOver the last week, a couple of analysts have really upped the ante on the current year numbers. It&rsquo;s taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate up from $1.59 to $1.80 for the current year. Next year&rsquo;s number is at $1.94. That means we are forecasting 8.43% earnings growth this year and 8.06% next year. That&rsquo;s on revenue growth of 5.95% this year and 5.98% next year.\nManufacturing is quietly undergoing a digital transformation. Companies want shorter lead times, more customization, and less inventory risk. Proto Labs sits right at that intersection. This isn&rsquo;t a flashy AI darling. It&rsquo;s not a meme stock. It&rsquo;s an infrastructure play on modern manufacturing.\nProto Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Proto Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nTechnically speaking, the stock has been building a base after prior declines. When you combine improving technical structure with rising earnings estimates, that&rsquo;s often when institutional money starts to lean in.\nThe stock is really moving in the right direction as these earnings estimates have gone the same way. A consistent track record of earnings beats is underlying the move higher as well. The company has not missed earnings expectations since late 2021.\nBear of the Day: After reporting a mixed quarter last week, PayPal not only cratered 20% but shares fell into the cellar of the Zacks Rank as most analysts lowered full year 2026 and 2027 EPS estimates.\n\nStory Continues\nThis year's Zacks EPS consensus dropped from $5.83 to $5.38, representing projected growth of only 1.3%. And next year was clipped 11% from $6.64 to $5.91 in the past two months.\nAnd this week, the analyst continue to condemn to the business with Truist Securities maintaining a \"Sell\" rating and slashing their price target from $58 to $39.\n\nQuarter Highlights Paypal reported $8.68 billion in revenue for the quarter ended December 2025, representing a year-over-year increase of 3.7%. But EPS of only $1.23 for the same period barely limped over the $1.19 post a year ago.\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of -1.07% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.77 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $1.29, the EPS surprise was -4.36%.\nThis article explains more about the company's business...\nPayPal Reports Q4: What Key Metrics Have to Say\n\nPYPL&rsquo;s Revenue Details TPV was $475.14 billion for the fourth quarter, up 8.5% year over year on a reported basis and 6% on a forex-neutral basis.\n\nThe transaction margin in dollar terms was $4.03 billion, which grew 2.5% on a reported basis. Excluding interest on customer balances, transaction margin dollars increased 3.8% to $3.74 billion.\nTransaction revenues were $7.82 billion (90.1% of net revenues), up 3% year over year. Value Added Services revenues were $857 million (9.9% of net revenues), which rose 10.2% year over year.\n\nNet revenues from the United States totaled $4.94 billion (57% of net revenues), up 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. International net revenues were $3.73 billion (43% of net revenues), up 2.7% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a forex-neutral basis.\nPayPal witnessed year-over-year growth of 1.2% in total active accounts to 439 million in the reported quarter. The total number of payment transactions was 6.75 billion, up 2% on a year-over-year basis. However, PYPL&rsquo;s payment transactions per active account were 57.7, which dropped 4.8% year over year.\nBottom line: As banks become more agile and mobile with services, there's been lots of disruption in the fintech space for an early pioneer like PayPal, to say nothing of all the new competition. According to analysts, expect that trend to continue.\n\nAdditional content: Why Have Tech Stocks Lost Their Mojo? The Tech sector&rsquo;s 2025 Q4 earnings results have been very good. But what accounts for the group&rsquo;s stock market underperformance in recent days can broadly be connected to two factors. At one level is the resumption of the market&rsquo;s unease with the ever-rising capex budgets from the Mag 7 group.\nThis isn&rsquo;t a new issue and has been with us for some time, but this reemerged as a headwind for the group after bigger-than-expected capex announcements from Amazon , Meta and Alphabet on their respective Q4 earnings calls.\n\nThe other issue is tied uncertainty around the legacy software business in the coming AI world, with many investors fearing that these software operators may not be as profitable going forward as they have been in the past.\nWith respect to actual earnings, both results for 2025 Q4 and outlook for the current and coming quarters, the Tech sector remains well positioned. The group has been a key growth driver over the last few years and it continues to play that role in the 2025 Q4 earnings season and is expected to remain a leader in the coming periods as well.\nIn terms of the Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 358 S&P 500 members or 71.6% of the index&rsquo;s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +13% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating EPS estimates and 72.1% beating revenue estimates.\n\nTo learn more about the Q4 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> Analyzing the Evolving Earnings Picture: What Should Investors Know?\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "GLW Rides on Solid Traction in Optical Communication: Will it Sustain?\n\nAritra Chatterjee\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GLW\n\nCIEN\n\nAPH\n\nMETA\n\nCorning Incorporated GLW is benefiting from healthy traction in the Optical Communications segment. The company generated $6.3 billion in revenues from this segment in 2025, registering impressive growth of 35% year over year. In 2025, the company’s enterprise network business grew a staggering 61% year over year. Corning started to ship data center products in early 2025, and its sales have increased significantly since then.\n\nHigh bandwidth, optimized power consumption and reduced space usage are critical for AI workloads. Corning’s high-density fiber, cable and connectivity solutions effectively match these requirements.\n\nGen AI-driven data center buildouts are a major growth driver for Corning. The company has garnered solid market traction among hyperscaler customers. GLW recently inked a multiyear agreement with Meta Platforms. The deal is valued at $6 billion. Meta is set to utilize Corning’s leading-edge optical fiber, cable and connectivity products needed for high-speed AI data centers. Similar long-term agreements with other hyperscalers are under negotiation. GLW is set to benefit from hyperscaler AI data center spending in the upcoming quarters. The company’s carrier network business grew 15% year over year, backed by solid demand for data center interconnect.\n\nCorning’s risk-sharing business model, which includes customer prepayments and stringent long-term customer commitments, reduces risk associated with fluctuating demand and capex. Such approach bodes well for sustainable growth.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Corning faces competition from Amphenol Corporation APH and Ciena Corporation CIEN in this domain. The growing use of AI and machine learning applications is driving demand for Amphenol’s high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect solutions. Amphenol is witnessing solid traction in its Communications Solutions segment. The segment generated $3.42 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 77.5% year over year.\n\nCiena has been diversifying its footprint in the data center connectivity vertical. It is increasingly investing in the data and optical fiber market to cash in on the tremendous growth opportunity presented by bandwidth demand from network service providers. Ciena generated $1.05 billion in revenues from the Networking Platforms segment, up 22% year over year.\n\nCorning's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Corning has gained 152.3% compared to the communications components industry’s growth of 179.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, GLW is currently trading at a discount compared with the industry. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 41.88 forward 12-month earnings, lower than 42.62 for the industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for Corning for 2025 and 2026 have increased over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCorning currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Top Drone Tech Stocks to Watch as Adoption Accelerates\n\nVaishali Doshi\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:29 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nAn updated edition of the Dec 24, 2025 article.\nThe global drone technology market is entering a new phase of expansion, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) and cloud computing.\nThe embedding of AI has made modern drones faster and more versatile than ever. AI incorporation is driving the autonomous navigation functionality of drones, enabling them to autonomously plan their flight paths based on real-time data, such as environmental terrain. The integration of 5G and advanced Wi-Fi technology has improved real-time data transmission, expanding commercial applications.\n\nOnce a key defense application, drones are now gaining rapid mainstream adoption, reshaping how governments, businesses and consumers approach border defense, surveillance, logistics and infrastructure monitoring. Drones have become integral to various sectors like mining, infrastructure monitoring, real estate, oil and gas exploration and even filmmaking. Retail behemoths like Walmart and Amazon are increasingly deploying drones in logistics for last mile delivery.\nThe defense segment continues to serve as a major growth engine. Within the defense vertical, growing geopolitical strains and defense upgrades are driving increased drone adoption worldwide. Globally, drones are now being widely deployed for border security, precision strikes, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (&ldquo;ISR&rdquo;), and other tactical operations, making them indispensable assets in modern warfare.\n\nDrone swarm technology is another eye-catching development. Drone swarms are a synchronized operation of numerous autonomous drones working in tandem and using AI and real-time communication to achieve common objectives. In an asymmetric fight, a well-coordinated swarm attack could subdue enemy air defenses, giving the smaller armies an edge. Apart from military operations, the usage of drone swarms is being extensively explored for tasks like large-area surveillance and search-and-rescue.\nWith regulatory frameworks evolving and military and commercial adoption gaining pace, the drone sector has a long runway for growth. The unmanned aerial vehicle (&ldquo;UAV&rdquo;) drones market is expected to witness a CAGR of 16.77% from 2026 to 2035, according to a report from Precedence Research.\n\nMoreover, the shift toward the &ldquo;drone-as-a-service&rdquo; model is opening recurring revenue streams through software subscriptions and maintenance services, thereby improving the visibility for drone tech companies.\nIf you are looking to capitalize on this trend, our Drone Technology Screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks, such as Ondas, Inc. ONDS, Draganfly Inc. DPRO and Red Cat Holdings, Inc. RCAT.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 36 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Investing Screens and uncover your next big opportunity.\n3 Drone Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Ondas is gaining from pivot to autonomous systems via its Ondas Autonomous Systems (&ldquo;OAS&rdquo;) segment. A rapidly expanding opportunity set encompassing strategic partnerships (Rift Dynamics) and NDAA-compliant U.S. production readiness bodes well for OAS. New opportunities in the C-UAS segment and ground robotics offerings, particularly within the Unmanned Ground Vehicle portfolios, further strengthen Ondas&rsquo; long-term growth profile.\n\nONDS is focusing on M&A to strengthen portfolio offerings and broaden reach across multiple domains like unmanned ground systems, robotics and fiber optic communications, subsurface intelligence and demining robotics. In the past few months, it has acquired Sentrycs, Apeiro Motion, Zickel, among others. ONDS acquired Roboteam, a company specializing in multi-mission tactical ground robotics. It recently announced an agreement to buy Rotron Aero, a UK-based developer of advanced UAS and long-range autonomous platforms.\n\nAt its investor day, ONDS highlighted that its pro forma cash balance exceeded $1.5 billion, adjusted for its recently completed equity offering of approximately $1 billion, providing substantial financial flexibility for both organic and inorganic expansion.\n\nFor 2026, Ondas has raised its revenue outlook to $170-$180 million, representing a 25% increase over the previous target of $140 million, which included an estimated $30 million contribution from Roboteam. This upward revision underscores improved backlog and revenue visibility.\n\nONDS carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nDraganfly is a Canada-based drone solutions and systems developer. The company&rsquo;s drones include the Commander 3XL, Heavy Lift Drone, Commander 2 and Draganfly Medical Response Drone. The company&rsquo;s Apex drone is aimed at ISR, marketed for both the military and public safety. Apex drone boasts dual payload capabilities and AI computing, powered by NVIDIA&rsquo;s chips. Further, DPRO&rsquo;s NDAA-compliant FlexForce FPV (first-person view) drone can be flown individually or autonomously, or swarmed.\n\nDPRO has 5-plus drone systems that are all NDAA-compliant. As the United States and NATO aggressively eliminate non-compliant Chinese systems from critical infrastructure, this compliance advantage becomes a moat. In October 2025, the company introduced its Outrider Southern Border drone, which is a North American-built, NDAA-compliant multi-mission drone platform.\n\nIncreasing deals with the U.S. military bode well. One of the most significant developments is the company&rsquo;s first major U.S. Army FPV drone order, which is not only a product sale but also includes providing supply chain and logistical support. It also includes onsite assembly and manufacturing training for the Army to allow them to make &ldquo;modifications on the fly.&rdquo; DPRO recently won a contract along with its partner, DelMar Aerospace Corporation, to supply Flex FPV Drones and Training to U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nDPRO, a Zacks Rank #2 stock at present, is expanding its footprint in the demining vertical with collaborations with Autonome Labs and SafeLane. With its data, expertise and AI-powered aerial mapping capabilities, DPRO is well-positioned to expand in this niche market. In the last reported quarter, the company achieved 14.4% year-over-year revenue growth, supported by rising product sales.\n\nRed Cat Holdings specializes in robotic hardware-software integration for applications for both military and commercial uses. Teal Drones and FlightWave Aerospace are two of its wholly-owned affiliates. The company is also broadening its reach into the maritime sector through Blue Ops, Inc., where it is developing uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). Its portfolio also includes Black Widow (small, unmanned aircraft systems), TRICHON (a hybrid VTOL) and FANG, an NDAA-compliant FPV drone.\n\nRCAT is witnessing solid demand from defense and government clients and expanding program wins. The company is also sharpening its ability to rapidly scale production to meet mission-critical requirements. On the last earnings call, management emphasized &ldquo;factories are the moat,&rdquo; with expanded facilities in Salt Lake City, UT, and Los Angeles, and a newly opened 155,000-square-foot plant in Georgia (large-scale USVs manufacturing).\n\nThe inclusion of the FANG FPV drone on the Blue UAS cleared list, NATO NSPA catalog approval for the Black Widow system, and integration of Palantir&rsquo;s Visual Navigation software for Black Widow in GPS-contested environments materially expand Red Cat&rsquo;s addressable market.\n\nRCAT, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), recently reported preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2025. Fourth-quarter 2025 revenues are expected to be between $24 million and $26.5 million, significantly up from $1.3 million reported in the prior-year period, while 2025 revenues are projected to be between $38 million and $41 million, up about 153% from $15.6 million posted in 2024. The upward revision is driven by strong execution across the board.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Will Data Center Unit Help NVIDIA Reach Its $65B Q4 Revenue Goal?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 25, and it would be no surprise if the company reaches another sales milestone and surpasses the $65 billion target. NVDA has been setting new sales records for the past few quarters. In the last reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, its revenues reached a new record of $57.01 billion, reflecting a 62% year-over-year increase.\n\nNVIDIA is optimistic that the growth momentum will continue as it again targets record revenues of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. The key driver behind this outlook is its booming data center business, which continues to power the company’s growth amid the global buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the data center business unit reported $51.22 billion in revenues, up 66% from last year.\nThe segment reached new highs as demand for accelerated computing, generative AI, and large-scale model training continued to rise across cloud providers and enterprise customers. Much of the momentum came from the rapid adoption of the GB300 platform and wider deployment of NVIDIA’s networking products, including NVLink and Spectrum-X. With hyperscalers racing to expand AI capacity, NVIDIA remained a key beneficiary of record spending on high-performance infrastructure.\n\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance graphics processing unit clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth.

      "Content": "Will Data Center Unit Help NVIDIA Reach Its $65B Q4 Revenue Goal?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 25, and it would be no surprise if the company reaches another sales milestone and surpasses the $65 billion target. NVDA has been setting new sales records for the past few quarters. In the last reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, its revenues reached a new record of $57.01 billion, reflecting a 62% year-over-year increase.\n\nNVIDIA is optimistic that the growth momentum will continue as it again targets record revenues of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. The key driver behind this outlook is its booming data center business, which continues to power the company’s growth amid the global buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the data center business unit reported $51.22 billion in revenues, up 66% from last year.\nThe segment reached new highs as demand for accelerated computing, generative AI, and large-scale model training continued to rise across cloud providers and enterprise customers. Much of the momentum came from the rapid adoption of the GB300 platform and wider deployment of NVIDIA’s networking products, including NVLink and Spectrum-X. With hyperscalers racing to expand AI capacity, NVIDIA remained a key beneficiary of record spending on high-performance infrastructure.\n\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance graphics processing unit clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the data center segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $58.72 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nThe growing demand for the company’s AI chips used in data centers is likely to continue aiding its overall top-line performance.

After opening strongly on Thursday, stocks immediately rolled over. By the first hour mark, they were down sharply, and although stocks didn't close at the lows, they remained down for the rest of the session. With a variety of issues weighing on stocks and a big rotation out of technology after three years of double-digit gains, we could be setting up for a sizable correction. Losses were steep across the board Thursday, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 2.04% at 22,597. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at 6,832, down 1.57%, and the Dow Jones Industrials were last at 49,451, down 1.34%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was also down more than 2% to 2,615.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Yields plummeted across the Treasury yield curve as investors ran for the safety and security of guaranteed U.S. government paper. The rally was fueled by weak economic data, including rising jobless claims and declining job openings, which increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, with the solid jobs numbers earlier in the week, and if todays consumer price index numbers come in higher than expected all bets are likely off. The 30 year long bond closed at 4.74%, while the ten year nore closed at 4.10%.\n\nOil and Gas: Oil and energy stocks have made a strong start in the first six weeks of 2026, but were hammered on Thursday after the International Energy Agency cut its 2026 demand growth outlook.

Natural gas was the lone winner in the sector, rising 1.87% to close at $3.21.\n\nGold: After a stunning bounce back from the recent flash-crash, gold took a solid hit on Thursday with the rest of the market. The bullion finished the day down 3.19% at $4,920. Falling below the $ 5,000-per-ounce level, which has been considered near-term support, was driven primarily by strong U.S. labor market data. This data reduced expectations for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and triggered a cascade of selling pressure as investors cut losses. As mentioned, if the CPI data comes in below expectations you can expect more buying. Silver also closed lower Thursday down a massive 10.65% at $75.19.\n\nStory Continues\nCrypto: The Crypto markets saw heavier selling on Thursday, with Bitcoin entering a deep rout and crypto-related stocks posting sharp declines following a prolonged, multi-month selloff.

      "Content": "4 ETFs to Capitalize on the Great Market Rotation\n\nSanghamitra Saha\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: XLP\n\nVHYAX\n\nVYM\n\nSPYV\n\nFXU\n\nWall Street is currently witnessing the &ldquo;Great Rotation,&rdquo; with investors shunning hot technology stocks in favor of smaller companies and other defensive sectors. The combination of &ldquo;AI capex fatigue,&rdquo; a resilient U.S. economy, and chances of a less-dovish Fed in the near term has led to the rotation in the market.\n\nInside the Emergence of Great Rotation The five largest U.S. cloud and AI infrastructure providers &ndash; Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle &ndash; have planned to spend between $660 billion and $690 billion combined capital expenditure in 2026, nearly doubling 2025 levels, as quoted on Futurum.\nMeanwhile, pure-play AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are seeing strong revenue growth, but their combined revenues are nowhere near the massive infrastructure spending made on them, per the same Futurum source.\nNo wonder, investors have started demanding clearer returns on massive spending after two years AI capex euphoria; Second, higher interest rates &mdash; with the 10-year Treasury yield over 4% &mdash; are pressuring long-duration growth valuations, pushing investors toward defensive and value sectors that normally fare better in higher-rate environments.\n\nThird, broadening market breadth, with about 65% of S&P 500 stocks outperforming the index &ndash; a level not seen in years, shows leadership expanding beyond mega-cap tech (read: A \"Great Rotation\" Is Underway: Zacks FEB 2026 Strategy).\nAs a result, the State Street SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV has added about 1.1% over the past one month (as of Feb. 12, 2026) versus a 1.8% decline in the State Street SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY. Meanwhile, growth stocks severely underperformed with State Street SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG slumping 4.3% during the same timeframe.\nETFs to Play Given the great rotation, some exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were depressed last year, have started to gain momentum this year. We have highlighted them below:\nState Street Cons Staples Sel Sec SPDR Inc ETF XLP\nThe fund has gained about 10% over the past one month (as of Feb. 12, 2026), breezing past SPY. XLP rose 9.6% over the past one year, down from the 11.7% one-year uptick in SPY. Staples companies and stocks are viewed as non-cyclical and tend to perform well even in an uncertain economy.\nFirst Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund FXU\nThe ETF has gained 7.8% over the past month. Utilities act as a defensive sector. Moreover, to support the power-hungry AI boom, utilities have received a leg up in today&rsquo;s environment. The fund has jumped about 22.9% over the past one year.\n\nStory Continues\nVanguard High Dividend Yield ETF VYM\nSeeking shelter in high-income ETFs also makes sense. In a volatile market, dividend ETFs normally come to the rescue. The hunt for dividends in the equity market is always on, irrespective of how the market is behaving. The ETF VYM has added about 4.7% over the past one month. The fund yields 2.24% annually.\n\nState Street SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF SPSM\nSmall caps have outperformed large-caps so far this year, supported by domestic focus, dollar strength and improving earnings outlook.The S&P SmallCap 600 index is projected to return to positive growth in 2025, with double-digit earnings expansion expected over the next two years, per Zacks Earnings Trends issued on Feb. 4, 2026. The SPSM ETF has added 2.3% over the past one month (read: 3 Sector ETFs & Stocks to Play in the Small-Cap Spectrum).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The Best Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 4:55 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KO\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nIt's not terribly difficult to find a decent dividend-paying stock. Finding one you can buy and hold forever, however, is a different story.\nThe underlying company must offer a product or service that will always be in demand. And that company's culture must be one that ensures perpetual success. These two standards will exclude most prospects.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nSuch dividend stocks are out there though, even if they're few and far between.\nHere's a closer look at three of them you can feel good about adding to your \"forever\" portfolio today.\n1. Coca-Cola Yes, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) shares fell following the release of the company's fourth-quarter results. Although per-share earnings of $0.58 topped analysts' estimates of $0.56, revenue of $11.82 billion came up slightly short of expectations.\nIt wasn't just the revenue miss responsible for the stock's weakness, however. Guidance for organic revenue growth of between 4% and 5% and per-share earnings growth of 7% to 8% wasn't quite what investors were hoping for either. March's upcoming switch to a new CEO -- current Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun -- also adds an element of uncertainty to Coca-Cola's future.\n\nFor income-minded long-term investors though, these are trivial details. Coca-Cola and all of its beverage brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Barq's root beer (just to name a few) are as endearing as they are enduring. It doesn't really matter who's at the helm.\nMoreover, while guidance for the year now underway may have been a bit of a letdown, sales and earnings are still outpacing inflation, supporting what's grown into a 63-year uninterrupted stretch of yearly per-share dividend payout increases. You'd be stepping into a forward-looking yield of 2.7%.\n2. Verizon With the United States' mobile phone market being as crowded and competitive as it is (Pew Research reports 98% of the nation's adults now own a mobile phone) clearly there's not a great deal of potential for capital growth with a stake in Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) . Yet what this telecom giant lacks in raw growth firepower, it more than makes up for in the form of income. The stock's forward-looking yield currently stands right around 6%. You'd be hard-pressed to find better from a name with comparable risk.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd there's longevity here to be sure.\nWhile it's not a statistic to be proud of, a 2024 survey performed by Harmony Healthcare IT suggests the average American spends more than five hours per day looking at their mobile phone. Right or wrong, they're not about to let go of their handheld connection to the outside world now.\n\n3. Realty Income Finally, add Realty Income (NYSE: O) to your list of dividend stocks to buy and hold forever.\nIt's a real estate investment trust, or REIT for short. That just means it's a landlord, and passes along the majority of its rent-based profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Realty Income's focus is on brick-and-mortar retailing. Its top tenants include 7-Eleven, Dollar General , FedEx , Walmart , and Home Depot .\nIt sounds scary, given the e-commerce-driven headwind that all brick-and-mortar retailers seem to be facing now.\n\nRealty Income is largely sidestepping this challenge, however, by serving the retail industry's most resilient names. Proof of this resiliency lies in the fact that this REIT's occupancy rate currently stands at 98.7%, and that it's now raised its monthly dividend payment -- yes, monthly -- for 31 consecutive years. Newcomers will be stepping into a yield of just over 5.1%.\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now? Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Prediction: Alphabet Will Be a $5 Trillion Stock by the End of 2027\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 4:39 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nThere are 12 publicly listed companies around the world valued at $1 trillion or more, with some of them graduating into the $2 trillion, $3 trillion, and even $4 trillion clubs. However, only Nvidia has crossed the exclusive $5 trillion milestone, although only for a very brief period last October, because its stock has since lost around 8% of its peak value.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and more. These businesses have laid the foundation for the company's highly successful artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, which is driving incredible value for its shareholders. In fact, its stock has soared by 73% over the last 12 months alone.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAlphabet has a market capitalization of $3.92 trillion as I write this, and here's why I think it has a clear pathway to the $5 trillion club.\nAI has transformed Google Search When the AI boom started gathering momentum in early 2023, investors were worried chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT would steal internet traffic away from traditional search engines. This would've dealt a serious blow to Alphabet, because the advertising dollars brought in by Google Search represent more than half of the company's total revenue.\nFortunately, Alphabet moved fast by launching its own family of AI models called Gemini. The latest Gemini 3 models are among the best in the industry, and they are now powering AI Overviews in Google Search, which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide fast answers to almost any query. Overviews appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer need to sift through web pages to find information.\n\nGoogle Search also has another new feature called AI Mode, which allows users to open a chatbot-style interface if they want to expand on a particular search query to find deeper answers. Alphabet says AI Mode queries are three times longer than traditional search queries, on average, so the feature is boosting engagement. In other words, users might be more likely to stick with Google Search now instead of venturing off to use third-party chatbots.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2025 (ended Dec. 31), Alphabet said Google Search saw more usage than ever before thanks to its new AI features. In fact, the platform generated a record $63.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, which was up 17% from the year-ago period. That growth rate accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, which truly highlights its AI-led momentum.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud is amassing a huge order backlog from AI customers While Google Search is Alphabet's largest business, Google Cloud consistently generates the fastest growth. It brought in a record $17.6 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, which was up by an eye-popping 48% year over year. As was the case with Search, this was also the third straight quarter in which Google Cloud's revenue growth accelerated.\nGoogle Cloud has become a top destination for businesses and developers looking to create and deploy AI software. It operates state-of-the-art data centers and rents the computing capacity to its customers for a fee. This infrastructure is fitted with the latest AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia, but Alphabet also designed its own chips called tensor processing units (TPUs) to give customers more optionality. These TPUs were used to train Gemini 3, and they are now being used by leading start-ups like Anthropic.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Google Cloud also offers access to AI platforms, AI agents, and the latest AI models from a variety of third parties, which combine to accelerate its customers' development projects. Alphabet says customers using Google Cloud for AI purposes adopt 80% more products than those that aren't, which highlights how important this technology is for the platform.\nGoogle Cloud ended 2025 with an annual revenue run rate of $70 billion. However, it also ended the year with a staggering $240 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more AI infrastructure to come online, which soared 55% from the previous quarter just three months earlier. This suggests the cloud platform might be poised for even faster revenue growth in the future.\n\nHow Alphabet can achieve a $5 trillion valuation Alphabet generated total earnings of $10.81 per share in 2025, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30. That is a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 31.5, so you could argue Alphabet is cheap relative to its big-tech peers.\nBut looking ahead, Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests Alphabet's earnings could grow to $11.42 per share in 2026, followed by $13.26 per share in 2027, placing its stock at forward P/E ratios of 28.3 and 24.4, respectively.\nIn other words, Alphabet stock would have to soar by 23.4% by the end of 2027 just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 30. That alone would catapult the company's market cap to $4.84 trillion -- a stone's throw away from the exclusive $5 trillion milestone. However, if Alphabet's P/E ratio were to rise slightly higher to trade in line with the P/E of the Nasdaq-100 (31.5), that would be enough to nudge the company's valuation above the $5 trillion mark.\n\nThat is a real possibility in my opinion, considering the significant AI-driven momentum in the Google Search and Google Cloud businesses alone. As a result, Alphabet could be less than two years away from becoming a $5 trillion company.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

The 1 year total shareholder return is also very large, suggesting sentiment around AI infrastructure exposure has shifted quickly in Lumentum’s favour.\nIf Lumentum’s surge has you looking beyond a single name, this could be a good moment to see what else is moving in AI hardware and networking through our screener of 34 AI infrastructure stocks .\nWith revenue, earnings and AI demand all pointing in the same direction, the key question now is whether Lumentum’s current valuation still leaves any upside on the table, or if the market is already paying for future growth.\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 68% Overvalued At the last close of $583.46, the most followed narrative puts Lumentum’s fair value closer to $348.38, creating a wide gap that hinges on aggressive AI optics assumptions.\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see what is backing this rich valuation gap? The narrative leans on rapid revenue expansion, sharply higher margins and a future earnings multiple that assumes strong execution. Curious which specific growth and profitability targets have to fall into place? The full narrative lays out the financial path that supports that fair value line by line.\n\nAnalysts contributing to this narrative are building their fair value case using a discount rate of 8.41%, higher revenue growth estimates for cloud and AI related optics, and materially stronger profit margins than today. That combination supports a future earnings profile that, if achieved, could justify paying a premium multiple relative to more traditional communications names, even as the current share price already sits above the narrative’s own fair value estimate.\n\nStory Continues\nResult: Fair Value of $348.38 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this upbeat setup still leans heavily on just a few hyperscale customers and assumes Lumentum can ease current production constraints without stumbling.\nFind out about the key risks to this Lumentum Holdings narrative.\n\nAnother Way to Look at Lumentum’s Value Analysts see Lumentum as 68% overvalued at $583.46 against a $348.38 fair value in the prevailing narrative, but our DCF model points the other way, with an $852.15 estimate suggesting the shares trade about 31.5% below that mark.

      "Content": "Despite the downward trend in earnings at NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) the stock rallies 8.0%, bringing three-year gains to 36%\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nBuying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the NXP Semiconductors N.V. ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) share price. It's up 29% over three years, but that is below the market return. In the last year the stock has gained 8.1%.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for NXP Semiconductors investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver the last three years, NXP Semiconductors failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 9.0% (annualized).\nThis means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.7% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. The revenue drop of 3.4% is as underwhelming as some politicians. The only thing that's clear is there is low correlation between NXP Semiconductors' share price and its historic fundamental data. Further research may be required!\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nNXP Semiconductors is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for NXP Semiconductors in this interactive graph of future profit estimates .\nWhat About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of NXP Semiconductors, it has a TSR of 36% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective NXP Semiconductors provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 7% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NXP Semiconductors better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with NXP Semiconductors .\n\nStory Continues\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Will the Stock Market Crash in 2026? Here's What the Data Suggests Will Happen.\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nThe last three years have been quite pleasant for growth investors. Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the technology sector has witnessed a once-in-a-generation boom that's spread to other industries across energy, industrials, utilities, and more. As such, it's been pretty hard to lose money in the stock market in recent years.\n\nUnfortunately, the euphoria train seems to have hit a hiccup in 2026. So far this year, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has gained less than 2% while the Nasdaq Composite is unchanged.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nLet's dig into what's causing the markets to take a breather. From there, we will dig into the strategies smart investors are employing to help weather current market conditions.\nValuation: Is the Shiller CAPE ratio warning of 1999 repeating? If you tune into financial news talk shows, it's common to hear economists and equity research analysts talk about valuation metrics. For instance, analysts love comparing a company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio relative to historical periods to help gauge whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued.\nAlthough this approach can make sense, one of its flaws is that it does not fully account for anomalies such as periods of unusually high inflation or one-time line items that can benefit (or hurt) a company's earnings growth.\n\nFor this reason, smart investors turn to a different metric to help assess current market conditions. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, developed by economist Robert Shiller, accounts for a decade's worth of earnings relative to stock performances over that time frame. In this sense, economic outliers become smoothed out and investors are able to achieve a more normalized look at valuation.\nRight now, the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio is hovering just below 40. The only other time the CAPE ratio was close to its current level was just before the dot-com bubble burst. With this overlap in mind, some investors are wary that history is poised to repeat itself and the stock market is warning us of another 1999 in the making.\n\nAI vs. dot-com: Why this generational shift is and isn't a bubble On the surface, it's easy to call the current AI revolution a stock market bubble given its similarities to soaring stock prices from the late 1990s. While I understand the comparison, I see the AI rally as quite different from the dot-com boom.\n\nStory Continues\nDuring the late 1990s, many companies merely relied on the potential of the internet rather than actually using the online domain to generate revenue or earnings. In other words, businesses were marketing vaporware -- tech products that do not actually work or provide useful efficiencies to their end users.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, many companies during the early days of the internet were hemorrhaging cash and did not, in fact, have a legitimate growth roadmap. The quality of earnings from the AI wave have been much stronger than what investors witnessed two decades ago.\nCloud hyperscalers like Amazon , Alphabet , and Microsoft , as well as AI chip designers Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Micron are all minting money. AI has become an epic bellwether for these and many other companies -- completely revolutionizing their business models and positioning them for long-term success as the multitrillion-dollar AI infrastructure era begins.\nPortfolio playbook: How to invest when markets feel frothy When the stock market feels inflated, it's not uncommon for investors to shift capital from volatile stocks and into more steady, predictable opportunities.\nFor instance, although AI has proven to be a net benefit for enterprise software, some companies have failed to gain meaningful traction or demonstrate that the technology doesn't undermine their business model. This is one reason software stocks are getting clobbered right now. In other words, AI is not a one-size-fits-all market opportunity. You need to be smart about which developers you invest in.\n\nDuring periods of market uncertainty and emotionally driven panic selling, the best approach is often to be boring and play it safe. A specific thing you can do is trim your exposure to speculative or volatile stocks that you're hoping to turn into multibaggers.\nInstead, opt for blue chip stocks with durable, resilient business models. This will help you create a diversified portfolio that's less vulnerable to harsh market corrections. Moreover, complementing these positions with a healthy cash balance will allow you to buy the dip during sell-offs -- doubling down on high-quality positions at a discount that should generate consistent gains for the long term.\nShould you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now? Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "History Says These 2 Dividend Stocks Will Deliver in a Downturn\n\nDave Kovaleski, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:25 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nLarge caps, particularly technology and growth stocks, have been more volatile this year, as valuations have shot close to 25-year highs after a three-year bull market.\nSome experts and market watchers have sounded the alarm that a correction could be coming, due to the high stock valuations, but also shaky geopolitical and macroeconomic forces.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAs an investor, it is impossible to know what's coming, although history is often a good guide. But what any smart investor should do is prepare their portfolio for the possibility to maximize gains in any type of environment.\nA great way to do this is to add strong dividend stocks to your portfolio. Not only did they generate income or boost total return when reinvested, but they are also typically value stocks , which tend to perform better in downturns.\n\nHere are two great dividend stocks provide both income and diversification.\nSpice and Spam If the market undergoes a correction or heads sideways for a spell, investors may want to turn to a couple of consumer staples companies that have a long history of consistently generating dividends and outperforming during market downturns.\nOne is Hormel (NYSE: HRL) , the maker of the canned meat product Spam, along with Skippy peanut butter, Dinty Moore beef stew, Planters nuts, Hormel Chili, and other food staples. These are products that are always popular, but they tend to become more sought-after during difficult economic times. It's mostly canned foods or less expensive items that people stock up on when budgets are stretched.\n\nGoing back to 2008, Hormel has outperformed the S&P 500 index in the year when the large-cap benchmark was either negative or had small, 1% or 2% returns.\nThe same is true for McCormick (NYSE: MKC) , the venerable spice maker that first opened its doors in 1889.\nLike Hormel, McCormick makes spices that are more popular during downturns, because people eat in more often, and use spices to give more flavor to cheaper, basic meals. And it also performs better than the larger markets when they are down or sluggish.\nDividend King with a high yield Both of these stocks have struggled in recent years, with negative returns over the past one- and five-year periods.\nBut their dividends remain strong. Hormel is a Dividend King, having increased its payout for 59 consecutive years. It also has one of the highest yields among S&P 500 stocks at 4.69%.\n\nStory Continues\nMcCormick is not far behind, with 39 straight years of dividend increases and a high yield of 2.85%.\nBoth stocks also have solid upside, according to analysts. Hormel has a median price target of $27.50, which would suggest 12% upside. McCormick has a median price target of $73 per share, which would represent an 8% return over the next 12 months.\n\nWith the potential for volatility in 2026, these stocks might provide some nice ballast, reliable income, and some downside protection in a growth-oriented portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Hormel Foods right now? Before you buy stock in Hormel Foods, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hormel Foods wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Despite Friday’s drop, the benchmark index posted strong gains for the week, marking its second consecutive weekly advance. Goldman Sachs strategists upgraded Japanese stocks to Overweight on Friday, citing expectations for “a period of political stability” and policy tailwinds for “defense, critical resources, shipbuilding, power resources, U.S. re-industrialization plays.” Meanwhile, Bank of Japan policy board member Naoki Tamura on Friday raised the possibility that the central bank could soon declare that its price target has been achieved. “It is quite possible that, as early as this spring, the price stability target of 2% can be judged to have been achieved,” Tamura said, highlighting his preference for a near-term rate hike.

      "Content": "AMD Taps Ariel Kelman To Sharpen AI And Data Center Story\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NasdaqGS:AMD) has appointed Ariel Kelman as Chief Marketing Officer.\nThe leadership change comes as AMD increases its focus on AI and data center products.\nKelman brings experience from major technology firms to sharpen AMD's global marketing efforts.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:AMD, this move comes at a time when the stock has delivered strong longer term returns, with a 1 year return of 84.2% and a 3 year return of 157.2%. The current share price of $205.94 places the company in the spotlight, as it competes for enterprise and AI workloads where clear product positioning can influence large customer decisions.\nKelman's appointment indicates that AMD is putting more emphasis on how it presents its AI and data center strategy to customers, partners and the broader market. As the company refines its offerings in these areas, investors may pay close attention to how effectively AMD communicates its product roadmap and value proposition relative to well funded competitors.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Advanced Micro Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Advanced Micro Devices.\nDoes the team leading Advanced Micro Devices have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\nKelman’s arrival comes just days after AMD reported record Q4 2025 revenue of US$10.27b and net income of US$1.51b, with data center and AI products sitting at the center of the story. As AMD pushes to position itself as a credible alternative to Nvidia and Broadcom in AI infrastructure, the way it tells that story to cloud providers, enterprises and developers starts to matter almost as much as the silicon itself. Kelman’s background at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle is closely aligned with the customer set AMD is targeting, especially hyperscalers and large software vendors that buy at rack scale and care about full platform offerings rather than just chips. Reporting into Ruth Cotter and working closely with the wider executive team, he will shape brand, go to market and developer engagement at a time when AMD is guiding to Q1 2026 revenue of about US$9.8b and is rolling out new accelerator and server CPU generations. For you as an investor, this leadership change is less about a sudden shift in strategy and more about execution quality on AI and data center growth plans that are already in motion.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Kelman’s enterprise focused background supports the existing narrative that AMD is leaning into long term AI and data center demand, especially with large cloud and sovereign projects that value consistent messaging and ecosystem building.\nAt the same time, his appointment highlights execution risk that the narrative already flags, since winning share from Nvidia, Intel and custom in house chips depends not just on products but on how effectively AMD convinces hyperscalers and governments to commit to multi year deals.\nThe narrative focuses heavily on product roadmaps and long term revenue assumptions, but it does not fully account for how a revamped marketing engine could influence developer adoption, software ecosystem depth and customer mix over the next few years.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Advanced Micro Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Higher marketing and ecosystem spending, on top of already elevated AI related operating expenses, could weigh on near term margins if revenue growth from data center and AI deals does not keep pace.\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged customer concentration and inventory risks around AI hardware, and a stronger push into large accounts under Kelman increases exposure if a few big customers delay or scale back spending.\n🎁 A CMO with deep experience at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle could help AMD sharpen its pitch to enterprise buyers and developers, supporting the company’s aim to grow AI and data center revenue over time.\n🎁 Better alignment between product, marketing and developer relations may help AMD differentiate its accelerators and EPYC server chips versus Nvidia and Broadcom, supporting efforts to win rack scale and platform deals.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on whether AMD’s marketing shift shows up in concrete ways, such as deeper partnerships with major cloud providers, clearer software and developer tool messaging around its Instinct accelerators, and more consistent positioning of EPYC based platforms against Nvidia and custom chips. Commentary on earnings calls around customer engagement, funnel visibility and AI deal quality will be useful signals for how effectively Kelman and the broader team are executing. You can also track whether higher operating expenses tied to AI and marketing are matched by sustained progress in data center revenue and any changes in analyst sentiment on execution risk.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Advanced Micro Devices, head to the community page for Advanced Micro Devices to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Should You Forget Tesla and Buy These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the quintessential hypergrowth stock for much of the last decade or more. But recently, it has entered a period of stagnancy. Its overall revenues have been flat to down since the end of 2023, and its operating income has slumped by more than half in the last few years.\nGlobal unit sales volumes for its electric vehicles have stopped growing. At the same time, the company is trying to pivot its focus to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, but has struggled to gain much traction in either space. It may be many years before those new business lines have a true impact on Tesla's bottom line.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nWith this in mind -- and with Tesla's $1 trillion market cap as of this writing -- investors may be smart to avoid buying the stock right now. Here are two other potential millionaire-maker stocks you may want to consider adding to your portfolio instead.\nAn opportunity in global money transfers Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) has grown impressively over the last few years. Through its mobile application, lower fees, and a better customer experience than is offered by rival services, it has begun to gain market share within the remittance space, which covers international money transfers.\nLast quarter, its active customers grew 21% year over year to 8.9 million, revenue grew 25% to $420 million, and the business generated positive net income. Over the next few years, management expects total revenue to about double to $3 billion, with $600 million in adjusted EBTIDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). That level of expected earnings makes its current market cap of $2.85 billion look mighty cheap.\n\nSome investors may shy away from Remitly because of the apparent threat that stablecoins pose to its business model, as, in principle, these cryptocurrencies allow people to more easily send money across borders freely. However, this runs into a speed bump when you have to convert stablecoins into local currencies, a process that always incurs costs. Investors are also wary of how the immigration crackdown in the United States will impact the market for cross-border remittances. The numbers so far don't show that as a cause for concern, however: Remitly's 2025 financials show no impact from stricter U.S. border and immigration policies. Moreover, there are still millions of immigrants in countries around the world who want to send money back home to their families, and that is not going to change anytime soon.\n\nStory Continues\nGiven Remitly's market cap below $3 billion and its expectations to generate over $500 million in adjusted earnings a few years from now, investors would be smart to buy the stock today and hold it for the long haul. It might just make you a lot of money.\nA misunderstood entertainment giant Another stock with a better setup than Tesla at the moment is Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) . The entertainment company that has dominated family-friendly video games for decades just released a new device, the Nintendo Switch 2, that is selling faster than the original Switch did.\nTotal sales are up by close to 100% year over year through the first three quarters of its fiscal 2026, which ends in March. However, the stock is down due to rising computer chip prices and a lack of flagship video game titles for the Switch 2 so far.\n\nIt is unclear how long these high chip prices will last, but those make up only a small part of Nintendo's input costs, and they will eventually subside. On the games front, Nintendo is notoriously patient with its release schedule, but it has increased its total investment in game development in recent years, which will eventually lead to more flagship titles. There are likely more Mario , Animal Crossing , and Pokémon titles in development right now.\nOn top of games, Nintendo is releasing the sequel to its animated Mario Movie in April. The original did over $1 billion at the box office. Combined with its new theme parks around the world, Nintendo has many more ways to interact with its fans than it did a decade ago, which should lead to higher game sales and greater profits.\n\nToday, Nintendo's market cap is $62 billion, but because of the huge amount of cash on its balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is well below $50 billion. As the Switch 2's player base continues to grow, annual earnings should reach well over $5 billion, if not significantly higher, within a few years. This makes Nintendo stock a bargain buy for investors looking to capitalize on the growth of the Switch 2.\nShould you buy stock in Remitly Global right now? Before you buy stock in Remitly Global, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Remitly Global wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Could Be the Best-Performing AI Chip Stock of 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 2:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: LITE\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending is poised to jump significantly in 2026, with a recent report from CNBC suggesting that the capital expenditures (capex) of the top four hyperscalers in the U.S. could soar to $700 billion this year. That would be a big jump over 2025's capex of $394 billion.\n\nSemiconductor companies are likely to win big from this massive outlay , as they provide the basic building blocks that enable AI training and inference. Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) is among the semiconductor companies playing a central role in the proliferation of AI.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nShares of this company that sells optical and photonic networking components enabling high-speed transmission in AI data centers are already trading up 56% in 2026. It won't be surprising to see this stock delivering more gains this year, potentially becoming the best-performing AI chip stock of 2026.\nLet's see why that may be the case.\nLumentum is clocking stellar growth thanks to AI Lumentum released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the period ended Dec. 27, 2025) on Feb. 3. The company reported a 66% year-over-year increase in revenue to $666 million, well ahead of the $652 million Wall Street estimate. Even better, the company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped nearly 4x year over year to $1.67 per share, crushing the $1.41-per-share consensus expectation.\nCEO Michael Hurlston remarked on the latest earnings call that Lumentum is playing a critical role in AI data centers:\nImportantly, Lumentum expects to grow at a faster pace going forward, driven by its solid backlog, new contracts, and capacity expansion plans. The company has a backlog of more than $400 million for its optical circuit switches that enable high-speed transmission in data centers.\nMeanwhile, the company received what it calls an incremental \"multi-hundred-million-dollar\" contract in co-packaged optics, which are deployed in custom AI processors for their higher bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n\nLumentum has been aggressively expanding capacity to meet the terrific end-market demand. It already achieved more than half of the targeted 40% capacity improvement in the previous quarter. Moreover, Lumentum plans to bring new capacity online at two of its plants in the U.K. and Japan later this year.\n\nStory Continues\nAccelerating growth should lead to more upside Lumentum management anticipates an 85% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter to $805 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. Its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.25 per share is almost 4x the earnings it clocked in the same period last year.\nAnalysts expect a 263% spike in Lumentum's earnings in the current fiscal year to $7.47 per share, followed by impressive jumps over the next couple of years as well.\nThe company may deliver stronger growth as it brings more capacity online. That could pave the way for more upside in this technology stock, which is why investors can consider buying Lumentum before it jumps higher.\nShould you buy stock in Lumentum right now? Before you buy stock in Lumentum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lumentum wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst NVIDIA, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Alibaba Group Holding\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 12:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nBABAF\n\nNVDA\n\nBABA\n\nINTC\n\nFor Immediate Releases Chicago, IL &ndash; February 13, 2026 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Intel Corp. INTC, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA.\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Bitcoin vs. NVIDIA: Digital Gold or AI Giant for Long-Term Growth? For long-term investors, Bitcoin (BTC) remains a highly speculative and volatile asset facing significant selling pressure. In contrast, NVIDIA Corp. stands out as a stronger long-term investment thanks to its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects. Here&rsquo;s why &ndash;\nBitcoin Sinks as Crypto Winter Deepens Bitcoin&rsquo;s price has been declining steadily for some time, ushering in what many are calling a crypto winter. After reaching an all-time high of $127,000 in October last year, the digital asset dropped below $90,000 in December and then slipped under $80,000 in January. Following its most recent slide, Bitcoin is now down 22.9% year to date, trading around $67,000.\nSo, what triggered the downfall? Obviously, Bitcoin entered a correction after record highs, as selling pressure intensified and profit-taking weighed on the price. At the same time, institutional participation declined as interest in the so-called digital gold cooled, contributing to broader pessimism across the crypto market. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $3 billion in January this year, following withdrawals of $7 billion in November and $2 billion in December last year.\n\nGeopolitical tensions also pushed investors toward safe havens like gold and silver, while demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies softened, as they are generally viewed as riskier investments. Overall, sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, remains weak, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly in the &ldquo;extreme fear&rdquo; territory.\nNVIDIA Rides AI Boom as Revenues Soar on Easing Trade Woes NVIDIA is undoubtedly encountering stiff competition from rivals like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . as data center capital expenditure increases. Nevertheless, driven by the rapid rise of AI, NVIDIA continues to deliver impressive quarterly results. This sustained performance is largely due to the incessant demand for its cutting-edge chips, especially the latest Blackwell architecture, as well as the ever-increasing need for cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA expects global data center spending to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion annually by 2030, creating a significant opportunity for the company to expand sales of its computing hardware. U.S.-China trade complications have also settled somewhat, which is a positive development for NVIDIA. Chinese officials have approved the sale of H200 AI chips to select customers, including ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The Trump administration has already granted approval for these chips to be shipped to China.\n\nNVIDIA now anticipates fiscal fourth-quarter 2026 revenues of nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company&rsquo;s revenues surged 62% year over year and 22% quarter over quarter to $57 billion.\nBitcoin or NVIDIA: Which Is the Better Long-Term Bet? After its peak, Bitcoin&rsquo;s downfall has been fueled by profit-taking, reduced institutional interest, rising geopolitical tensions that pushed investors toward safer assets, and overall weak sentiment across the crypto market. For now, the market appears to be waiting for fresh catalysts to resume Bitcoin&rsquo;s momentum. However, one thing is clear: it is a highly speculative asset, and it faces massive selling pressure during periods of negative investor sentiment, making it less suitable for a long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, NVIDIA is a proven stock that has delivered consistent returns despite geopolitical challenges and intense competition. NVIDIA remains strongly positioned for future growth fueled by rising demand for its chips and a continued increase in data center spending. NVIDIA&rsquo;s net profit margin of 53% exceeds the industry's average of 50.1%, underscoring its strong growth and making it an attractive long-term buy (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\nNVIDIA, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "2奈米搶奪戰 蘋果已失去「最大客戶」優勢 需與輝達爭搶台積電產能 鉅亨網新聞中心\n2026年2月13日 週五 上午12:20\n\n台積電\n2330.TW\n\n1,915 ( 1.86% ) AAPL\n\n260.23 ( 0.57% ) 更多\n\n蘋果公司 (AAPL-US) 近期在確保尖端半導體方面陷入苦戰，全球最大的代工企業台積電 (TSM-US)(2330-TW) 的產能不足，正在成為 iPhone 增產的瓶頸。而蘋果也失去做為第一大客戶的特殊優勢。\n此前超過 15 年，蘋果一直是台積電「優先客戶」，享有最先進製程的首發權與議價優勢。然而，隨著人工智慧基礎設施需求的爆炸式增長，這場權力結構正發生根本性轉變。在 2025 年，輝達 (NVDA-US) 已經超越蘋果，正式成為台積電營收貢獻度最高的客戶。\n輝達崛起與產能爭奪戰 數據顯示，輝達 2026 財年的增長率高達 62%，相較之下，蘋果的產品營收增長僅為 3.6%。台積電 2025 年的營收成長幾乎完全由高效能運算 (HPC) 驅動，市場預計， 2026 年輝達將占台積電營收份額的 20%，領先蘋果的 16%。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n這場權力轉移不僅體現在營收數字上，更是一場物理上的「矽晶圓爭奪戰」。一顆輝達 Blackwell 或 Rubin GPU 的晶粒面積超過 800 平方公釐，而蘋果 A20 晶片僅約 100 至 120 平方公釐。這意味著，每生產一顆輝達 GPU，就會消耗相當於 6 到 8 顆 iPhone 晶片的物理空間。\n\n據報導，截至 2026 年 1 月，台積電的 2 奈米產能已達到每月 50,000 片以上晶圓。台積電計畫在 2026 年年底前，將 2 奈米的月產能進一步提升至 120,000 至 140,000 片。儘管產能持續增加，但 2 奈米的所有產能目前已處於全數售罄的狀態，客戶甚至需要支付比 3 奈米高出 50% 的溢價 (每片晶圓約 3 萬美元) 來爭奪產量。\n當台積電產能滿載時，這便成了一場零和競爭，而願意支付高額溢價的 AI 客戶顯然更具優勢。\n議價優勢喪失與前所未有的漲價壓力 媒體報導，台積電執行長魏哲家於 2025 年 8 月親自造訪蘋果加州總部，傳達了一個關鍵訊號：蘋果將面臨「多年來最大幅度的漲價」，且不再享有保證產能的特權。\n過去蘋果憑藉龐大且穩定的訂單，能換取最優惠的製造條件，但如今台積電的產能分配更像是一場拍賣會，由利潤更高、成長更快的 AI 客戶取勝。\n台積電 2025 年第四季毛利率高達 62.3%，已接近軟體公司的水準，反映出其在供不應求環境下的強大議價力。\n蘋果的戰略調整 面對產能受限與成本攀升，蘋果採取了 15 年來首次的重大策略轉向。蘋果已宣布與英特爾 (INTC-US) 達成代工合作，預計在 2027 年將入門級 M 系列晶片 (如 MacBook Air 所用) 轉往 Intel 18A 製程生產，以規避單一供應鏈風險並緩解對台積電的依賴。\n同時，雙方的競爭火線已延伸至「先進封裝」領域。隨著蘋果 M5、M6 系列晶片導入 Chiplet 模組化設計並尋求 CoWoS 封裝架構，蘋果將與輝達在台積電 AP6 與 AP7 等 3D 先進封裝產線上「正面對撞」。業界普遍認為，未來幾年半導體產業的核心戰略將進入「封裝為王」的時代。\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "鉅亨投資雷達》勞退自提6%值得嗎？還是自己投資比較好？ 鉅亨買基金\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午10:56\n\n「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "鉅亨雙週報》AI股震盪、利率預期翻轉與日英政治巨浪 鉅亨買基金\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午10:55\n\nBTC-USD\n\n67,694.59 ( 0.69% )\n\n這兩週市場同時遭受 AI 海嘯、利率轉向與政治黑天鵝接連衝擊。美國聯準會立場轉鷹，川普提名前理事華許接掌聯準會主席，加上英國工黨面臨執政危機，以及日本高市早苗政府在大選勝出後，形同獲得一張擴張財政與強硬外交的空白支票。同時，從比特幣到白銀都在上演高台跳水，投資人忽然想起本益比三個字。當股匯債與原物料同步劇烈波動，這波震盪到底是短期情緒，還是新一輪景氣與政策循環的序曲？\n1. 利率與聯準會市場從等降息變成別作夢\n廣告\n廣告\n\n鮑爾在一月會議後明確表示經濟明顯改善且就業穩健，等於把上半年降息空間先行封鎖，聯邦基金期貨也乖乖把降息預期往後延。川普拋出凱文華許作為新任聯準會主席提名人選，市場開始重新計算未來利率路徑與美元走勢。降息不再是何時開始，而是會不會比想像中更少。在這種情況下，高估值科技股首當其衝，標普五百與那斯達克連日回檔。避險情緒升高卻無處躲避，連黃金都被追繳保證金的賣壓波及，提醒投資人利率週期尚未轉向。\n\n2. AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "MKS Dividend Hike Raises Questions On Debt Load And Cash Priorities\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 10:12 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MKSI\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nMKS (NasdaqGS:MKSI) announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend.\nThe new dividend level reflects a higher cash return to shareholders on a recurring basis.\nThe decision comes while the company is dealing with a high debt load and pressure on margins.\n\nMKS, listed on NasdaqGS:MKSI, supplies critical technologies to semiconductor and related electronics markets, areas that continue to attract attention from investors monitoring product cycles and capital spending trends. The 14% dividend hike is notable because it arrives during a period of financial and operational strain, with management opting to return more cash even as debt and margins remain key areas of focus.\nFor investors, this move raises practical questions about how MKS plans to balance cash returns with balance sheet priorities over time. The higher dividend may influence how some shareholders view capital allocation at MKS, particularly those weighing income needs against risks associated with leverage and profitability pressures.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for MKS by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on MKS.\nIs MKS's dividend sustainable? Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.\nThe 14% lift in MKS’s quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share points to management’s confidence in future cash generation, even as the company works through a sizeable debt load and margin pressure. Income-focused investors may see the higher regular cash return as a positive signal, but it also raises the bar for how consistently MKS needs to produce free cash flow. With interest costs already flagged as a risk and a high debt-to-equity position, the key question is whether the dividend and debt service can both be comfortably supported through a full semiconductor cycle.\n\nHow This Fits Into The MKS Narrative The dividend increase aligns with a narrative that leans on rising earnings power from AI-driven semiconductor demand and higher recurring revenues, suggesting management expects cash flows to support ongoing shareholder returns.\nAt the same time, using more cash for dividends could constrain flexibility to reduce leverage faster, which directly touches on the narrative risk around high debt and interest expense.\nThe recent refinancing and interest savings are not fully reflected in the narrative context, and these changes may influence how sustainable investors view the higher dividend over time.\n\nStory continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for MKS to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Analysts have highlighted that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, so a higher recurring dividend could tighten headroom if conditions weaken.\n⚠️ MKS already carries substantial debt, and allocating more cash to dividends rather than faster deleveraging may leave the company more exposed in a cyclical downturn.\n🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow at a strong rate, which, if achieved, could support both the higher dividend and ongoing debt reduction.\n🎁 Earnings recently grew at a very large rate, which may give management confidence that cash generation can support a higher payout to shareholders.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on how MKS balances its higher dividend with debt reduction and interest coverage. Updates on free cash flow, margin trends and progress on lowering interest expense will be important to judge whether the payout remains comfortable through different phases of the semiconductor cycle, especially against peers like Applied Materials, Lam Research and KLA. Any changes to the dividend policy or leverage targets, along with commentary on future cash priorities, will be useful markers for how management is weighing growth investment against shareholder returns.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for MKS, head to the community page for MKS to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "【王智立專欄】台積電日本合資公司（JASM)，是加分！？ 專欄作家王智立\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午8:26\n\n先說結論，短多長空！\n\n台積電 在蛇年股市封關創下歷史新高，市值來到49.66兆台幣（美國ADR更接近2兆美元）。\n\n台積電是做全世界的生意的：它的代工模式、經營效率、成本優勢等，在台灣生產是最佳解，它的市值創新高已證明了Made in Taiwan的優越性。\n\n「橘逾淮為枳」的道理你我都懂，去美國設廠是被架著脖子去的。美國的效率、成本、環保、人才、政府配套等因素較不利是事實。只是MAGA當道，加上美中對抗的地緣角力，台積電不得不從。\n\n那麼請問到日本設廠，台積電圖的又是什麼？先前熊本一廠是為了大客戶需求（Sony, 12/16 nm & 22/28 nm），熊本二廠原本規劃為汽車、工業、醫療、及物聯網(6/7 nm)。而如今直接升級成3奈米是爲了全球AI的大爆發。但日本的AI晶片設計和現有的AI企業在那裡？或許有幾家有潛力的公司，自駕車、機器人等，但真的需要在日本建一座可達經濟規模的3奈米晶圓廠嗎？還是可利用在台灣不斷擴建的先進產能，隨著美國Arizona 廠未來的3奈米產能持續開出，台灣的高階產能應該足夠支撐日本的需求吧！\n\n當然，另一個可能是（萬一）台海兵兇戰危，美國設廠製造的推進又不如預期（莫非定律？），台積電現階段投入在日本的先進製程或可為美國AI的領先地位買份保險？！\n\n與美國相比，日本做半導體的相關條件都和台灣更相近。把三奈米廠設在熊本，剛好教會日本所欠缺而台積電累積多年的經驗：怎麼改善良率、怎麼做先進製程/先進封裝、還有怎麼從日本半導體過往做IDM的慣性改做「晶圓代工Foundry」，這才是日本政府願意出大錢合資JASM的最重要原因！\n\n半導體製程所需的設備和材料（日本也是領跑人），全世界都一樣（除了中國現在被管制得另外想辦法），但為什麼只有台積電利用同樣的設備和材料，能做得出來最先進/高良率的產品？這是台灣半導體真正的核心競爭力！\n\n台積電搬到美國，有水土不合與文化差異的問題。同時，如果也找不到一流且敬業的人才願意到Arizona做半導體生產（為什麼不去Nvidia、Apple 或那麼多生活/工作環境更好的AI公司上班呢？）。基於這些落差，美國想要學會台積電在台灣深耕的真本事，非常不容易（初始階段不也都是靠台灣派去的幾千個工程師嗎？）\n\n日本就不一樣！\n\n文化相近、做事態度相通、高階人才相似，台積電到熊本示範怎麼做好3奈米，就等於把台灣原本私藏的看家本領拿到日本的合資公司手把手地做示範教學。\n\n日本自14奈米以下，過去這10年就再也沒有做過最先進半導體製程。最近幾年在北海道的Rapidus想要技術跳躍，將日本的半導體製造能力從14奈米直接切入到2奈米，這個難度非常高。更何況，使用技術來自IBM 的2奈米和TSMC的2奈米是很不一樣的。\n\n比如說，研發實驗室產品 vs. 大規模量產製程，這是兩者最大的本質區別。IBM 2奈米屬於「概念驗證」或「實驗室成果」。IBM 本身已經沒有工廠，它在 2021 年發布的是在實驗室環境下製造出來的樣品。它更像是一份食譜，證明這種結構是可行的。\n\n而台積電 3/2奈米 (N3/N2)是「商用量產製程」。台積電必須考慮的是如何每個月穩定產出幾萬片晶圓，且良率要高到客戶（如 Apple, NVIDIA）能賺錢。台積電的 3/2奈米是具備實際生產工具與產線的工藝。\n\n而各家廠商對「奈米」的命名標準是自主決定的，通常是一種「市場行銷名詞」，用來對標前一代產品的效能提升幅度。IBM 宣稱其 2奈米晶片每平方毫米可容納約 3.33 億個電晶體。而專家分析（比如 SemiWiki）指出，IBM 的 2奈米在電晶體密度上，其實比較接近台積電的 3奈米（N3）水平。\n\n台積電在日本的3奈米投資將直接授於日本最欠缺的先進製程、良率提升、工廠管理的know-how、及生態鏈的建立。請問將來JASM的離職員工能夠一個一個去告嗎？在日本的法律框架下，告得贏嗎？（即對於離職後「競業禁止（競業避止義務）」與憲法保障之「職業選擇自由」的拿捏）。更何況，不同於其在美國亞利桑那工廠的獨資，日本熊本廠還是一個與日本政府合資公司，官司訴訟將變得非常複雜！\n\n「短多長空」是筆者對決策者的善意提醒，希望它是錯的！",

      "Content": "AMD Just Announced a Huge Turnaround. Is It a Buy?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has been a great stock to own since 2025. Its stock is up around 60% since then, outperforming Nvidia over the same time frame. Up until a few days ago, AMD's stock was up over 100% during the same time frame, but it cratered after the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nIf I presented you the numbers, you may question why the sell-off occurred in the first place, as it looks like AMD has started the turnaround it told investors about months ago. Is this your buying opportunity? Or should you stay patient for a deeper decline?\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAMD's data center sales are accelerating One thing that has held AMD back during the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is its lack of focus on AI. Unlike Nvidia, which gets around 90% of its revenue from data center sales, AMD is more evenly spread out. During Q4 2025, 52% of sales came from data center revenue, while 38% came from its client and gaming division, and another 9% came from its embedded process division (totals don't add up to 100% due to rounding errors). Because AMD isn't as leveraged to data center sales, it isn't participating as much during one of the biggest technological shifts we've ever seen with generative AI .\n\nHowever, AMD is starting to increase its data center growth rate.\nDuring Q4 2025, its data center revenue increased at a 39% year-over-year pace. That's solid acceleration from Q3 2025's 22% growth rate, and Q4 could be the quarter that we look back on as the turning point for AMD. However, this is a small growth rate compared to what management thinks it will get to. Furthermore, sales to China are starting to return now that the Trump administration is starting to allow exports there again. This will be a solid boost throughout 2026 and beyond.\nBack in November, AMD released five-year guidance regarding each of its business units. During that release, it told investors that they could expect a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the data center division and a 10% CAGR for the other two. Combined, that would lead to a 35% CAGR companywide through 2030. While AMD fell slightly short of those projections during Q4, it still did an excellent job and is showing greater progress toward meeting those goals.\n\nBut why did AMD's stock slip?\nAMD's stock was expensive entering the quarter Before the sell-off, AMD's stock was trading for nearly 40 times forward earnings; now it trades for about 31.\n\nStory Continues\nConsidering AMD's track record and relative growth rate, there was no reason for AMD's stock to be valued that high, so a pullback was due. Furthermore, rival Nvidia trades for just 24 times forward earnings despite a greater market share and a stronger growth rate. So, to call AMD's stock cheap here is a fallacy, in my opinion.\n\nStill, I think it could deliver strong growth moving forward, especially if its data center division's revenue growth accelerates toward that 60% growth figure management guided for last year. For 2026, Wall Street analysts expect 34% revenue growth, and in 2027, that figure rises to 37%. Both of those are in line with the 35% overall CAGR management expects to deliver, so the analyst community believes that AMD can deliver on its promise.\nI'm still more bullish on Nvidia than I am AMD, but I think AMD is a worthy buy at this point in time as an alternative pick in the AI space. The AI build-out is far from over, and AMD could still deliver impressive growth despite missing out on the initial stages.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Deepens AI Inference Push With Groq Deal And Rubin Platform\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\nMU\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nNvidia agreed to acquire Groq's AI inference chip assets for $20b, aiming to expand its position in AI deployment hardware.\nThe company introduced its new Rubin chip platform, designed around next generation memory technology for inference workloads.\nSamsung and Micron are set to supply HBM4 memory for Nvidia's new GPU platforms, signaling changes in its component supply chain.\nRecent U.S. policy signals on legacy AI chip exports to China may affect how Nvidia serves that market.\n\nNVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) enters this phase of product and deal news with a share price of $186.94 and a one year return of 38.2%. Over the past week, the stock is up 8.8%, while the year to date return sits at a 1.0% decline, reflecting some recent volatility.\nFor you as an investor, the Groq acquisition and Rubin launch are mainly about where Nvidia wants to compete as AI usage shifts toward real world applications. Memory partnerships and evolving China export rules add extra moving parts that could influence demand, pricing power, and how its product roadmap plays out, all of which are worth watching alongside the share price.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for NVIDIA by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on NVIDIA.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 4 things going right for NVIDIA that every investor should see.\nNvidia’s $20b move for Groq’s inference assets and the Rubin platform launch point to a clear push beyond training GPUs into AI-inference specific hardware. That fits with what you are seeing elsewhere in the business, from distributed inference trials with Prologis and EPRI at utility-adjacent micro data centers to heavier use of Nvidia’s Isaac and BioNeMo platforms in areas like warehouse autonomy and lab robotics. The announced use of Samsung and Micron HBM4 on upcoming GPUs ties Nvidia more tightly to key memory suppliers, which may help support Rubin and Vera Rubin ramps but could also concentrate supplier risk. On the policy side, signals that older Hopper-generation chips might see looser export treatment to China, while newer architectures stay tightly controlled, effectively segment Nvidia’s portfolio by region and performance tier. For you, the thread across these developments is that Nvidia is working to secure more of the inference stack, from edge sites to large AI factories, while juggling supply chain depth and export rules that can affect where and how quickly new products scale.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The NVIDIA Narrative The Groq acquisition, Rubin platform work and distributed inference partnerships support the narrative that Nvidia is leaning into an AI infrastructure supercycle that spans both training and inference across data centers and edge locations.\nGreater reliance on specific HBM4 suppliers and export segmentation between Blackwell or Rubin and older Hopper chips underscores narrative risks around supply chain fragility and geopolitical limits on total addressable market.\nThe focus on inference specific hardware and micro data centers, as well as physical AI in labs and factories, extends the story into use cases that are not fully captured by a training centric view of AI data center growth.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NVIDIA to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Tighter links to a handful of HBM4 suppliers may expose Nvidia to component shortages or pricing pressure if memory capacity becomes constrained or terms change.\n⚠️ Export rules that keep the latest Blackwell and Rubin chips out of China could cap growth in that market and push some large customers toward domestic or alternative accelerators from peers like AMD or in house silicon.\n🎁 The Groq asset purchase and Rubin inference focus give Nvidia more product depth against inference competitors such as AMD and custom ASIC providers, which can help support its position across the AI stack.\n🎁 Memory partnerships with Samsung and Micron, plus work on distributed inference sites, can help Nvidia stay aligned with where AI workloads are heading, from large training clusters to latency sensitive edge deployments.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, it is worth watching how quickly Nvidia integrates Groq’s technology into shipping inference products and whether Rubin based systems gain traction with cloud providers and large enterprises. The terms and volumes associated with Samsung and Micron HBM4 supply will be important signals for how smoothly future GPU ramps can proceed. On the policy side, any concrete rules around legacy Hopper exports to China, compared with continuing restrictions on newer architectures, will help clarify how much of Nvidia’s portfolio can serve that market. Together, these factors will influence how balanced Nvidia’s AI exposure is between training and inference, and how diversified its demand and supply chains remain.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NVIDIA, head to the community page for NVIDIA to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "US, Taiwan finalise deal to cut tariffs, boost purchases of US goods\n\nBy David Lawder\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:54 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CL=F\n\nTSM\n\nBy David Lawder\nWASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Trump administration officials signed a final reciprocal trade agreement that confirmed a 15% U.S. tariff rate for imports from Taiwan, while committing Taiwan to a schedule for eliminating or lowering tariffs ‌on nearly all U.S. goods.\nThe document released by the U.S. Trade Representative's office on Thursday also commits Taiwan to ‌significantly boost purchases of U.S. goods from 2025 through 2029, including $44.4 billion of liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $15.2 billion of civil aircraft and engines, $25.2 billion of ​power grid equipment and generators, marine and steelmaking equipment.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nWhat investments did Taiwan commit to U.S. manufacturing?\n\nHow much will Taiwan purchase in U.S. goods?\n\nWhat tariff rates did the U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement establish?\n\nHow will this agreement affect U.S.-Taiwan trade deficit?\n\nThe agreement adds technical language and specific details to a trade framework deal first reached in January that cut tariffs on Taiwanese goods, including from its powerhouse semiconductor industries, to 15% from the 20% initially imposed by Trump. That puts Taiwan on an equal footing with its closest Asian export competitors, South Korea and Japan.\n\"This is a pivotal moment for Taiwan's ‌economy and industries to ride the winds of ⁠change and undergo a major transformation,\" Taiwan President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page.\nIt will optimize the Taiwan–U.S. economic and trade framework, build trustworthy industrial supply chains and establish a Taiwan–U.S. high-tech strategic ⁠partnership, he added.\nTaiwan also won exemptions from reciprocal tariffs for more than 2,000 product items exported to the United States, meaning the average tariff on U.S. exports will drop to 12.33%, Lai said.\n\nThe deal will need approval by Taiwan's parliament, where the opposition has a majority.\nINVESTMENT PLEDGE\nThe January ​agreement ​included a pledge by Taiwan that its companies would invest $250 billion to ​boost production of semiconductors, energy and artificial intelligence in ‌the U.S., including $100 billion already committed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. The Taiwan government would guarantee another $250 billion in U.S. investments, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\nThe final language did not provide further details on those investments, but said Taiwan's representative office in the U.S. would collaborate with U.S. authorities to facilitate additional new greenfield and brownfield investments \"in strategic high-technology manufacturing sectors, including AI, semiconductors, and advanced electronics.\"\nThe deal will immediately eliminate Taiwan's tariffs of up to 26% on many U.S. agricultural imports, including beef, dairy and corn. But ‌some tariffs, including the current 40% tariff on pork belly and 32% on ​ham, will only fall to 10%, according to the tariff schedule.\n\nStory Continues\nThe U.S. said ​under the deal, Taiwan will remove non-tariff barriers on ​motor vehicles and accept U.S. auto safety standards as well as those on medical devices and pharmaceuticals.\nU.S. ‌Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement that the ​agreement will boost export opportunities ​for U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen, workers, and manufacturers.\n\n\"This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,\" Greer added.\nFor the first 11 months ​of 2025, the U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan ‌ballooned to $126.9 billion from $73.7 billion for all of 2024, largely due to the large increase in imports of high-end ​AI chips from Taiwan, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard ​in Taipei; Editing by Anna Driver, Jamie Freed and Stephen Coates)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:42 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nGot some idle money you're ready to put to work for a while? Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nQualcomm Qualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\nRemitly PayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nStory Continues\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\nThe Trade Desk Finally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "Lumentum Holdings (LITE) Is Up 15.7% After AI-Driven Beat And Revenue Guidance Hike - What's Changed\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:12 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: LITE\n\nLumentum Holdings recently reported second-quarter 2026 results showing sales of US$665.5 million versus US$402.2 million a year earlier, and moved from a net loss of US$60.9 million to net income of US$78.2 million, alongside guidance for third-quarter net revenue of US$780 million to US$830 million.\nManagement highlighted that demand tied to AI data center buildouts, including a backlog above US$400 million in optical circuit switches and a multi-hundred-million-dollar co-packaged optics order for delivery in 2027, is increasingly shaping Lumentum’s revenue visibility.\nWe’ll now examine how this AI-driven backlog strength and upgraded revenue outlook affect Lumentum’s existing investment narrative and risk profile.\n\nUncover the next big thing with 27 elite penny stocks that balance risk and reward.\nLumentum Holdings Investment Narrative Recap To own Lumentum, you need to believe that its optical and photonic products will remain central to AI data center spending, and that it can turn today’s hyperscaler demand and backlog into durable, profitable revenue. The latest quarter’s move back into profitability and strong Q3 guidance appear to reinforce the near term AI demand catalyst, but also sharpen the main risk: heavy reliance on a few large cloud customers and the execution challenge of expanding capacity without eroding margins.\nThe most relevant recent announcement is Lumentum’s guidance for third quarter fiscal 2026 net revenue of US$780 million to US$830 million, which follows a quarter of sharply higher sales and a return to positive earnings. This outlook ties directly to AI driven orders in optical circuit switches and co packaged optics, and it sits at the center of the current debate about whether today’s AI backlog represents a sustainable multi year growth driver or a shorter lived spike in demand.\n\nYet beneath the strong guidance, investors should be aware that concentration in a handful of hyperscale customers still leaves Lumentum exposed if...\nRead the full narrative on Lumentum Holdings (it's free!)\nLumentum Holdings' narrative projects $3.1 billion revenue and $389.1 million earnings by 2028. This requires 23.4% yearly revenue growth and a $363.2 million earnings increase from $25.9 million today.\nUncover how Lumentum Holdings' forecasts yield a $348.38 fair value , a 40% downside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the most cautious analysts were assuming about US$2.7 billion of revenue and US$275.8 million of earnings by 2028, so compared with your focus on customer concentration risk, their narrative leans much more pessimistic about how easily today’s AI optics excitement could cool, and this latest earnings surprise may well prompt them to revisit those assumptions.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 12 other fair value estimates on Lumentum Holdings - why the stock might be worth less than half the current price!\nBuild Your Own Lumentum Holdings Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "Why This Tech Stock's Recent Dip Could Be a Buying Opportunity\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 4:56 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SNDK\n\nWDC\n\nSandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) has been one of the hottest stocks in the market, but a 14% pullback from highs hit in early February could be a buying opportunity. And despite its recent highs, the stock is still not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and just over 7.5 times fiscal 2027 estimates.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nSandisk's performance is no flash in the pan The company is a leading producer of NAND storage devices, or flash memory. It is one of the few pure-play ways to invest in this segment of the tech market after the company was spun off from Western Digital about a year ago. NAND has been a very cyclical market over the years, but the space looks like it is at the beginning of what appears to be a long-lasting supercycle.\nIt was only a few years ago that the NAND market was in complete disarray. After seeing huge demand for electronics stemming from the pandemic, memory makers overbuilt production, causing a huge oversupply in the market that led prices to crash. Things became so bad that NAND gross margins turned negative.\n\nThis disarray led many memory makers to hugely cut NAND production and redirect their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory). At the same time, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized form of DRAM, began to take off because of its importance in helping optimize the performance of graphics processing units when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. HBM comes with strong unit economics, but it needs huge wafer capacity, so it began eating up memory maker resources.\nRising prices add another tailwind for Sandisk Soon after, AI data centers also started to need huge, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use NAND to help store training data. With production slashed and demand now suddenly surging, flash memory prices have been skyrocketing because there is now a huge NAND shortage. Given the economics and demand for HBM, along with growing demand for NAND, these market dynamics are unlikely to shift anytime in the near future.\nWith flash memory in short supply, Sandisk continues to benefit from increased prices, which are also dramatically lifting its gross margins and profits. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 61%, while its gross margins expanded from 32.3% a year ago to 50.9%, leading its adjusted earnings per share to surge fivefold.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the NAND market going from a cyclical business to a structural growth story on the back of AI data centers, Sandisk finds itself in an enviable position. And with the boom in AI infrastructure spending, the company is set to see huge growth ahead. This makes the recent dip a buying opportunity.\n\nShould you buy stock in Sandisk right now? Before you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Atomera Q4 Earnings Call Highlights\n\nMarketBeat\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 4:27 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ATOM\n\nTSM\n\nSSNLF\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points MST shows definitive proof for Gate-All-Around (GAA): Atomera reported successful deposition into nanosheet structures and superior diffusion-blocking at ~2nm versus silicon-arsenic, and has a strategic partnership with a large equipment OEM while targeting major foundries (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, Rapidus) with potential commercial deals in 2026.\nBroad application progress across multiple markets: Atomera is advancing wafer-based MST efforts in DRAM (promising preliminary wafer results that could lead to a JDA and production license), RF SOI, power (trench FET simulations suggesting >40% performance gains), and GaN, where its first commercial customer has begun running MST GaN-on-silicon wafers.\nWeak near-term financials and limited cash runway: 2025 revenue was only $65,000 with a GAAP net loss of $20.2M and cash down to $19.2M after ATM sales (≈$7.6M in 2025 and an additional ~$3.2M post-year-end); Q1 revenue is expected at $50k–$100k and 2026 non-GAAP operating expense is targeted at about $18.5M.\nInterested in Atomera Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAtomera (NASDAQ:ATOM) used its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 update call to outline recent technical progress across several semiconductor markets, with management repeatedly framing 2025 as a setup year for commercial execution and potential deal announcements later in 2026.\nGate-All-Around results lift confidence in adoption timeline CEO Scott Bibaud spent much of his prepared remarks and Q&A emphasizing progress in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor technology, which he described as foundational for AI-related chips such as GPUs, CPUs, and advanced networking components. Atomera recently announced a strategic partnership with a “large equipment OEM,” and Bibaud said the target customers for GAA adoption include TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Japan’s Rapidus.\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\nBibaud said Atomera’s MST technology is positioned as a diffusion-blocking solution for high phosphorus doping levels in GAA source and drain regions. He said a key manufacturing challenge is preventing phosphorus dopants from migrating into the channel, which can significantly impact performance, efficiency, and yield.\n\nAccording to Bibaud, Atomera’s target customers wanted two proof points for manufacturability at around 2 nanometers:\nThat MST can be deposited effectively into nanosheet structures.\nThat MST’s diffusion-blocking characteristics outperform other industry approaches.\n→ No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\n\nStory Continues\nBibaud said the company obtained “very exciting silicon results” in both areas in the prior month and believes these results provide “definitive proof” to drive broader adoption in the future. He added that MST can be deposited using existing tools and standard gases and described it as “far superior” to current diffusion blocking materials used by the industry.\n\nIn response to analyst Richard Shannon of Craig-Hallum, Bibaud said the company’s increased confidence is tied to having recent test data that addresses the customer concerns around both deposition into very small structures and diffusion blocking efficacy in those structures. He said Atomera has been working with one GAA customer to access the necessary wafers and structures, and he expressed a goal of expanding engagement to all four major GAA customers.\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\nWhen asked about alternatives, Bibaud pointed to silicon arsenic as a prior industry approach, calling it more of a spacer than an effective diffusion blocker. He said Atomera has tested MST against silicon arsenic and found “vastly better” diffusion blocking performance. He also said the industry prefers to avoid arsenic when possible because it is “expensive to use and dangerous.”\n\nUpdates across DRAM, RF SOI, power, and GaN Beyond GAA, management discussed multiple application areas where Atomera is pursuing what it calls “wafer-based” solutions—an approach Bibaud said can reduce integration engineering complexity by placing MST on a blank wafer before the customer begins the rest of its manufacturing process.\nDRAM: Bibaud said DRAM architectures are reaching an inflection point as the industry increases use of the vertical dimension. Atomera is working on offerings aimed at next-generation DRAM architectures, alongside solutions for products currently in production. He cited two “major solution offerings” with high market potential that are wafer-based and therefore “easier to adopt and test.” Bibaud said Atomera is conducting many wafer runs, mostly processing through customer fabs. One customer has preliminary results that “look promising,” with final data expected in about a month; if results are positive, Bibaud said Atomera would push for a joint development agreement and a production license.\n\nRF SOI: Bibaud said Atomera’s RF SOI solution can improve multiple areas, including RF switches and low noise amplifiers (LNA). He said the company is working with “many of the key players” and hopes to drive broad adoption. He also said customers could deposit MST themselves on wafers or potentially source RF SOI MST wafers from third-party suppliers, with Atomera’s license structure supporting both models.\nPower: Bibaud said Atomera continues to work with ST on MST solutions across multiple business units despite a prior-year setback. He also said there has been inbound interest for additional power applications. He highlighted internal analysis suggesting MST could improve trench FET performance by more than 40% in simulations, describing trench FETs as important for energy efficiency in AI data centers. Bibaud said a customer was already interested in beginning development based on the post-Christmas simulation result. He also discussed MSTcad simulations showing MST can improve HBT devices used in RF communication systems and said discussions were underway with a potential first customer.\n\nIn Q&A, Bibaud described power as a larger and more diverse market than RF SOI and said Atomera is expanding engagement but is not working with “the vast majority” of power players.\nGaN: Bibaud said Atomera’s first commercial customer has begun running wafers for GaN-on-silicon with MST. He said this customer can both grow GaN wafers and manufacture electrical devices, which could allow it to move faster than Atomera’s internal development work with Sandia National Labs and Texas State. He added the customer is exploring GaN in both RF and power technologies.\nBibaud also noted Atomera’s GaN-on-silicon concept paper was approved to move to the proposal stage for a PowerAmerica project aimed at advancing wide bandgap materials. He said the company had received letters of support from multiple future customers and framed the effort as its first attempt to secure outside development funding, describing the initial funding sought as “modest” but potentially opening pathways for future funding opportunities.\n\nFinancial results: modest revenue, continued losses, cash decline CFO Frank Laurencio said 2025 revenue was $65,000, consisting of NRE fees for wafer deliveries and MSTcad licensing. GAAP net loss for 2025 was $20.2 million, or $0.65 per share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $18.4 million, or $0.68 per share, in 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, 2025 net loss was $16.1 million, or $0.52 per share, versus $15.4 million, or $0.57 per share, in 2024.\nGAAP operating expenses were $20.9 million in 2025, up about $1.5 million from $19.3 million in 2024, driven mainly by a $1.1 million increase in stock compensation tied to changes in executive equity-based compensation. Laurencio said Atomera implemented performance stock units (PSUs) in Q1 2025 that vest based on stock price performance versus the Russell 2000 Index.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses were $15.9 million in 2025, up $429,000 from 2024. Laurencio said R&D expenses rose to $10.2 million from $9.4 million, primarily due to increased outsourced engineering as Atomera used new device fabrication vendors, replacing TSI Semiconductors. He said GaN expenses fell to $4.8 million from $5.1 million, mainly due to lower compensation expense, partially offset by higher professional fees.\nCash usage, ATM activity, and near-term revenue outlook Atomera ended 2025 with $19.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, down from $26.7 million at the end of 2024. Laurencio said the company used $14.9 million in cash from operating activities during 2025, including $3.2 million in Q4.\nDuring 2025, Atomera sold about 1.6 million shares through its at-the-market (ATM) facility at an average price of $5.15 per share, generating net proceeds of about $7.6 million after costs. The company ended the year with 32.4 million shares outstanding. After year-end, Laurencio said Atomera raised an additional $3.2 million in net proceeds by selling about 1.3 million shares at an average price of $2.47.\n\nFor Q1, Laurencio said Atomera expects to recognize revenue in the range of $50,000 to $100,000 from shipment of MST wafers to customers, and reiterated the company does not provide revenue guidance beyond the current quarter.\nLooking to 2026, Laurencio said Atomera intends to control costs while investing in areas tied to revenue and near-term commercial progress, including adding a head of marketing following the hiring of a VP of sales in October. The company expects non-GAAP operating expense of approximately $18.5 million in 2026, though Laurencio said the year-over-year comparison is affected by the potential payout and accrual timing of executive bonuses that were withheld in 2025.\nIn closing comments, Bibaud said the “entire focus” of Atomera’s efforts is reaching commercial agreements and that the company believes its 2025 work has positioned it to close opportunities, with updates expected as the year progresses.\n\nAbout Atomera (NASDAQ:ATOM) Atomera Inc is a materials engineering company that develops and licenses advanced thin film technologies for the semiconductor industry.

      "Content": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nGeoffrey Seiler\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:57 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market is continuing to boom, and this is still a great place to look to invest. Let's look at two AI stocks that investors can buy now and hold for the next decade.\nundefined\nBroadcom One of the most exciting AI stocks to own right now for the long term is undoubtedly Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The AI infrastructure market is booming with no signs of let-up in sight. At the same time, data center networking is becoming more important as AI chip clusters grow, while there has also been a shift toward companies looking to create their own custom AI chips to save costs.\nAs the inference market eventually outpaces training over the coming decade, AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) should begin to take more share away from graphics processing units (GPUs ), which are currently the primary chips used to power AI workloads.\n\nThis is all great news for Broadcom. The company is a top player in data center networking, where its Tomahawk Ethernet switch is a leading solution within AI data centers. Meanwhile, the company helped Alphabet create its highly successful tensor processing units (TPUs), which look poised to become a huge growth driver as Alphabet aggressively builds out its AI infrastructure and starts letting customers use its chips for their AI workloads, as well. Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion TPU order to be delivered this year for use within Google Cloud. Meanwhile, other companies, including OpenAI, are also working with Broadcom to develop their own custom AI chips.\nBetween networking and custom AI chips, Broadcom has one of the biggest growth opportunities in the AI space over the next decade.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another huge beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company is the leading manufacturer of chips in the world, and it has a near monopoly on making advanced chips. As competitors have struggled with achieving high yields for advanced chips, TSMC has become the go-to partner for chip designers and is working in lock step with them to increase capacity to meet surging demand. Best of all, it benefits from both GPU and AI ASIC growth.\nTSMC's position in the industry has also given it strong pricing power, which has helped it boost its gross margins. According to reports, it has already informed customers of a four-year price hike schedule. Between boosting its capacity and price increase, TSMC looks poised to be a long-term winner in the AI infrastructure space.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "$10 Million Exit: Why a Fund Would Walk Away From CoreCivic Despite a $604 Million Quarter\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:36 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CXW\n\nGOOG\n\nTSEM\n\nCLF\n\n^GSPC\n\nTuriya Advisors Asia Ltd sold its entire position in CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) during the fourth quarter, according to a February 11 SEC filing, with an estimated transaction value of $9.75 million.\nWhat happened According to an SEC filing dated February 11, Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd reported selling all 479,000 shares of CoreCivic in the fourth quarter. The estimated transaction value was $9.75 million.\nWhat else to know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:GOOGL: $225.77 million (34.6% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:TSEM: $172.85 million (26.5% of AUM)\nNYSE:CLF: $96.28 million (14.7% of AUM)\nNYSE:GEO: $91.00 million (13.9% of AUM)\nNYSE:PSTG: $67.01 million (10.3% of AUM)\nAs of February 11, shares of CoreCivic were priced at $18.50, up 2.5% over the past year and underperforming the S&P 500 by 11.8 percentage points.\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close February 11, 2026)\n$18.50\nMarket capitalization\n$1.98 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$2.09 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$109.24 million\n\nCompany snapshot CoreCivic, Inc. operates correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, and provides government real estate solutions across the United States.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through long-term contracts with government agencies for facility management, rehabilitation programs, and property leasing.\nIts main customers are federal, state, and local government entities seeking corrections, detention, and reentry services.\nCoreCivic, Inc. is a leading U.S. provider of partnership correctional and detention management services, with a diversified portfolio spanning safety, community reentry, and real estate segments. The company leverages its scale and experience to deliver secure facility operations and rehabilitation programs for government partners. Its integrated service offerings and long-term contracts support stable cash flows and position CoreCivic as a key player in the specialty REIT sector.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors When a concentrated portfolio reallocates capital away from a government services operator that just posted $604.0 million in quarterly revenue and $26.5 million in fourth quarter net income, it likely signals positioning, not necessarily pessimism.\n\nCoreCivic grew full-year 2025 revenue to $2.2 billion and net income to $116.5 million, with normalized funds from operations per diluted share of $2.05. Management expects 2026 net income between $147.5 million and $157.5 million and EBITDA as high as $445.0 million. That is not a business in retreat.\n\nFor a portfolio already heavily weighted toward cyclical and policy-sensitive names like Cleveland-Cliffs and GEO Group, trimming or exiting another corrections exposure may simply reduce thematic overlap or open up opportunities for targeted bets in other names. CoreCivic’s leverage of 2.8 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and expanding credit facility provide flexibility, but the stock still carries headline and regulatory risk.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in CoreCivic right now? Before you buy stock in CoreCivic, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CoreCivic wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Morgan Stanley tweaks Micron stock price target as pressure builds\n\nMoz Farooque\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nSSNLF\n\nMicron ( MU ) stock just got another major nod of approval from Wall Street , and the timing is telling.\nShares of the popular memory maker are up 10% over the past week, and Morgan Stanley sees even more upside, raising its price target to $450 from $350 while reiterating an overweight rating.\nThe bullishness stems from the fact that memory pricing power continues to go from strength to strength.\n\nMicron and other memory makers have been on a killer run as AI infrastructure spending rises at an exponential pace. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) has become mission-critical for AI accelerators, and supply has struggled to keep pace.\nMicron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra discussed AI’s insatiable demand for memory during a recent CNBC interview at Davos.\nAnd AI’s relentless appetite for memory isn’t slowing down anytime soon, per Seeking Alpha and according to Samsung Electronics CTO Song Jai-hyuk .\nSpeaking at Semicon Korea 2026, he said that AI-linked infrastructure demand should remain strong through at least 2027, with the tech titan ramping up mass production of its sixth-generation HBM4 chips.\n“ Memory and packaging are no longer supporting roles ,” said Clark Tseng of Semi, a semiconductor research and analysis outfit. “They are now critical to how fast AI infrastructure can scale .”\n\nAdditionally, Lenovo said memory costs jumped 40% to 50% in the past quarter and could double in the current one.\nThat’s exactly the setup that’s pushing Micron stock to record highs, up 44% year to date , despite broader market sluggishness.\nThe ongoing AI infrastructure buildout is expanding rapidly, positioning Micron well for the remainder of the year.\nWhere Wall Street sees Micron stock heading next Micron is trading at $410.34 (as of Feb. 12, 2026).\nMorgan Stanley: $450 (+9.7%) UBS: $450 (+9.7%) Deutsche Bank: $500 (+21.9%) Wells Fargo: $410 (-0.1%) Citigroup: $385 (-6.2%)\nMorgan Stanley sees pricing power getting stronger, not weaker Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore is making the case that, despite the eye-opening run in DRAM over the past year, the cycle is only tightening.\n“As much as happened in the last 12 months in DRAM, we remain excited for what's ahead,” he wrote. The key element to consider at this point is supply, or rather, the lack of it.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nThe numbers back up the bullishness:\nDDR5 spot pricing up 30% YTD\nSpot prices are 130% above January contract levels (up 86% from December).\nMainstream pricing could double again while still sitting at more than 10% below spot.\nASPs could approach the high-teens per GB.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s tremendous pricing leverage.\nMoreover, Moore now expects Micron to earn as much as $52 per share in 2026 , speahreaded by HBM demand tied to Nvidia . “ HBM is certainly a key part of the story here ,” he noted, but added that DDR5 pricing alone is now “ a much more attractive market right now .”\nMicron is smaller in HBM, but the gap is narrowing AI accelerators have been gobbling up HBM, and businesses that can efficiently ship product at scale continue to win over investor confidence.\nAt this point, though, the scoreboard in the memory space is clear.\nIn DRAM, SK hynix leads the charge with 33.2% market share , followed by Samsung at 32.6% , with Micron at 25.7% .\nIn HBM, which is the critical part for AI GPUs, the gap is wider.\nRelated: Top analyst revamps Apple stock price target\nSK hynix currently dominates with a 53% market share , Samsung holds 35% , and Micron trails at 11% .\n\nIn NAND, Samsung leads at 32.3% , SK hynix follows at 19.3% .\nSo clearly, SK hynix is the stand-out company that’s dominating the HBM scene and will likely capture the bulk of Nvidia’s early Rubin volume. Also, Samsung is moving aggressively to ramp HBM4 shipments and close the gap.\nAt the same time, despite Micron being a much smaller player in HBM, it’s ramping HBM4 and benefiting from the broader memory crunch.\nIt’s important to note that Micron is already in high-volume production on HBM4, having sold out its 2026 supply.\nMicron stock crushes the S&P 500 across every major time frame YTD: Micron +43.77% versus S&P 500 +1.40%\n1-year: Micron +336.16% versus S&P 500 +14.38%\n3-year: Micron +585.96% versus S&P 500 +69.70%\n5-year: Micron +374.49% versus S&P 500 +77.24%\n10-year: Micron +4,134.67% versus S&P 500 +279.50%\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nRelated: JPMorgan doubles down on S&P 500 target for one key reason\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 12, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

At a time when investors have been stressed about the impact AI would have on competition, a less-than-impressive quarterly update from Cisco Systems, shares of which plummeted more than 12%, helped to sour the market on technology stocks broadly. Other sectors also got caught up in worries about AI disruption, says Brad Bernstein, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management. “I think what we're seeing today is more of what we've seen recently in the last week or two, that is a lot of volatility around the markets, shooting first, asking questions later on any news around AI disrupting any sector. And it's not just software that was a big cause recently of all the tech volatility. We are seeing it today show up in office commercial real estate. We saw it earlier this week in wealth management firms. So any news that may cause any disruptions in any sector is causing immediate sell-off, regardless of whether or not it actually will have any material impact in any of these companies that are selling off.” Shares of Applovin were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 software index, tumbling more than 19%, despite beating market estimates for fourth-quarter sales. But investors worried about signs of increasing competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Shares of logistics companies CH Robinson and Landstar and Expeditors International both saw double-digit percentage declines after CNBC reported that a new tool from AI company Algorhythm Holdings made trucking companies the latest target of investor worries about AI disruption. But shares of Equinix rallied more than 10% after the largest data-center operator forecast annual revenue above estimates, betting on strong AI-linked demand. After the stronger-than-expected jobs report earlier this week, investors now look to the January Consumer Price Index for the latest inflation data. The report is due on Friday.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The estimated transaction value was $38.60 million based on the average closing price during the fourth quarter of 2025.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late To Consider Sandisk (SNDK) After Its Surging 2024 Share Price?\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:15 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SNDK\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nIf you are wondering whether Sandisk’s current share price lines up with its underlying worth, this article walks through what the numbers say about value.\nThe stock last closed at US$630.29, with returns of 9.4% over 7 days, 61.7% over 30 days and 129.0% year to date, while the 1-year return is very large.\nRecent headlines around Sandisk have focused on its role in storage technology and broader interest in tech names, giving extra attention to a stock that has already moved sharply. This context matters for anyone trying to understand whether the current price reflects fundamentals or more sentiment-driven trading.\nRight now, Sandisk scores 2 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by its valuation score . We will look at what different valuation approaches suggest and then finish with a simple way to bring this into one clearer view of value.\n\nSandisk scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Sandisk Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model looks at the cash Sandisk is expected to generate in the future and then discounts those projected cash flows back to today to estimate what the business might be worth right now.\nFor Sandisk, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $1.41b. Analysts and Simply Wall St then project cash flows out over the next decade using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with analyst estimates feeding into the earlier years and extrapolated figures used for the later period. For example, projected Free Cash Flow for 2028 is $11.98b, and the discounted values for the 2026 to 2035 stream of cash flows range from roughly $4.71b to $10.39b per year in present value terms.\n\nPulling those together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2,008.01 per share. Against the recent share price of US$630.29, this implies Sandisk trades at about a 68.6% discount. On these assumptions, the DCF view indicates that the stock is materially undervalued.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Sandisk is undervalued by 68.6%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 52 more high quality undervalued stocks .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Sandisk.\nApproach 2: Sandisk Price vs Sales For a business like Sandisk, where investors often focus on revenue potential, the P/S ratio is a useful way to compare what the market is paying for each dollar of sales. It sidesteps short term earnings swings and puts the spotlight on the top line.\n\nStory Continues\nIn general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/S multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more conservative range. So the key question is not just whether a multiple is high or low, but whether it fits the company’s profile.\nSandisk currently trades on a P/S ratio of 10.42x, which is well above the Tech industry average of 2.00x and above the peer group average of 4.98x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Sandisk is 8.80x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/S might be, given factors like Sandisk’s earnings, profit margins, risk profile, industry and market cap. Because it blends these company specific drivers, it can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry.\nComparing the current 10.42x P/S to the 8.80x Fair Ratio suggests Sandisk is trading above this fair value range.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

Discover our 23 top founder-led companies .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Sandisk Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, and on Simply Wall St that means building a Narrative, which is simply your story about Sandisk, linked to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins that roll up into a Fair Value you can compare to the current price on the Community page used by millions of investors.\nInstead of only relying on ratios or a single DCF output, a Narrative lets you say, for example, “I think Sandisk looks closer to the bearish case with revenue growing around 16.3% a year, margins at about 13.8% and earnings of roughly $1.7b by 2029, which implies a Fair Value near $157.81.” Or: “I am closer to the bullish view that lines up with earnings of about $5.7b by 2028 and a Fair Value of around $322.00.” You can then see in real time how new news or earnings updates shift those numbers and whether your Fair Value is above or below today’s share price.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Sandisk?

      "Content": "This $96 Million Steel Bet Signals Conviction in Cleveland-Cliffs Despite a $1.4 Billion Annual Loss\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:07 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CLF\n\nGOOG\n\nTSEM\n\nGEO\n\nPSTG\n\nTuriya Advisors Asia Ltd initiated a new position in Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) during the fourth quarter, acquiring 7,250,000 shares in a trade estimated at $96.28 million, according to a February 11 SEC filing.\nWhat happened According to an SEC filing dated February 11, Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd established a new position in Cleveland-Cliffs by purchasing 7,250,000 shares. The fund’s quarter-end stake was valued at $96.28 million.\nWhat else to know This was a new position, now comprising 14.75% of Turiya Advisors Asia Ltd’s 13F reportable assets under management as of December 31.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: GOOGL: $225.77 million (34.6% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSEM: $172.85 million (26.5% of AUM)\nNYSE: CLF: $96.28 million (14.8% of AUM)\nNYSE: GEO: $91.00 million (13.9% of AUM)\nNYSE: PSTG: $67.01 million (10.3% of AUM)\nAs of February 11, shares of Cleveland-Cliffs were priced at $12.48, up 10.4% over the prior year.\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 2/11/26)\n$12.48\nMarket Capitalization\n$7.12 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$18.61 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n($1.48 billion)\n\nCompany snapshot Cleveland-Cliffs produces flat-rolled steel, stainless steel, electrical steel, tinplate, tubular components, and hot-briquetted iron.\nThe company generates revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of steel products and value-added steel solutions for various industrial applications.\nIts main customers include automotive manufacturers, infrastructure and manufacturing firms, distributors, converters, and other steel producers across North America.\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc. is a leading North American steel producer with a vertically integrated business model, leveraging both steelmaking and iron ore mining assets. The company serves a diversified customer base, with significant exposure to the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Its scale, product breadth, and control over raw materials position it as a key supplier in the regional steel industry.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors This move creates a $96.28 million position that now accounts for 14.75% of reported assets, instantly making steel a core driver of portfolio performance in a heavily concentrated portfolio.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs just reported fourth-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, flat year over year, alongside a $235 million net loss and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $21 million. For the full year, revenue slipped to $18.6 billion from $19.2 billion, and net loss widened to $1.4 billion. Liquidity stood at $3.3 billion, and management is guiding for 2026 steel shipments of roughly 16.5 to 17.0 million net tons, with targeted unit cost reductions of about $10 per net ton.\n\nThat backdrop makes the allocation notable. This is a portfolio already concentrated in large technology names and cyclical plays, with over $225 million in Alphabet and nearly $173 million in Tower Semiconductor. Adding a nearly $100 million steel position alongside a $91 million stake in GEO tilts exposure toward economically sensitive assets.\n\nLong-term investors should focus less on quarterly losses and more on balance sheet flexibility, cost discipline, and whether improved trade dynamics and automotive demand can translate into sustained margin recovery. A position this large suggests the buyer believes the cycle is closer to a trough than a peak.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Cleveland-Cliffs right now? Before you buy stock in Cleveland-Cliffs, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cleveland-Cliffs wasn’t one of them.

However, the next phase of the AI race may not just be for a single winner. As demand shifts from GPUs to full-stack computing solutions such as CPUs, AI accelerators, and software ecosystems, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is emerging as a serious challenger.\n\nAMD entered 2025 with strong momentum and exited the year strengthening its case that it could be the next semiconductor winner. AMD stock has gained 85% in the past year, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) gain of 15%. So far this year, AMD stock is down roughly 4%.\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nLet's find out whether AMD stock is a good buy now on the dip.\nData Center and AI Represent AMD’s Growth Engine Valued at $348 billion, AMD designs high-performance processors and graphics chips used in data centers, personal computers, gaming consoles, and AI systems. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 34% year-over-year (YOY) to $10.3 billion, driven by record sales of EPYC server processors, Ryzen CPUs, and Instinct accelerators. Diluted earnings rose 40% YOY to $1.53 per share. The data center segment became the company's key growth engine. Q4 data center revenue climbed 39% YOY to $5.4 billion, driven by robust EPYC server processor demand and accelerated MI350 series GPU shipments. The adoption of fifth-generation EPYC Turin CPUs surged, “accounting for more than half of the total server revenue,” while fourth-generation EPYC processors remained in high demand.\n\nNotably, hyperscaler demand remained high, with over 230 new AMD-powered instances launched throughout the quarter. Over the course of the year, hyperscalers added more than 500 AMD-based instances, bringing the overall number of EPYC cloud instances up by more than 50% to nearly 1,600. Looking ahead, AMD anticipates continued high server demand as hyperscalers increase infrastructure to support AI and enterprises modernize data centers for emerging AI workflows. Additionally, the ramp of MI350 series shipments and additional MI308 sales to customers in China contributed to the growth of the data center AI business.\nOn the software side, AMD expanded the ROCm ecosystem, allowing for speedier deployment and better performance across a wider range of workloads. Management noted that customer interest in AMD's next-generation MI400 series and Helios platform is growing. Last quarter, AMD announced a multi-generational partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs. The company believes the launch of MI400 and Helios represents a major inflection point and expects data center revenue to grow more than 60% annually over the next three to five years, with AI revenue scaling to tens of billions of dollars annually by 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking ahead, AMD is also developing the MI500 series using the cDNA6 architecture and advanced two-nanometer process technology with HBM4e memory. AMD plans to release MI500 in 2027, aiming for another significant boost in AI performance for next-generation multimodal models.\nAMD’s Other Segments Are Going Equally Strong AMD’s Client segment revenue rose 34% to a record $3.1 billion, driven by strong demand across multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. Meanwhile, Gaming revenue increased 50% YOY to $843 million, supported by strong demand for Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs and higher channel sellout during the holiday period. AMD also launched FSR4 Redstone, its latest AI-powered upscaling technology.\nThe Embedded segment's revenue increased 3% YOY to $950 million as demand strengthened in the test and measurement and aerospace markets. AMD closed $17 billion in embedded design wins in 2025, bringing the total since acquiring Xilinx to more than $50 billion. The firm ended the quarter with a sturdy balance sheet holding $10.6 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor the full year, revenue grew 34% to $34.6 billion, with more than $7.6 billion added from data center and client revenue growth. Gross margin reached 52%, and EPS rose 26% YOY to $4.17, even as the company continued investing heavily in AI and data center initiatives.\n2026 and Beyond Could Be Exceptional AMD expects strong growth to continue into 2026, driven by increased adoption of EPYC CPUs, expanding Instinct deployments, continued client share gains, and a return to growth in embedded markets. For Q1 2026, the company expects revenue of around $9.8 billion (plus or minus $300 million), representing roughly 32% YOY growth at the midpoint.\nLooking further ahead, AMD sees revenue growth above a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three to five years, expanding operating margins, and annual EPS exceeding $20 within its strategic timeframe. Analysts forecast AMD’s earnings to increase by 60% in 2026, followed by another 58% in 2027. AMD stock is valued at 37.9 times forward earnings, compared to its historical average of 93 times.\n\nAMD’s expanding portfolio, from Helios AI infrastructure in the cloud to Ryzen processors powering edge and PC AI, positions the company to capture growth across the entire AI compute stack, making it a strong contender to Nvidia.\nIs AMD Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell Now? Overall, the consensus for AMD stock has changed from a “Moderate Buy” one month ago to a “Strong Buy” consensus now. Of the 45 analysts covering AMD, 31 rate it a “Strong Buy,” while two recommend a “Moderate Buy,” and 12 recommend a “Hold.” Based on the average price target of $288.54, analysts see potential upside of about 40% over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the high target of $380 implies a potential price increase of 84% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in February\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 1:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been hit hard in recent weeks. The market is growing skeptical about AI spending, but the reality is that it's still going strong. We've received news of what capital expenditures look like for many of the AI hyperscalers during 2026, and these record-setting numbers indicate one thing: The AI buildout is far from over.\n\nThis makes me bullish on a specific group of stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Both of these companies are poised to benefit from the massive amount of money being spent this year, and look like excellent buys right now as a result.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nHow much is being spent on AI? The three companies I want to focus on for capital expenditures spending amounts are Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms . All three of these companies are AI hyperscalers and are spending a ton on computing equipment for internal use and to rent out to customers via their cloud computing service.\nFor 2026, Amazon expects to spend $200 billion, Alphabet up to $185 billion, and Meta up to $135 billion. Combined, that's over $500 billion in capital expenditures. That's not including Microsoft , which is a major spender as well.\n\nThere are also several other companies spending billions of dollars on computing equipment that aren't even included on this list, so the reality is that AI spending is going to be as big as ever. While investors may be concerned that companies are spending too much on AI and should be concerned, that doesn't mean you should avoid investing in companies that are making money from AI right now, like Nvidia and Broadcom. Both of these are major computing unit suppliers and will make a boatload of money this year.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been the go-to AI computing units since the AI boom began in 2023. While Nvidia is seeing more challengers, it's still the top contender thanks to its full technology stack setup that allows end users to purchase everything they need from Nvidia.\n\nAnother company to watch is Broadcom. Instead of offering a GPU that can tackle a wide range of workloads, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to design a chip specifically meant for its needs. Alphabet and Broadcom have already collaborated to produce the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a wildly popular design. As Alphabet's capital expenditures soar, so will its TPU orders, boosting Broadcom's sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThere are also several other hyperscalers who are clients of Broadcom's, and each of them also expects to ramp up consumption of custom AI chips in an effort to diversify away from Nvidia's products.\nEach of these compaines is slated to benefit, but they're also just great buys in general right now.\n\nThese stocks rarely trade at these cheap valuations Wall Street analysts expect both Broadcom and Nvidia to deliver 52% revenue growth this fiscal year. That clearly indicates that the AI boom is far from over, yet the market isn't pricing in this success.\nNvidia is the cheaper of the two, trading for 24 times forward earnings. Broadcom is more expensive at 32 times forward earnings, but its success is far less predictable than Nvidia's due to its concentration with a handful of clients using its chip designs. I still think each of these AI stocks is worth investing in, although I do prefer Nvidia a tad more.\n\nWith the massive amount of money being spent on AI hardware from these three major players, Nvidia and Broadcom's stock should be rising, not falling. But that opposite is going on, so investors should use this opportunity to load up on two of the best growth stocks we've seen in years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "1 Lesser-Known Chip Stock to Snap Up ASAP\n\nFaisal Humayun Khan\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 1:16 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nAMZN\n\nThe global semiconductor industry appears to be going through structural tailwinds. Fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, global semiconductor industry annual sales are projected to touch $975 billion in 2026, a historic peak. Furthermore, with sustained growth, annual sales may touch $2 trillion by 2036.\n\nWith that in mind, it's unsurprising that semiconductor stocks have surged higher. While some investors might have missed out on the big rally, there also still seem to be pockets of opportunity left. Amid volatility, shares of STMicroelectronics (STM) have trended 43% higher in the last 52 weeks. This lesser-known chip stock seems to hold significant potential.\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\nPfizer Reports Strong Earnings Outlook - Unusual Call Options Activity Shows Investors are Bullish\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nSTMicroelectronics recently announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS), and this multi-billion-dollar collaboration underscores the point of scope for value creation. As part of the deal, STM will be a supplier of advanced semiconductor technologies and products to AWS. Further, STM will issue warrants to AWS for up to 24.8 million shares. Besides establishing credibility, this deal is likely to be a top-line growth driver for STMicroelectronics and STM stock.\n\nAbout STM Stock Based in the Netherlands and headquartered in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of semiconductor products globally. The company’s key business segments include RF & Optical Communications, Analog Products, MEMS & Sensors, Embedded Processing, and Power & Discrete Products. In terms of end users, the automotive, industrial and personal electronics segments are business growth drivers for the company.\nFor fiscal 2025, STMicroelectronics reported revenue of $11.8 billion with a gross margin of 33.9%. For the same period, the firm reported free cash flow of $265 million.\nWhile STMicroelectronics reported revenue degrowth in fiscal 2025, SMT stock has trended higher by 28% in the last six months, in part due to a positive long-term outlook backed by key strategic partnerships.\nMultiple Growth Triggers While revenue degrowth is a concern, STM stock has been in an uptrend. After all, the company has multiple growth catalysts in the next few years. The partnership with AWS is one growth trigger. Similarly, the company’s chip supply to SpaceX for Starlink is expected to double in the next two years.\n\nStory Continues\nSTM has also indicated that revenue from silicon carbide power devices is expected to return to 2024 levels by next year. This is after a contraction in revenue in 2025. Further, the firm is targeting data center revenue of $1 billion before the end of the decade.\nIn another important development in December 2025, the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a €500 million financing agreement with the company. This is the initial tranche for a €1 billion credit line that’s intended to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. According to the agreement, 60% of the funds will be utilized toward “high-volume manufacturing capabilities” within Europe while 40% will be dedicated to research & development activities. These investments are likely to translate into growth and provide STM with an innovation edge, especially with the emphasis on R&D.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Say About STM Stock? Given the ratings of 17 analysts, STM stock is a consensus “Moderate Buy.” While eight analysts assign a “Strong Buy” rating to STM, another eight have a “Hold\" rating while one analyst has a bearish “Strong Sell” rating.\nBased on these opinions, STM stock has a mean price target of $33.25 currently, implying potential downside of 1% from current levels. However, the most bullish price target of $45 suggests that STM could rise as much as 34% from here.\nOne important point to note is that STM stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 times. With analysts estimating earnings growth of 100% and 68% for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively, shares will likely remain in an uptrend.\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect us can be found in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can locate these reports through our website at https://investors.arista.com/ and on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/ . All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and accompanying table contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions, including the recognition of direct excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, as well as non-recurring adjustments to our tax provision resulting from the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBB Act\"). Effective the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, the Company updated its methodology for calculating the income tax effect of Non-GAAP adjustments. Previously, the Company’s calculation excluded all tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, consisting of both direct excess tax benefits and other discrete indirect effects. Under the updated methodology, the Company continues to exclude direct excess tax benefits but no longer excludes the discrete indirect effects of such awards. Management believes this change better aligns with industry practice and provides a more meaningful view of the Company’s effective tax rate. All prior period Non-GAAP results presented in this release have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nThe company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Data Center Switching, Andrew Lerner et al., 31 March 2025\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure, Mike Leibovitz et al., 25 June 2025\nGARTNER and MAGIC QUADRANT are trademarks of Gartner, Inc. and its affiliates.\nGartner does not endorse any company, vendor, product or service depicted in its publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.\nGartner publications consist of the opinions of Gartner’s business and technology insights organization and should not be construed as statements of fact.

      "Content": "1 Brilliant AI Stock That You Should Buy Hand Over Fist in 2026\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 12:49 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBroadcom 's (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock rallied nearly 600% over the past five years. Most of that growth was driven by its aggressive acquisitions and its brisk sales of AI chips. Let's see why it could still be one of the best stocks to buy in 2026 as the AI market continues to expand.\nWhy is Broadcom growing so rapidly? From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended last November), Broadcom's revenue grew at a 22% CAGR from $23.9 billion to $63.9 billion. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) rose at a 26% CAGR from $13.6 billion to $43.0 billion.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nTwo catalysts fueled that expansion. First, it expanded its infrastructure software business through major acquisitions -- including its 2023 takeover of the cloud giant VMware -- to reduce its dependence on the cyclical semiconductor market. Second, it sold more networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips to data centers to support the latest AI applications.\n\nUnlike Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which sells general-purpose data center GPUs for processing AI tasks, Broadcom sells customized AI accelerators for hyperscalers. In fiscal 2025, Broadcom's AI chip revenue surged 65% to $20 billion. That accounted for 31% of its top line and offset the slower growth of its non-AI chip and infrastructure software businesses.\nWhy will Broadcom continue to grow? Broadcom aims to generate annualized AI chip revenues of $60 billion to $90 billion by the end of fiscal 2027, with most of that growth coming from just three of its hyperscale customers. That rosy outlook suggests the world's largest cloud companies are eagerly developing their own custom AI accelerators with Broadcom to curb their long-term dependence on Nvidia.\nBroadcom will also likely continue to acquire more companies to fortify its AI chipmaking and infrastructure software businesses. Its non-AI chip businesses -- which sell a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio-frequency chips for other markets -- should also benefit from the long-term expansion of the mobile, automotive, and industrial sectors.\nFrom fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at CAGRs of 38% and 36%, as those tailwinds kick in. With an enterprise value of $1.65 trillion, it still looks reasonably valued at 26 times this year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\nStory Continues\nSo if you're looking for a balanced AI stock with plenty of upside potential, Broadcom checks all the right boxes. It might not attract as much attention as Nvidia, but it's also one of the best producers of picks and shovels for the ongoing AI gold rush.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Outperform Nvidia in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 12:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nTSM\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has played a pioneering role in artificial intelligence (AI) technology for more than three years now, which is not surprising as its chips have helped train popular large language models (LLMs) and move those models into production.\nHowever, Nvidia has been losing steam of late. The semiconductor stock is up just 3% in the past six months, driven by multiple concerns such as its valuation, the sustainability of high AI data center spending, and circular financing deals. But there's another semiconductor bellwether that has outperformed Nvidia during this period -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nLet's see why TSMC stock has jumped over 43% in the past six months and is capable of outperforming Nvidia in 2026 as well.\nTSMC is the driving force behind the AI chip revolution There is no denying that Nvidia's chip systems have been the building blocks of the global AI revolution. However, it is worth noting that TSMC has played a central role in helping Nvidia dominate the AI chip market.\nThat's because Nvidia is a fabless chipmaker, which means that it only designs and sells chips. It needs to go to a foundry -- TSMC, in this case, to get those chips manufactured. TSMC's advanced chip nodes have allowed Nvidia to turn its chip designs into reality. More importantly, TSMC doesn't manufacture AI chips for just Nvidia.\n\nIts foundries are utilized by Broadcom , AMD , Qualcomm , Apple , and other companies to make chips that power various AI applications, such as data centers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs). So, while Nvidia is reliant on TSMC to make cutting-edge chips, TSMC is the go-to manufacturer for multiple chip designers.\nThis ensures that TSMC is right in the middle of the AI chip boom. Not surprisingly, TSMC is anticipating an increase of almost 30% in revenue in 2026 in U.S. dollar terms. However, the company could easily do better than that thanks to potentially higher prices for its most advanced chip nodes, as well as an increase in its production capacity this year .\nStronger-than-anticipated growth should help TSMC outperform Nvidia Nvidia's valuation may continue to weigh on the stock in 2026. After all, it is trading at 24 times sales, a premium to TSMC's sales multiple of 15. Of course, Nvidia's valuation can be justified by the stronger growth that it can deliver in comparison to TSMC this year, with analysts expecting a 52% jump in revenue and a 63% increase in earnings in fiscal 2027 (which has just begun), but TSMC looks like the better value play that investors are more likely to be interested in.\n\nStory Continues\nAssuming TSMC's revenue indeed increases by 30% in 2026 to $159 billion (from $122.4 billion last year), and it continues to trade at 15 times sales after a year, its market cap could hit $2.4 trillion. That suggests potential upside of 33% from current levels, though don't be surprised to see TSMC stock doing better than that and continuing to outperform Nvidia stock owing to potential price rises and the new capacity that it is bringing online.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BTDR.\nIs BTDR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nQ : What are the main items being discussed in your co-location negotiations? Is it down to price, duration, timing, or design? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: Discussions vary with different counterparties, covering all those aspects. These discussions are sensitive and active, and while we are confident about closing deals soon, predicting the exact timeframe is challenging.\n\nQ : Regarding financing, what should we expect in terms of debt, cost of capital, and credit enhancements? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The cost of capital will depend on the counterparties and deal terms, making it hard to predict until deals are finalized. Credit enhancements are crucial for determining development costs, and we are exploring various approaches, though nothing dramatically different from existing market practices.\n\nStory Continues\nQ : Can you provide more details on the infrastructure piece, specifically the Tel Norway site and its customer profile? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: The Tel Norway site retrofit is expected to complete by year-end, with production GPUs installed early next year. The site benefits from a low PUE of around 1.1 due to its hydropower and cold climate. Customer discussions are sensitive, but there is overlap with US customers.\n\nQ : How should we think about the growth of your Bitcoin mining business in 2026, especially with AI infrastructure deals in play? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: We are long-term believers in Bitcoin and will continue investing in mining capacity. While we haven't projected future hash rates, we remain committed to expanding our self-mining operations.\nQ : With lower Bitcoin prices, is there a point where you would slow mining activity due to higher costs? A : Harris Bassett, Chief Strategy Officer: There is a price point where we might slow down, but we haven't reached it yet. Our fleet's efficiency and low energy costs allow us to continue operations even if prices drop further. Older machines might be turned off first, but we don't anticipate reaching that point soon.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Analog Devices Narrative The company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward You will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "What Makes Monolithic Power (MPWR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 9:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MPWR\n\nMomentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nEarnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPWR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Monolithic Power on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Jihan, Matt, and Haris will be available for questions after the formal remarks. To accompany today's call, we have provided a supplemental investor presentation available on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s investor relations website under Webcasts and Presentations. Before management begins their formal remarks, I would like to remind everyone that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.\n\nFor a more complete discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties related to Bitdeer Technologies Group's business, please refer to the company's filings with the SEC. In addition to discussing results calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, we will also reference certain non-IFRS financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit and loss. For more detailed information on our non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to our earnings release published earlier today, which can be found on Bitdeer Technologies Group’s IR website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Haris. Thank you, John, and good day, everyone.\nHaris Basit: It is great to be with you today. The 2025 marked a defining period of execution and strategic progress for Bitdeer Technologies Group. Achieved critical milestones across our three strategic pillars, and position the company for sustained growth as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company. I will start with a brief overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Fourth quarter total revenue reached $225,000,000, up 226% year over year and 33% sequentially. Gross profit totaled $10,600,000, adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000 for the quarter.\n\nWhile both metrics declined sequentially, the results primarily reflect a combination of lower average Bitcoin pricing, modestly higher electricity costs, substantially higher depreciation expense due to the rapid expansion of our self-mining capacity, and further investment in new talent to support our growing AI HPC initiatives. I will discuss these factors in greater detail later in the call. Let me begin with a brief review of our power and infrastructure portfolio. We continue to make meaningful progress during the quarter, advancing a global portfolio of sites that we believe are well suited to support both large-scale Bitcoin mining and next-generation AI and HPC workloads.\n\nStory Continues\nAcross regions, our focus remains on developing power-rich, capital-efficient infrastructure that provides flexibility, speed to market, and long-term strategic optionality. From an energy infrastructure perspective, execution during the quarter remained on track. At the January, we had over 1.66 gigawatts of capacity online, and a total global power pipeline of three gigawatts. We believe this represents one of the most attractive and AI-suitable power portfolios in the industry and provides us with a vast opportunity as the demand for such capacity continues to grow. Over the past several months, have seen a significant shift in market dynamics around AI data center development.\n\nDemand for large-scale colocation capacity has increased substantially and we have responded by refining our approach to better align with this opportunity. Therefore, we are currently prioritizing colocation services provided to Norway and the United States that are suitable for large-scale AI HPC deployments. Let me walk through a few sites and where we stand with our development plans. First, Teadle, Norway, represents our most near-term colocation opportunity. This 225-megawatt facility was originally constructed to Tier III data center specifications, which puts us in a favorable position for conversion to AI workloads.\nWe estimate the retrofit will require much less incremental capital expenditure to add uninterruptible power supply systems, backup batteries, and generation, as well as some additional cooling capacity compared to industry benchmarks for greenfield Tier III data center development, which typically run in the $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 per megawatt range. The site benefits from hydropower with attractive economics; independent 100-megawatt transformers provide redundancy. We are currently in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expect to be in a position to announce a signed lease agreement for Teadle as soon as possible in 2026, although the exact timing is very difficult to predict.\n\nThis site should be capable of supporting initial test GPU deployment late 2026 and first production GPUs expected in early 2027. Second, our 570-megawatt site in Clarington represents one of the larger AI data center development opportunities in the United States. Have made progress on two fronts here. First, the local utility has accelerated our interconnection timeline. Second, we are currently in discussion with multiple prospective tenants. These are well recognizable companies in the space, and the discussions are progressing. While litigation has recently been filed that could potentially delay development at this location, believe that we have meritorious claims and a strong defense and will pursue an expedient solution.\nGiven the scale of this site, even a partial or first phase lease would represent a significant milestone for Bitdeer Technologies Group and would provide substantial contracted revenue while derisking our development capital. Third, at Rockdale, we are pursuing a strategy that allows us to maintain our current Bitcoin mining operations while developing new HPC capacity. We are evaluating the acquisition of adjacent land to our existing facility we could potentially construct a purpose-built HPC data center. This approach would minimize disruption during data center development to our 563-megawatt mining operation, which continues to generate revenue. The greenfield HPC build would be designed from the ground up for AI workloads.\n\nThe Rockdale site benefits from its location in the ERCOT market, provides operational flexibility. We are currently talking with prospective colocation tenants for this site. The dual-track approach, maintaining Bitcoin mining while developing HPC capacity, reflects our commitment to both businesses and our ability to optimize our power portfolio across use cases. While we are prioritizing colocation for our larger sites, continue to see opportunity in GPU-as-a-service for targeted markets. We are expanding our cloud platform in Malaysia by 10 to 15 megawatts, building on the success we have had in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming sectors who need fully managed orchestrated infrastructure.\nIn the United States, we are planning to add 10 megawatts of GPU capacity in Washington state and are evaluating a partial conversion of our Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud. I want to be clear that the scale of our long-term US GPU-as-a-service expansion is predicated on signing customer contracts. Do not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. Expect all major GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customers who are seeking meaningful capacity with comprehensive managed services. This disciplined approach ensures we are deploying capital we have revenue certainty. A key element of our strategy is how we are approaching data center development.\n\nWe have built an internal development team with experience in very large data center construction and we are augmenting that team through strategic hires, working with experienced EPC contractors and general contractors on a fee basis rather than through joint venture arrangements. This gives us greater control over timelines and specifications, and importantly, it allows us to retain more of the economic value these assets generate. As we look ahead, the growth will continue to be anchored by our three strategic pillars, between mining, ASIC development, and HPC AI. Together, these represent a vertically integrated, highly defensible platform that leverages our deep technology expertise, proprietary chip design capabilities, and extensive global power portfolio.\n\nThe supply-demand imbalance for AI compute continues to widen, and we expect this shortage to persist well into 2027. Time to power is a critical variable, and we believe Bitdeer Technologies Group is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers seeking both near-term and midterm capacity. On the Bitcoin mining side, the rapid expansion of our self-mining platform continues. We exited the year with more than 55 exahash per second of self-mining hash rate, and in the month of January alone, we brought another eight exahash per second online, exiting the month of January at over 63 exahash per second. This firmly establishes Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miners by total hash rate under management.\n\nSupported by the disciplined rollout of our SealMiner fleet, accelerated deployment of SealMiner rigs has driven material improvements in fleet-wide efficiency. The SealMiner A2 and A3 being actively deployed in our self-mining business operate at approximately 15 to 16.5 joules per terahash and 12.5 to 14 joules per terahash respectively, and represent industry-leading power efficiency. As these next-generation rigs replace legacy third-party equipment, our blended fleet efficiency continues to improve, with our overall fleet-wide efficiency currently standing at 17.5 joules per terahash as of 01/31/2026. As SealMiner penetration increases throughout 2026, we expect our overall fleet-wide efficiency to continue to improve, enhancing our mining margins. Looking ahead, our self-mining operations are not plateauing.\n\nOur investments in chip design are delivering tangible results. During the quarter, we commenced mass production of the SealMiner A3 series. Initial shipments began in November, and we have deployed a total of 8.7 exahash of our SealMiner A3 to date. As we continue to retire older-generation third-party rigs, we expect the A3 series to continue to meaningfully contribute to our fleet efficiency improvements and growth throughout 2026. On the R&D front, our CLO4-1 chip was completed back in September. The CLO4-1 represents a meaningful step forward in efficiency and positions Bitdeer Technologies Group to maintain technological leadership as the industry continues its relentless drive towards lower power consumption per unit of hash rate.\n\nMass production of mining rigs based on the CLO4-1 chip will begin in Q1 2026. CLO4-2 chip design remains under development at our US-based design center. Additionally, we have successfully taped out a new Litecoin chip, SEAL-DL1, designed for Doge and Litecoin mining. The initial test results of SEAL-DL1 have exceeded comparable rigs in both energy efficiency and hash rate. On the recent market conditions, the CLDL1 generates higher fiat-based returns per megawatt than our SealMiner A2. Preparation for USA SealMiner manufacturing remains in progress. This initiative is a core component of our vertically integrated strategy and aligns with both operational resilience objectives and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.\nNow let me walk through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all figures I refer to today are in US dollars. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $224,800,000, up 225.8% year over year and up 32.5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth and sequential growth in revenue was primarily driven by significantly higher self-mining hash rate as a result of continued CLMiner deployment, as well as contributions from SealMiner sales, offset in part by slightly lower Bitcoin prices for the quarter. Self-mining revenue was $168,600,000, compared to $41,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $130,900,000 in Q3 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 306% and a sequential growth of 28.7%.\n\nContinued growth from Q3 2025 levels reflects a significant increase in average operating hash rate and associated Bitcoin production during the quarter, offset in part by 13% lower average Bitcoin prices quarter on quarter. SealMiner sales revenue was $23,400,000, up 105.4% over the $11,400,000 reported in Q3 2025. Total gross profit for the quarter was $10,600,000, reflecting a gross margin of 4.7%, versus 7.4% in Q4 2024 and $40,800,000 or 24.1% in Q3 2025. Significant decline in gross margin reflects the combined impact of several drivers during the quarter. First, obviously, we experienced 13% lower Bitcoin prices during the quarter along with the gradual increase of the global hash rate.\nSecond, on the cost side, experienced an approximately 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit during the quarter when compared to Q3 2025, mainly due to the seasonal winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites. Third, the growth in our self-mining hash rate comes with a concurrent noncash depreciation expense associated with this fleet of new miners. Additionally, during the quarter, we changed our methodology for calculating depreciation expense to reflect a more conservative approach. Now depreciate rigs using a three-year straight-line method versus our prior assumption of a five-year depreciable life for hardware. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $66,300,000 compared to $42,500,000 in Q4 2024 and $60,500,000 in Q3 2025.\n\nThe sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following factors compared to Q3. We added more headcount to support both mining site operations and our AI infrastructure expansion, incurred additional holiday season compensation, along with an increase in year-end general corporate activities. These expenditures reflect the operational requirements of our growing infrastructure footprint and the resources necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives. Other operating expenses for the quarter was $43,800,000 compared to $3,700,000 in Q4 2024 and other operating income of $26,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to the fair value change of Bitcoins pledged for the Bitcoin-collateralized loan since Q3 2025.\n\nOther net gain for the quarter was $208,900,000 compared to other net loss of $4 and $79,800,000 in Q4 2024 and $238,500,000 in Q3 2025. This was largely attributable to noncash fair value change of derivative liabilities related to the convertible senior notes issued in November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025. Adjusted net loss was $82,600,000 versus $37,400,000 in Q4 2024 and $36,300,000 in Q3 2025. The increase in loss was primarily due to higher energy and depreciation costs, higher operating and interest expense, partially offset by the year-over-year higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $31,200,000, versus negative $4,300,000 in Q4 2024 and positive $39,600,000 in Q3 2025.\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher operating expenses attributed to salaries and wages for recent additions to our headcount, as well as a number of elevated costs associated with year-end holiday allowance and year-end general corporate activities. To provide a better sense of our G&A expense on a run-rate basis, our Q4 2025 results reflect approximately $3,000,000 of salary, wage, and benefits expense which will largely be recurring, as well as another $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 in consulting, legal, and travel expenses which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $599,500,000, primarily driven by SealMiner supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs from the mining business, general corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97,900,000, which includes $50,700,000 of capital expenditures relating to data center infrastructure construction, GPU equipment procurement, and tariffs and freight for mining rigs delivered to the data centers, and $150,600,000 of proceeds from the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the quarter $454,500,000, which resulted primarily from $388,500,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $168,000,000 in borrowings from a related party, and $141,500,000 of proceeds from shares sold under our ATM and ELOC program, free offset by $171,100,000 of repayments of borrowings. For the full calendar year 2025, capital expenditures for the continued build out of our global power and data center infrastructure totaled $176,000,000. Looking to full year 2026, we anticipate total infrastructure spend in the range of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 for crypto mining data center construction.\n\nPlease note that this guidance covers power and crypto mining data center infrastructure only and does not include CapEx for SealMiners and GPU. AI cloud and colocation capital expenditures are also not included. Turning to our balance sheet and financial position. We exited the year with $149,400,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $83,100,000 in cryptocurrencies, held at cost less impairment, $135,600,000 in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1,000,000,000 in borrowings excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities were $501,100,000, relate to the November 2024, June 2025, and November 2025 convertible senior notes.\nThis represents $171,400,000 reduction compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a noncash fair value adjustment driven by the change in our stock price and settlement for partial principal of November 2024 convertible senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, this does not impact our liquidity or operations. Regarding our outstanding ATM and ELOC facility, we received approximately $143,600,000 in gross proceeds during the quarter. Approximately 6,700,000 additional shares issued. We have exercised disciplined capital allocation throughout the year using the ATM and ELOC opportunistically to support our growth initiative while minimizing dilution.\n\nAs a final note to our financial update, we wish to note that starting in Q1 2026, we will begin to use GAAP instead of IFRS as our accounting standard. In summary, we are proud of our team's execution this quarter and throughout 2025. I want to express my deep pride what our team has accomplished this year. Established Bitdeer Technologies Group as one of the world's largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining operators by total hash rate under management. Our leadership position in self-mining and our proprietary SealMiner technology provide multiple paths to value creation that few, if any, competitors can match.\nOur pipeline of developed and contracted power capacity gives us a meaningful competitive edge in serving a variety of customers. The colocation opportunity ahead of us is immense, we are pursuing it proactively. We enter 2026 with strong operational momentum, a differentiated asset base, and a team that has proven its ability to execute at scale. Excited about what lies ahead and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, Operator. Please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open for questions. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *11 and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Giles of B. Securities. Your line is now open.\nNick Giles: Yes. Thank you so much, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Haris, really appreciate the comprehensive update, especially on the colocation side. And my first question was just, and I am sure you are speaking to a range of customers, and you know, at this point of negotiations or discussions, what is really the main items that are being discussed? Is it down to price, duration, timing? There is still a lot of work ongoing around design. Just any additional color on where you stand in the process.\n\nHaris Basit: It is different with different potential counterparties, and we are all of those things that you mentioned are being discussed, maybe not with the same counterparty, but you know, I hesitate to say too much about these discussions. They are sensitive, and you know, very active at this time. So you know, we feel pretty confident that we are going to get colocation deals done in the near future. Predicting that time frame is going to be hard. And, you know, the discussions are pretty intense with several counterparties.\nNick Giles: No. Understood. That is helpful, and just my second question was, we think about financing, you made some important comments there on having a larger share of the economics. But should we be expecting in terms of debt cost of capital and what kind of credit enhancements are you looking at, if any?\n\nHaris Basit: Cost of capital for these projects, for the colocation projects, will be very much determined by the counterparties and exact terms of the deal. So I think that is hard to predict right now until we, you know, announce which of these deals are done with which counterparties. Was that responsive to your question? I am not sure if that is what you were.\nNick Giles: Asking.\nHaris Basit: I mean, that is an important part of any deal. And, you know, it is because it does determine the cost of development to a large extent. And so we are, you know, we are looking at many different approaches here. It is a very important part of getting the deal done right. So it is something that we are focusing on as well. I cannot really say which ones are better or worse. It depends a lot on the counterparty, and it depends on, you know, there is a number of ways to do this. Most of them have been already done in the Marketplace.\n\nAnd know, I do not think you will see anything too dramatically different from those when we announce.\nNick Giles: Got it. Understood. Well, again, I appreciate the update, and continue. Best of luck.\nJihan Wu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Colonnese of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Your line is now open.\nMike Colonnese: Today. First one for me on the infrastructure piece. It sounds like you are pretty far along in negotiations for a potential colo deal at the Teadle site. Curious what type of customers you are in discussions with specifically at that campus. And, Haris, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the full retrofit for the 225 megs could be completed by the end of this year. There a PUE you guys are assuming that number? I know it is built with Tier III standards in mind, but any additional color would be helpful there.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is correct. We do expect completion of that Teadle Norway site in at the end of this year and then installation of production GPUs at the beginning of next year. And the PUE at that site is actually very low, which is one of the biggest advantages of that site. It is, you know, it is 100% hydropower. It is a nice cold climate. And there is chilled water available from a nearby lake. So the PUE there, for estimation purposes, is around 1.1. It is dramatically better than most locations.\nMike Colonnese: Got it. And then, the typical customer profile for that site specific, I know you are in discussions with the range of customers across the portfolio. I would be just curious with that international facility, the type of customers you are looking at.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, there is some difference, but, you know, there is still a lot of overlap with the customers there versus customers in the United States. So but, you know, I really do not want to say too much about who we are talking to and the exact nature of those deals. They are fairly sensitive negotiations at this point. Understood. Understood. And then as it relates to the Bitcoin mining business, you guys are one of the few public miners that continue to rapidly expand your self-mining capacity. How should we think about growth in this business in 2026? Particularly as you look to pursue these AI infrastructure deals across parts of the portfolio?\nHaris Basit: So one thing to say is that we are long-term believers in Bitcoin. And, of course, Bitcoin is in a little bit of a down cycle right now. But long term, we believe in Bitcoin. And we will continue to invest in our Bitcoin mining capacity. We have not given any projections for what the total hash rate for our company might be by the end of this year or in any future quarter yet. We are still evaluating that and we may project that at a later time. But at this time, we do not have any projections to share publicly for future growth of our hash rate.\n\nMike Colonnese: Got it. Thanks for the color, Haris, and best of luck with these opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\nKevin Cassidy: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all this capacity you have activated. But maybe along those lines that was asked before, with the lower Bitcoin prices, is there a price where you slow your mining activity because costs are higher versus what the hash price would be?\nHaris Basit: I am sure there is such a price, so we just have not reached it yet. So you know, our efficiency of our fleet keeps improving. And, so it also, you know, as price goes down, it be the entire fleet. Some parts of the fleet, you know, because of the efficiency and because of the energy price at that location, can continue to operate for quite some, you know, in quite some even further decrease beyond here. And then you will, some of the older machines that have been around for several years, those could be turned off first. Right? In fact, just in our normal upgrade cycle, we will be replacing those.\n\nSo there is, you know, we have not reached that point now, and I do not anticipate that we will. But, you know, of course, there is such a price. It is just much lower than what we are at now.\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. That is good information. I guess as you keep lowering your costs, then you can handle lower Bitcoin prices. But just as another topic, is the GPU-as-a-service, is there a good market for the, say, N minus one GPU clusters rather than spending money on the very leading edge of GPUs? Is there still a need for GPU-as-a-service for the older GPUs?\nHaris Basit: Yes. There is. We are, though, however, typically pursuing the latest and greatest GPUs. But I mean, we still get demand for, you know, even our oldest H100s that we have in Singapore.\n\nKevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi of ROTH. Your line is now open.\nDarren Aftahi: Yes, good morning. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Haris, could you dive a little bit more into sort of the scale and scope of the hires you have made for digital infrastructure towards the end of the year that you spoke to, and then kind of the cadence of continued investment in maybe Q1 and into 2026? I guess, at what point do you feel like you have an adequate team to kind of attack this opportunity?\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I mean, we are very pleased with some of our recent hires. We have hired people with direct expertise in AI, in cloud services. And a lot of those folks have been in the United States, but also in Asia. The team is, you know, the number of people dedicated to this has grown dramatically. I do not think I have an exact number. But we continue to hire. I do not think we have reached, you know, a place where we think we have enough folks yet. But we are still looking for people, especially on the side of the engineering part of building data centers with still open racks there. So no.\n\nI expect that we will continue to hire throughout the year. And a lot of those folks will be in the United States. But, you know, we have also done significant AI hiring in Asia.\nDarren Aftahi: Got it. And then same question on the Rockdale site is sort of twofold. In terms of land acquisition for that, kind of where are you, and what is the timeline on process? And then I know Oncor is supposed to put another substation in, and I think you guys have spoken to additional capacity there. I think it is in the 100-some plus megawatts. But in light of kind of the seesaw that is going on with ERCOT and decision on batching, just kind of curious about your thoughts about prospects of Rockdale actually growing as a site. Thanks.\nHaris Basit: The recent, you know, information around ERCOT and power allocation in that region, we do not believe that applies to the growth at Rockdale. So the 179, up to 179 megawatts that we anticipate we could add there, should not be affected by that. And I say it that way because, of course, we do not know what the exact regulations will be. They are just still under discussion. So we do expect that we will get most of that, if not all of that additional capacity. The land acquisition there is moving forward. You know, it is not done until it is done, but we are, we are, yeah.\n\nI am not sure how to characterize where we are in that process, but, you know, we are actively pursuing it. And we expect that we will finish it. But until we do, it is hard to say exactly when that is going to happen. Great. Appreciate the insights. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis of BTIG. Your line is now open.\nGreg Lewis: Hey. Thank you, and good morning. Good open. Hey, I guess first, I mean, on published numbers, I guess you guys are the bitcoin miner of the listed companies by XFASH. So congrats on that. I did want to talk a little bit about the GPU business. You noted about potential expanse. You should a mouthful. The potential expansion in Malaysia. Know, just kind of curious, is that infrastructure that we are building, are we leasing? And then just kind of how should we think about, you know, the rollout of that, I guess, I think you mentioned 15 megawatts in Malaysia for the GPUs.\n\nHaris Basit: Yeah. That is infrastructure that we are leasing. I welcome Matt or Jihan to add to that. They want. But what was the second part of your question? How should we think about the rollout of bringing those 15 megawatts online and generating revenue from that? I mean, we have proactively purchased some, I think, the GB200 NVL72 and installed it just recently there. So that is in place right now. In terms of additional machines there, do not think we have made any announcements at present. So that is actually.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. But it is, but it sounds like it sounds like we could start seeing revenue maybe in the second quarter, and then maybe that scales up sequentially for a couple of quarters?\nHaris Basit: Yeah. I think, John and Matt are closer to that than I am. So I do not know if, is that a, is that a correct statement that you have?\n\nJihan Wu: I think we will be able to deploy GPUs into those infrastructures at the fourth quarter or third quarter of this year. It depends on when that infrastructure will be ready. We will no tests. It will be ready around June. But, and maybe there will be one or two month delays. So I sent 2024 can be more conservative estimation.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Alright. Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time, and have a great day.\nJihan Wu: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham. Your line is now open.\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question and the all the extra hash, bro. I guess, can we just get a bit more color on Clarrington? Like, do you need litigation results before signing an HPC customer there? You view that differently. Maybe any guardrails on timeline there? And then I have a follow-up on the mining piece.\n\nHaris Basit: So because it is litigation, we have to be sort of, you know, more careful in what we say here. You know, our attorneys feel very strongly that we have a very good case here, and the litigation has little merit, and we will, you know, prevail here. And on the business side, we are, you know, exploring alternative that can mitigate the impact of the litigation. I do not really want to say a lot more than that. You know, as we said in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate that there will be, you know, some potential delay. But, you know, we are still confident in the site overall.\nBut it is early days, and we, you know, we are looking at some significant alternatives.\nJihan Wu: Yeah. I think the alternative, alternative here, we have multiple alternative options. Creating alternative options is to solve those problems. I believe it is very critical solving those problems. And at a company level, Clarrington, Rockdale, and our lower chin size, we would be able to have lots of alternatives. Other than Carrington. This is the company level. And under the Clariton level, we believe we have several solutions. So I do not think that we are really caught at this kind of litigation.\n\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on the that latest tape out for the Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, do you anticipate mining some of these other assets? Alongside Bitcoin? And maybe I was looking at some of the margin profile. It looks like there is still some margin there. But maybe the opportunity in those as well.\nJihan Wu: Well, I think 99% or 98% will still be Bitcoin mining. This autochrome mining operations cannot really be scalable very much due to the market cap. So we count into a very small size operations. But on those, on those capacity, we deploy those manual rates yield out of from those capacity will be significantly improved. So I think it is worth the effort to add some, add some. And then, by the way, this is our first b commanding chip and the manual machines that are designed and manufactured totally depends on our Singapore and the Malaysia office. And the Malaysia operation as well. Malaysia operation, we started to build since last year or earlier.\n\nI think that this product, it also means that our supply chain center in Malaysia has been quite mature. So Malaysia and Vietnam, we will have two supply chain center. For companies. Think it is very strategic and important for the resilience of our business in the future.\nHaris Basit: Understood. That is helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Knoblauch of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nBrett Knoblauch: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe now that we are several weeks into the year, I am curious if you have any insights into what wafer allocation is going to look like this year compared to last year? And on the back of that, with Bitcoin price coming down, network cash staying resilient, hash price going to kind of near all-time lows, does that, you know, more incentivize you guys to use manufacturing capacity for, call it, internal use rather than sell external? Or how should we kind of look at the split between what you guys manufacture for yourselves Versus sell this year? Thank you.\n\nJihan Wu: We cannot tell the exact number or situation with the different allocation, but we have a really good relationships. And even though the we all know that the demand for AI business is huge, several times. Then take them to rehab, but we will get some co coda from additional capacity. And the hash price drops to historically due now recently. And it became very difficult for sending the money works with profit. But we have our own capacities or electricity cost is one of the lowest on the market. And our CapEx, so perhaps combined together, we are the lowest on the market.\nSo our self money definitely became kind of very defensive, very safe strategy for our companies to make sure that even though in this kind of environment, our Bitcoin mining operations will be profitable. So self deployment will be a very important strategy in 2006, especially in the kind of a very bearish marketplace. I think our market share for the Bitcoin mining output will continue to grow. Into something.\n\nHaris Basit: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland. Your line is now open.\nMike Grondahl: Hey, thank you. Hey, Haris, I just wanted to ask, on the November call, there was a significant emphasis on, you know, GPU rental, and that is what Bitdeer Technologies Group wanted to do. And now it seems like you are adjusting that a little bit on some of the larger sites, you know, colocation. Can you just talk about pivot away or why you are seemingly deemphasizing GPU rental at some of those large sites?\nHaris Basit: Maybe, Jihan, do you want to do that answer first, and then I can chime in if there is still.\nJihan Wu: Yes. I as an on the very live site, colocation is kind of very natural and good choice for a company. And for GPU rental, we have a smaller size Washington State and Tennessee State. We can absolutely handle that ourselves. And maybe a larger capacitors for a lot of interest is besides, like, 10 megawatts or 50 megawatts. They want the nitrocytes anyway, and the nitrocytes in before company better to have some coefficient deal.\n\nHaris Basit: Do you have another question, Mike?\nMike Grondahl: No. So hey. Just so I understand, you have just sort of the larger sites, you will go colocation. The smaller ones, you go GPU rental. I guess that was kinda my takeaway. Is that fair?\nHaris Basit: Yes. That is correct. Got it.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line Steven Glagola of KBW. Your line is now open.\nSteven Glagola: Hey, thanks for the question. I have two. First for Haris. I would like to clarify whether Bitdeer Technologies Group’s US AI cloud expansion and potential expansion in Washington and Tennessee is dependent on securing multiyear reserve capacity agreements? And if so, one of those commitments would primarily be for bare metal deployments. That is one. And then second, for Jihan and Matt, you know, it would be helpful to hear your perspective on why USA cloud expansion is strategically attractive at this stage. You know, how do you think about sort of long-term competitive advantages in AI cloud as you broaden beyond your current Asia-centric footprint? Thank you.\n\nHaris Basit: So the first part, our expansion of GPU in the United States is dependent on, you know, signing contracts, at least any significant large-scale expansion is. You know, we can speculatively do small expansion in the United States. But as we said in the statement, anything significant would be backed by contracts.\nJihan Wu: And we have our own data centers. I think that is very important advantage right now in the US market.

The demand in US market is so much stronger than any other market. And also the US customers also just one. Capacity on US soil. So we have this kind of capacity in US.

      "Content": "Reinhart Partners Bets on Sports Growth With Madison Square Garden Sports Purchase\n\nJake Lerch, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 8:27 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: FCNCA\n\nSIMO\n\nYETI\n\nIDCC\n\nOn February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) , acquiring 214,891 shares in an estimated $55.59 million trade based on quarterly average pricing.\nWhat Happened According to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners initiated a new position in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp., purchasing 214,891 shares. The estimated transaction value was $55.59 million, calculated using the average price during the quarter. The fund’s quarter-end stake in MSGS was valued at $55.59 million, with the net position change reflecting both purchase volume and share price fluctuation in the period.\nWhat Else to Know This was a new position for the fund, representing 1.66% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\nTop five holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares of MSGS were priced at $279.76, up 34.3% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 19.92 percentage points.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nMarket Capitalization\n$6.73 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.07 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n($16.56 million)\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n$279.76\n\nCompany Snapshot Operates professional sports franchises, including the New York Knicks (NBA), New York Rangers (NHL), development league teams, and esports organizations\nOwns and manages sports assets, generating revenue from media rights, sponsorships, and merchandising\nServes sports fans, media partners, and corporate sponsors, with a focus on the New York metropolitan area and global sports audiences\nMadison Square Garden Sports Corp. is a leading owner and operator of major professional sports franchises, leveraging iconic brands such as the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. The company capitalizes on its strong market presence and diversified sports assets to drive revenue from multiple streams, including media, sponsorship, and merchandising. Its strategic focus on marquee teams and premier sports entertainment positions it as a key player in the U.S. sports and entertainment industry.\n\nWhat This Transaction Means For Investors Recently, Reinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately 215,000 shares of Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (MSGS) valued at around $55.6 million. Here’s what it means for investors.\nTo begin, MSGS stock has performed well recently. Over the last five years, shares of MSGS have advanced by 63%, with much of that gain coming in the last year alone. MSGS operates legendary sports franchises, including the New York Rangers and New York Knicks.\n\nStory Continues\nAcross sports leagues like the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), franchise values are soaring. In addition, video streaming services and advertisers are desperate to land exclusive rights to must-watch live events, with sports being the most sought-after category.\n\nTherefore, organizations like MSGS (and their associated leagues) now find themselves in a powerful position to negotiate lucrative media rights deals with both local, national, and even international distributors. All that said, MSGS still remains a relatively small company (market cap of around $6 billion). Moreover, it remains stubbornly unprofitable, with a net income of ($16.6 million) over the last 12 months.\nTo close, investors may want to tread with caution. While MSGS stock does have great potential, its lack of consistent profitability could hold it back. Those interested in sports stocks would be wise to consider this list of best sports stocks to buy in 2026 .\nShould you buy stock in Madison Square Garden Sports right now? Before you buy stock in Madison Square Garden Sports, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Madison Square Garden Sports wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investment Manager Doubles Down on Paycom, Acquires $95 Million Worth of Shares\n\nJake Lerch, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 7:51 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PAYC\n\nFCNCA\n\nSIMO\n\nYETI\n\nIDCC\n\nOn February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners disclosed a significant buy of Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) , adding 537,726 shares in a transaction estimated at $95.28 million based on quarterly average pricing.\nWhat Happened According to an SEC filing dated February 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners increased its holding in Paycom by 537,726 shares. The estimated transaction value was $95.28 million, based on the average closing price during the quarter. At quarter-end, the value of the stake rose by $82.74 million compared to the prior period, a figure that includes both the impact of share purchases and market price changes.\nWhat Else to Know The move was a buy, resulting in Paycom accounting for 2.9% of the fund’s reportable assets as of December 31, 2025.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: FCNCA: $167.04 million (5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.85 million (4.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: YETI: $134.08 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $132.97 million (4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.73 million (3.8% of AUM)\nAs of February 10, 2026, shares were priced at $124.94, down 38.5% over the past year and trailing the S&P 500 by 53.0 percentage points.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$2.00 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$453.20 million\nDividend yield\n1.3%\n\nCompany Snapshot Provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and analytics applications.\nOperates a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, generating recurring revenue from subscription fees for its suite of integrated HCM tools.\nServes small to mid-sized businesses in the United States seeking comprehensive workforce management and compliance solutions.\nPaycom provides cloud-based HCM software delivered through a SaaS model, offering end-to-end workforce management solutions for small to mid-sized businesses in the United States.\n\nWhat This Transaction Means For Investors Reinhart Partners, a Wisconsin-based investment management firm, acquired approximately $95 million worth of Paycom shares during the fourth quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2025). Here’s what investors should take away from this transaction.\nFirst off, it’s important to contextualize this purchase. Paycom shares have been in steady decline for several years. Indeed, since 2021, Paycom stock has fallen by roughly 70%. While there are many reasons for this slide, the biggest has to be the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMany analysts are concerned that AI will serve as a replacement to many ‘off-the-shelf’ software products — particularly in the field of payroll and human resources. That would be a major problem for Paycom, whose business model revolves around the sale of such products. What’s more, the concern isn’t simply theoretical. Paycom’s revenue growth has slowed from 30% in 2021 to under 10% in 2025.\n\nStory continues\nThat’s not to say that Paycom stock can’t bounce back. However, given the rapid development of AI, SaaS companies like Paycom remain at risk. While Paycom stock could be the right choice for investors betting on a turnaround, average investors may be wise to consider these tech stocks to watch in 2026 .\n\nShould you buy stock in Paycom Software right now? Before you buy stock in Paycom Software, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paycom Software wasn’t one of them.

Bitdeer’s total revenue for the quarter was triple the $69.0 million it reported in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe #1 podcast for emerging tech stocks, Bitcoin, and weekly news analysis. Subscribe to the Blockspace Podcast here, on Apple, Spotify, or anywhere you listen to podcasts.\nThe surge in top-line growth stemmed primarily from the expansion of self-mining operations, which generated $168.6 million during the quarter. Bitdeer expanded its proprietary hashrate to 58.0 EH/s, up from 8.9 EH/s in the prior year period, and expanded its total hashrate under management to 71 EH/s.\nBitdeer mined 1,673 bitcoin in the quarter, a sharp rise from the 469 bitcoin produced a year earlier. It improved its bitcoin mining fleet efficiency to 17.9 J/TH as the firm replaced older machines with its proprietary SEALMINER rigs.\nBitdeer sales of SEALMINER rigs and accessories contributed $23.4 million to quarterly revenue. Bitdeer recently taped out its new SEAL-DL1 chip for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining as production of its bitcoin mining rigs topped 65 EH/s in January.\n\nBitdeer earned $2.3 million from its HPC and AI Cloud segment for the quarter. The firm recently deployed NVIDIA GB200 systems in a Malaysian data center to service AI workloads. This move aligns with Bitdeer’s stated dual-track strategy to leverage high-performance computing demand.\nThe company’s management outlined a strategic shift toward AI/HPC infrastructure, prioritizing colocation models for its largest power assets. Matt Kong, Chief Business Officer, noted the firm plans to prioritize colocation for sites like Tydal, Norway, and Clarington, Ohio, to capture superior economics.\nThe timeline for the 570 MW Clarington project remains under review following legal complications. Bitdeer faces a lawsuit from a neighboring tenant alleging the data center plans violate shared infrastructure rights. This dispute has introduced uncertainty regarding the deployment schedule for one of the company’s largest sites under development.\nBitdeer’s balance sheet featured $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, with an additional 2,017 bitcoin valued at approximately $218.6 million. Bitdeer’s debt stands at $1.0 billion following recent convertible note issuances.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group Q4 Earnings Call Highlights\n\nMarketBeat\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 7:34 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: BTDR\n\nBTC-USD\n\nLTC-USD\n\nKey Points Revenue surged 225.8% YoY to $224.8 million in Q4 2025, but gross profit fell to $10.6 million (4.7% margin) as a ~13% lower average Bitcoin price, higher electricity costs and a shift to a three‑year depreciation schedule materially pressured profitability.\nBitdeer is rapidly scaling self‑mining and hardware: self‑mining revenue hit $168.6 million, the company exited 2025 with >55 EH/s and topped >63 EH/s in January, began mass production of SEALMINER A3 and plans SEAL04‑1 volume production in Q1 2026 (SEAL‑DL1 Litecoin chip taped out).\nThe firm is pivoting toward AI/HPC colocation and GPU-as-a-Service with 1.66 GW online and a 3 GW pipeline (key sites Tydal, Clarington, Rockdale), while reporting heavy cash use (net operating cash outflow $599.5 million), ~$1.0 billion of borrowings and a switch to GAAP reporting in Q1 2026.\nInterested in Bitdeer Technologies Group? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\n4 Blockchain Stocks That Aren’t Coinbase\nBitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $224.8 million, up 225.8% year over year and 32.5% sequentially, as the company highlighted continued scale-up in self-mining and growing focus on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure opportunities. Management described the quarter as a period of “execution and strategic progress” as Bitdeer positions itself as a vertically integrated Bitcoin and AI infrastructure company.\nQuarterly results reflect higher scale, but lower Bitcoin pricing and higher costs For the fourth quarter, Bitdeer posted gross profit of $10.6 million, representing a gross margin of 4.7%, down from 24.1% in the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.2 million, compared with $39.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $4.3 million in Q4 2024.\n→ Once Upon A Farm: Buy the $1B Growth Story?\nBeyond the Halving: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\nChief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the sequential decline in profitability primarily reflected a 13% lower average Bitcoin price versus Q3 2025, a roughly 5% increase in average electricity costs per unit driven mainly by winter pricing dynamics at Norway sites, and “substantially higher depreciation expense” tied to rapid expansion of self-mining capacity. The company also increased headcount to support mining operations and AI/HPC initiatives and incurred higher year-end compensation and corporate activity costs.\nBitdeer also changed its depreciation methodology to a more conservative approach, moving to a three-year straight-line method for mining rigs compared with a prior five-year useful life assumption, which contributed to higher depreciation expense.\n\nStory Continues\nSelf-mining growth drives revenue; margins pressured by network and pricing dynamics → No Rally? Coca-Cola’s Results Still Look Like a Sweet Deal\nSelf-mining revenue was $168.6 million, up from $41.5 million in Q4 2024 and $130.9 million in Q3 2025. Management attributed the quarter-over-quarter increase to a higher average operating hash rate and Bitcoin production, partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and a gradual rise in global network hash rate.\nBitdeer also reported $23.4 million in SEALMINER sales revenue, up 105.4% from $11.4 million in Q3 2025.\n→ AI Power Crunch: Why Bloom Energy Is the Hidden Winner\n\nOn fleet expansion, Basit said Bitdeer exited 2025 with more than 55 exahash per second (EH/s) of self-mining hash rate and added another 8 EH/s in January, exiting the month at more than 63 EH/s. As of January 31, 2026, overall fleet efficiency stood at 17.5 joules per terahash, with SEALMINER A2 and A3 rigs operating at approximately 15–16.5 J/TH and 12.5–14 J/TH, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Bitdeer commenced mass production of the SEALMINER A3 series, with initial shipments beginning in November and 8.7 EH/s deployed to date. Basit said mass production of rigs based on the SEAL04-1 chip is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026, while SEAL04-2 remains under development at the company’s U.S.-based design center. Bitdeer also announced it taped out a Litecoin chip (SEAL-DL1) designed for Dogecoin and Litecoin mining, with initial test results said to exceed comparable rigs in energy efficiency and hash rate. CEO Jihan Wu noted the company expects “99% or 98%” of operations to remain Bitcoin-focused, while adding that small-scale altcoin mining could improve yields on certain capacity.\n\nIn Q&A, management said there is a Bitcoin price level that could prompt the company to slow mining activity, but it “hasn’t reached it yet,” adding that higher-efficiency portions of the fleet could operate through further price declines while older machines would be turned off first.\nPower portfolio and AI strategy: colocation prioritized for larger sites Bitdeer emphasized progress on its global power and infrastructure footprint. Basit said the company had more than 1.66 gigawatts (GW) of capacity online at the end of January and a total global power pipeline of 3 GW. Management said it is prioritizing colocation services at AI-suitable sites in Norway and the U.S., reflecting increased demand for large-scale colocation capacity.\nKey site updates included:\nTydal, Norway: A 225-megawatt facility built to Tier 3 data center specifications. Basit said retrofit capex should be lower than typical greenfield Tier 3 development benchmarks of $8 million to $12 million per MW. The site uses hydropower and includes independent 100 MW transformers for redundancy. Management said it is in lease discussions with multiple counterparties and expects to be able to announce a signed lease “as soon as possible in 2026,” though timing is difficult to predict. In Q&A, Basit said estimated PUE is around 1.1, citing hydropower, cold climate, and chilled water availability from a nearby lake. He added the company expects completion of the Tydal site by the end of the year, with production GPU installation at the beginning of next year.\nClarington (U.S.): A 570-megawatt site where the local utility has accelerated the interconnection timeline, and the company is in discussions with “well recognizable companies” as prospective tenants. Management disclosed litigation has been filed that could delay development, but said it believes it has a strong defense and is exploring alternatives to mitigate impact.\nRockdale (Texas): Bitdeer said it is evaluating acquisition of adjacent land to develop greenfield HPC capacity while maintaining its existing 563 MW Bitcoin mining operation. Management said it believes expected additional capacity of up to 179 MW should not be affected by recent ERCOT discussions, though regulations remain under discussion.\n\nWu characterized the company’s approach as using colocation for very large sites while pursuing GPU-as-a-Service for smaller sites such as Washington State and Tennessee/Knoxville, where Bitdeer believes it can manage deployments directly.\nGPU cloud expansion tied to contracts; Malaysia leasing and U.S. build plans Bitdeer said it continues to see opportunities for GPU-as-a-Service in targeted markets and is expanding its cloud platform in Malaysia by 10–15 MW, building on activity in Singapore serving customers in biomedical, robotics, and gaming. In the U.S., the company plans to add 10 MW of GPU capacity in Washington State and is evaluating a partial conversion of its Knoxville site from Bitcoin mining to GPU cloud.\nManagement stressed that significant U.S. GPU deployments will be backed by committed revenue from enterprise customer contracts and that it does not anticipate deploying large speculative capacity. In response to an analyst question, Basit reiterated that major U.S. AI cloud expansion is dependent on signing contracts.\n\nOn Malaysia, management said the infrastructure is being leased. Wu added the timeline to deploy GPUs depends on infrastructure readiness, noting it was expected around June but that delays are common; he suggested Q3 or Q4 as a more conservative estimate.\nCash flow, financing activity, and accounting change Bitdeer reported net cash used for operating activities of $599.5 million, which management said was primarily driven by SEALMINER supply chain and manufacturing costs, electricity costs, corporate overhead, and interest expense. Net cash generated from investing activities was $97.9 million, including $50.7 million of capital expenditures and $150.6 million in proceeds from cryptocurrency disposals. Net cash generated from financing activities was $454.5 million, driven mainly by $388.5 million of proceeds from convertible senior notes, $168 million in related-party borrowings, and $141.5 million of proceeds from shares sold under its ATM and ELOC program, partially offset by $171.1 million in repayments.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Bitdeer ended the year with $149.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $83.1 million in cryptocurrencies held at cost less impairment, $135.6 million in cryptocurrency receivables held at fair market value, and $1.0 billion in borrowings, excluding derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities tied to convertible senior notes were $501.1 million, which management said reflected non-cash fair value adjustments and did not impact liquidity or operations.\nFor capital spending, Bitdeer said full-year 2025 infrastructure capex totaled $176 million. For 2026, it anticipates $180 million to $200 million of infrastructure spend for crypto mining data center construction, excluding capex for SEALMINERS, GPUs, AI cloud, and colocation.\n\nBasit also noted the company will begin using GAAP instead of IFRS starting in the first quarter of 2026.\nAbout Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ:BTDR) Bitdeer Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:BTDR) is a global digital asset mining and computing services provider focused on delivering secure and efficient hashrate solutions to institutional and retail customers.

One such company, which is seeing renewed interest, is Lumentum Holdings (LITE), as GF Securities highlighted it as one of the key beneficiaries of Nvidia’s co-packaged optics push.\n\nNvidia used this year’s GTC 2025 conference to launch its Quantum-X and Spectrum-X scale-out switch, which will likely be the precursor to further adoption of optical interconnection technology. This, in turn, should see the next-generation 115.2T CPO switch arrive in 2026, with supply chain acceleration through 2027, which should be a boon to optical component companies such as Lumentum.\nMore News from Barchart Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin as Crypto, MSTR Stock Prices Plunge.

Sign up now!\nAbout Lumentum Stock Lumentum Holdings is an optical and photonic products company based in San Jose, California, that provides products to the cloud, networking, and industrial sectors. The company, which has a market capitalization of around $40.1 billion and an enterprise value of $42.1 billion, has clearly established itself as a “mission critical” supplier to the buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nThe stock has seen an explosive move over the last year, trading at $556, with a 52-week range of $45.65-$599.50. The stock has seen an increase of over 600% in weighted alpha, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Relative strength is sitting at 74.39, which highlights the stock’s strong performance.\nThe stock’s valuation has clearly expanded with the move, and investors seem willing to pay the premium to own this stock as it relates to next-generation artificial intelligence networking infrastructure growth. The stock has seen over 94% of institutional ownership, with a short float of 15.8%.\nThe company does not pay a dividend, as it is choosing to reinvest the money into further capacity expansion and next-generation product development.\n\nLumentum Beats on Earnings as AI Demand Accelerates Lumentum’s fiscal second quarter 2026 results were a significant turning point for the company. Revenue was $665.5 million, up considerably from $402.2 million in the year-ago period. Moreover, Lumentum’s GAAP diluted EPS was $0.89, whereas its non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.67, compared with $0.42 in the year-ago period. Lumentum’s margins also improved considerably. GAAP gross margin was 36.1%, while its non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up considerably from the year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is more surprising is the fact that Lumentum’s non-GAAP operating margin was 25.2%, an increase of more than 1,700 points from the year-ago period. It appears the company is entering a new era of high volume and high value related to AI optical demand. Lumentum has identified two significant opportunities in the market, which are optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\n\nLumentum’s backlog for OCS is more than $400 million, whereas the company has announced a multi-hundred-million-dollar CPO order, which is due for the first half of calendar year 2027. Moreover, GF Securities has announced that Nvidia’s supply chain is expected to start ramping up in the second quarter of 2026, with acceleration in the second half of 2026 and into 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for LITE Stock? Analysts hold positive expectations towards the stock with a “Strong Buy” rating consensus for LITE; however, the current price targets don't quite factor in the stock’s recent run-up. The stock’s current mean target price is $525.11, which it has already surpassed, and it has a high price target of $600 and a low price target of $420.\nConsidering the stock’s recent price of around $556, the stock’s mean price target of $525.11 translates into a potential downside of around 5.6%. However, the stock’s street-high price target of $600 implies a potential upside of around 7.9% if AI networking demand continues to surprise on the upside.\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos had a position in: NVDA, LITE.

      "Content": "Is it Too Late to Buy WDC Stock After 305% Explosive Rally in a Year?\n\nShreya Majumder\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:51 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: WDC\n\n^GSPC\n\nSTX\n\nPSTG\n\nSNDK\n\nWestern Digital Corporation’s WDC shares have jumped a whopping 305.2% over the past year, far outpacing the 134.3% rally of the Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry. The stock has also outperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 21.6% and 15.7%, respectively. A major driver behind Western Digital’s rally is soaring demand for data storage from AI and cloud workloads.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company has outdone its cut-throat rival in the HDD business, Seagate Technology Holdings plc STX, and competitors in the broader storage space, such as Pure Storage PSTG, with STX and PSTG rising 301.3% and 12.6%, respectively, during the period. WDC has underperformed Sandisk Corporation SNDK, which climbed 1133.2% in a year.\n\nSeagate is a leading data storage company, with hard disk drives as its core product. Pure Storage, with its all-flash FlashArray and FlashBlade systems, targets high-performance workloads. Growing data demand continues to drive strong prospects for both PSTG and WDC in the expanding storage landscape. In February 2025, WDC split its HDD and Flash businesses into two public companies, with the new SanDisk positioned to leverage its storage expertise to capitalize on AI-driven opportunities.\nWDC has a 52-week high of $296.5. Following a strong rally, investors may wonder whether WDC still has meaningful upside or whether expectations have outpaced fundamentals. Let’s break down the pros and cons to assess the road ahead.\nWDC Reinvents the Hard Drive at Innovation Day 2026 At its Innovation Day 2026, Western Digital, now rebranded as WD, emphasized that the hard drive is far from obsolete. Instead, it is being reinvented as a foundational pillar of AI infrastructure. It introduced a refreshed three-five year financial model and unveiled updated branding aligned with its data center–centric identity. The rapid expansion of AI workloads is driving unprecedented demand for high-capacity, reliable storage as models generate massive volumes of training data, logs, checkpoints and inference datasets.\n\nIn response, Western Digital has outlined a clear, forward-looking roadmap: a 40TB UltraSMR ePMR HDD currently in qualification with two hyperscalers and slated for volume production in the second half of 2026, HAMR-based drives already in qualification with a production ramp expected in 2027, a 60TB ePMR extension that leverages HAMR innovations without increasing power requirements and a 100TB HAMR HDD targeted by 2029. Rather than pushing customers toward a single technology transition, WD is executing a dual-path strategy—maintaining leadership in both ePMR and HAMR to provide flexibility, scalability and a lower-risk migration path as storage demands continue to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nWDC is narrowing the performance gap between HDDs and QLC flash with two industry-first innovations aimed at AI workloads. High Bandwidth Drive technology enables simultaneous multi-head, multi-track read/write operations, delivering up to 2x bandwidth today with a roadmap to 8x without increasing power, and is already in customer validation. Dual Pivot Technology introduces independently operating actuators within a standard 3.5-inch drive, providing up to 2x sequential I/O gains without sacrificing capacity or requiring software changes. It is expected to be available in 2028. Together, these advancements can deliver up to 4x sequential I/O performance, supporting 100TB HDDs while maintaining current IO-per-TB ratios and reducing the need for additional SSD deployment.\n\nIt is also set to expand its Platforms business in 2027 with the introduction of an intelligent software layer and open API designed to streamline large-scale storage deployments. The platform aims to extend hyperscale storage economics to customers managing 200+ petabytes, while reducing qualification risk and accelerating time-to-production. By simplifying the adoption of UltraSMR, ePMR, HAMR and flash solutions, the initiative is expected to lower infrastructure complexity and enhance operational efficiency across enterprise environments.\nImproved Fundamentals Power WDC’s Momentum Amid the AI Boom Western Digital is benefiting from secular growth trends while delivering earnings beats and expanding profitability. For the fiscal second quarter, Western Digital generated $3.02 billion in revenue, up 25% year over year, driven primarily by strong data center demand and increased adoption of high-capacity HDDs. Cloud revenues have become the backbone of WDC’s business, accounting for a hefty and growing share of total sales. It reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 46.1%, up 770 basis points year over year. The upside resulted from a steady transition to higher-capacity drives and rigorous cost management across production facilities and the supply chain.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWDC has used capital return strategies to attract investors. In addition to strong operating performance, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns and disciplined capital allocation. In the fiscal second quarter, the company returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through $615 million in share repurchases and $48 million in dividends during the quarter.\n\nSince launching its capital return program in 2025, it has returned $1.4 billion via buybacks and dividends, highlighting the strength of its cash-generation profile. Recently, its board authorized an additional $4 billion for share repurchases, with approximately $484 million remaining under the previous authorization as of Feb. 2, 2026.\nHowever, it faces mounting near-term risks from macroeconomic instability, including tariffs and escalating trade tensions that could trigger unpredictable demand swings across enterprise and retail channels. The AI-driven storage boom, while supportive of long-term demand, is also straining operations as higher-capacity drives add manufacturing complexity and lengthen production cycles. Elevated debt levels restrict financial flexibility, limiting the company’s ability to pursue strategic acquisitions or invest aggressively in growth. As of Jan. 2, 2026, cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion, while long-term debt (including the current portion) was $4.7 billion.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend of WDC WDC’s estimates revisions are on an upward trajectory currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WDC’s earnings for fiscal 2026 has been revised north 17.4% to $8.96 over the past 60 days, while the same for fiscal 2027 has gone up 54.3% to $15.19.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKey Valuation Metric of WDC Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 21.64 forward earnings compared with 19.1 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Take: Bet on WDC Now In short, the explosion of AI-generated data is driving massive storage demand, positioning Western Digital to benefit significantly. Its competitive outlook through 2026–27 will hinge on the execution of next-generation technologies like HAMR, which could either accelerate growth or create challenges if missteps occur. As agentic AI adoption broadens, storage needs are expected to expand rapidly, supporting long-term demand. Meanwhile, ongoing share buybacks reflect management’s confidence in sustained cash flow.\n\nInvestors should balance long-term technology tailwinds with near-term market risks when making decisions. Flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, WDC seems to be a good buy.

O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\nRelated articles\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The bottom-line figure increased 9.1% year over year.\n\nRevenues of $3.67 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.55%.

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $3.12 billion, exhibiting an increase of 28.7% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 1.2% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Analog Devices metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue by end market- Consumer' to reach $359.11 million. The estimate suggests a change of +11.2% year over year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue by end market- Communications' reaching $423.96 million. The estimate indicates a change of +46.3% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue by end market- Automotive' stands at $801.93 million.

      "Content": "Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\n^GSPC\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Marvell belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMarvell is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +80.9%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.51 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.18 billion and $10.04 billion estimates indicate +41.9% and +22.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Marvell reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.33%.\nOver the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMarvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NAND/memory limits and possible headwinds from a lower PC and cellphone market were the primary concerns going into the report. However, management guided Q1 higher and projected a sequential increase throughout 2026, with a target of revenues reaching $1.2 billion.\nAccording to reports posted on February 3, SIMO expects Q1 revenues to be between $292 million and $306 million, which is higher than the average estimate of $230.44 million. This suggests that the year is off to a far better start than anticipated. Additionally, Silicon Motion expects Q1 operating margins of 16% to 18%, indicating higher profitability.

      "Content": "Memory chip stocks: Why Micron and Sandisk are soaring today as shortage fuels global RAM demand\n\nMichael Grothaus\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:41 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SNDK\n\nMU\n\nWDC\n\nSTX\n\nThis morning, shares of two of the largest computer memory companies that trade on U.S. markets are up yet again.\nMost Read from Fast Company\n\nAI expert predicted AI would end humanity in 2027—now he’s changing his timeline\nAn AI agent just tried to shame a software engineer after he rejected its code\nWomen are reaching a breaking point at work\n\nThe stock prices of Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) and Sandisk Corporation (Nasdaq: SNDK) rose after a Japanese memory firm issued a surprising outlook. Here’s what you need to know.\nStock prices jump as demand continues Shares in several memory chip makers traded on U.S. markets are currently up in premarket trading this morning.\nThe companies include Micron and Sandisk, as well as Western Digital Corporation (Nasdaq: WDC) and Seagate Technology Holdings (Nasdaq: STX).\nAs of this writing, Micron shares are currently up 2.9%, Sandisk shares are up 6.2%, Western Digital shares are up 3%, and Seagate shares are up 2.5%.\nWhile all four companies make memory chips, Western Digital and Seagate primarily focus on computer storage, leaving Micron and Sandisk as the two primary memory chip makers traded on U.S. exchanges.\n\nAnd those two companies are getting a lot of attention, not just today, but as of late, due to the memory chip shortage that global supply chains are currently dealing with.\nAs Fast Company previously reported, there is a global memory chip shortage in 2026. Computer memory, also known as RAM, is the component inside a computer that saves and processes short-term memory (as opposed to long-term memory, which is what hard drives and SSDs store).\nDemand from artificial intelligence (AI) companies is fueling the shortage as they race to get as much RAM as they can get their hands on. These AI companies are currently building many AI data centers, which need powerful servers to run the AI, and those servers require memory to handle instructions.\nAs a result, demand for memory chips is off the charts.\n\nAnd while that is bad for consumers, who are likely to see higher costs for smartphones and laptops this year due to rising memory prices, it’s very good for the companies that make memory, like Micron and SanDisk.\nWhy are memory chip companies seeing their prices rise today? Today’s rise in memory company stock prices isn’t something totally out of the blue. The stock prices of memory companies have been rising for months as news of a memory chip shortage in 2026 spread.\nHowever, the stock price jumps in MU and SNDK today seem to be primarily due to a Japanese company called Kioxia.\n\nStory Continues\nKioxia is a Japanese flash memory supplier, and today, it reported fiscal third-quarter results. Those results, as noted by Investing.com, slightly exceeded expectations. Q4 guidance, on the other hand, blew past expectations.\nMost analysts had expected Kioxia to issue Q4 revenue guidance of ¥648.2 billion (about $4.2 billion). Instead, the company said its Q4 guidance is ¥890 billion at the midpoint (about $5.8 billion).\n\nThat is a massive difference and one that many investors see as evidence that demand for memory chips isn’t going to slow anytime soon. And when demand is high, prices rise, and memory chip companies make more money.\nAnd investors seem to believe that if Kioxia is guiding much higher on revenue than analysts expected, that signals good news for memory chip companies on this side of the Pacific, too.\nMemory chip stocks have had a great 2026 so far Even before today’s Kioxia boost, U.S. memory chip stocks have had a pretty stellar run since the year began.\nAs of yesterday’s market close, Micron was up more than 43% year to date, Sandisk was up 152%, Western Digital was up 58%, and Seagate was up 47%.\nTo put those figures into greater context, the stock market they all trade on, the Nasdaq, has actually declined during the same period.\nAs of yesterday’s close, the Nasdaq Composite was down about 0.7% for the year so far, according to data from Yahoo Finance.\nLooking back even further—over the past 12 months—the returns on these same four memory chip companies have been even more eye-popping.\nIn the last year, Seagate has risen 316%, Micron has jumped 336%, Western Digital is up 425%, and Sandisk has risen a staggering 1,609%. During the same period, the NASDAQ Composite has risen 17.4%\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.com\nSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\nBottom Line Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nStory Continues\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

NTES reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings of $1.57 per ADS (American Depositary Share), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.66%. The figure decreased 24.2% year over year.\n\nRevenues of $3.94 billion increased 7.5% year over year. However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.82%. In domestic currency, revenues increased to RMB27.55 billion, up 3% year over year.\n\nNTES’ Q4 Segment Details NetEase delivered mixed but resilient segment performance in the quarter, led by a 3.4% year-over-year increase in Games and related value-added services revenues to RMB22.0 billion ($3.1 billion). The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher net revenues from self-developed games, such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online, and newly launched games, Where Winds Meet and Marvel Rivals.\n\nYoudao revenues grew 16.8% year over year to RMB1.6 billion ($223.7 million). The year-over-year increase was driven by higher net revenues from its online marketing services and learning services.\n\nNetEase, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NetEase, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NetEase, Inc. Quote\nNetEase Cloud Music recorded a steady 4.7% year-over-year rise to RMB2.0 billion ($281.5 million).\n\nThese gains were partially offset by a 10.4% year-over-year decline in Innovative businesses and others’ revenues to RMB2.0 billion ($292.8 million). The year-over-year decrease reflected an increase in certain inter-segment transaction eliminations.\n\nNTES’ Q4 Operating Highlights Gross profit increased 8.7% year over year to RMB17.7 billion ($2.5 billion).\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 10.9% year over year to RMB9.4 billion ($1.3 billion).\n\nNet income attributable to the company’s shareholders totaled RMB6.2 billion ($892.6 million), while non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders reached RMB7.1 billion ($1.0 billion).\n\nThe effective tax rate increased year over year to 16.4% from 13.4%.\n\nNetEase’s fourth-quarter operational performance highlighted the growing impact of its long-term investment strategy, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence across its game ecosystem. Management reported that AI is now embedded throughout the full development cycle — spanning art, design, programming, animation and quality assurance — enabling higher production scalability and supporting the rollout of AI-driven gameplay innovations in flagship titles.\n\nThe company continued to benefit from strong engagement across its established franchises, underscoring the durability of its long-term operating capabilities. Titles such as Fantasy Westward Journey, Identity V, Eggy Party, Sword of Justice and Where Winds Meet maintained healthy player communities through consistent content updates.\n\nGlobal portfolio expansion remained another key theme. Sword of Justice recorded a solid reception following its international release, while Where Winds Meet surpassed 80 million cumulative players across platforms, indicating broad global traction. Marvel Rivals further strengthened its worldwide presence through high engagement and industry recognition.\n\nMeanwhile, Blizzard-operated titles in China continued to generate sustained engagement through localized content and enriched experiences, achieving record annual revenues and reinforcing NetEase’s strategic positioning in the domestic market.\n\nStory Continues\nNTES’ Balance Sheet & Cash Flow As of Dec. 31, 2025, net cash — including cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits and restricted cash, as well as short-term investments balance, minus short-term and long-term loans — increased to RMB163.5 billion (US$23.4 billion), up from RMB153.2 billion (US$21.5 billion) as of Sept. 30, 2025, reflecting continued balance sheet strength.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities increased to RMB14.8 billion ($2.1 billion) from RMB12.9 billion ($1.8 billion) in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe board of directors declared a fourth-quarter 2025 dividend of $0.232 per share ($1.16 per ADS), to be paid to its shareholders on record as of March 16, 2026.\n\nNTES’ Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Currently, NetEase carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIPG Photonics IPGP, MKS Inc.

      "Content": "Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) Reports Q4 Loss, Beats Revenue Estimates\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTDR\n\nBitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.14. This compares to a loss of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -430.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -481.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\nBITDEER TEC GRP, which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $224.84 million for the quarter ended December 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nBITDEER TEC GRP shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.\nWhat's Next for BITDEER TEC GRP? While BITDEER TEC GRP has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BITDEER TEC GRP was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $203.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.15 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Cricut, Inc. (CRCT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2025. The results are expected to be released on March 3.\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nCricut, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $198.69 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company manufactures a broad range of semiconductor devices, including microprocessors, mobile application processors, baseband processors, network processors, radio frequency modems, microcontrollers, and power management units. The company was established in 2009 due to the strategic shift by AMD, which decided to become a fabless company and spin off its semiconductor manufacturing business. GFS completed its initial public offering listed on Nasdaq in November 2021. The company currently operates manufacturing sites in the following locations: Malta, New York; Burlington, Vermont; Dresden, Germany; and Singapore. Given that most foundry production is concentrated in China and Taiwan, the company believes its global manufacturing footprint is a key differentiator that makes them the ideal partner for local and regional government stakeholders at a time when many regions, in particular the United States and Europe, have passed legislation contemplating significant funding to secure and grow their respective domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. GlobalFoundries' top 10 customers based on wafer shipment volume for fiscal-year 2024 included some of the largest semiconductor companies in the world: AMD, Cirrus Logic Inc., Infineon, MediaTek Inc., NXP, Qualcomm, Qorvo Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Skyworks Solutions Inc., and Sony Group Corp.'s Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Although the stock is trading up 1,220% over the past five years, it's gained only 3% over the past six months.\nWhile the company continues to demonstrate high growth and incredible opportunity, the market appears wary.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nIf you're looking for the next millionaire-maker stock, you might want to look somewhere else. While I don't recommend forgetting Nvidia entirely, and I believe it can still add value to a strong portfolio, risk-tolerant investors might consider other avenues to millionaire status.\nTake, for example, Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Pagaya Technologies (NASDAQ: PGY) . They're both growing at fast rates, but the stocks are trading much cheaper than Nvidia, giving them more room to run.\nThe case for Sandisk Sandisk stock has exploded in value, rising 1,410% over the past year, and the data storage company still has a huge long-term opportunity.\nIt generally delivers robust growth, but with the advent of data centers, for which it offers important infrastructure , growth is accelerating. In the fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended Jan. 2), revenue increased 61% year over year, driven by data center revenue growth of 64% quarter over quarter. Its other businesses, commercial and personal storage solutions, are also thriving.\n\nBeyond its recent stellar performance, management still sees meaningful growth opportunities ahead. It's working with several hyperscalers, and demand is significantly outpacing supply.\nSandisk is benefiting from AI trends right now, but it's underpinned by its dominant consumer-end businesses, providing it with low-risk, long-term growth drivers.\nThe case for Pagaya Pagaya uses AI to drive a credit business, identifying qualified borrowers through its machine learning platform, and bundling loans as asset-backed securities (ABS) to institutional funders. It just announced a new, $800 billion loan securitization funded by 32 investors, and it's the largest U.S. personal loan ABS issuer in the market.\nIt partners with many clients you'll recognize, including U.S. Bank , Visa , and SoFi Technologies , and it has 31 lending partners across a range of product types, including personal loans, credit cards, and auto loans.\nIt helps these partners approve more loans by using AI to evaluate applications and offloading the risk onto the institutional funders. It claims to be able to evaluate an application in less than one second, and it embeds its models straight into the partner platform for seamless transactions.\n\nStory Continues\nPagaya represents the future of financial services, and it's just getting started.\nShould you buy stock in Sandisk right now? Before you buy stock in Sandisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sandisk wasn’t one of them.

Going back to the late 1960s, the S&P 500 and gold have been highly correlated at times and highly negatively correlated at other times. Over that period, gold and silver have had a very negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (USD), as most of the great advances in the metals have occurred during long periods of dollar weakness, and vice versa. One might think that a weak USD would coincide with strong stock-market returns, but that's just not always the case. Starting in 2014, Bitcoin (BTC) was negatively correlated with the USD. The first two massive runs by BTC occurred when the USD was weak, while two of the BTC bear markets occurred when the USD was trending higher. That negative correlation seemed to break in 2024, and there have been periods of risk-on behavior when BTC has been highly correlated with the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). Those times include 2017, March 2020 until November 2021, and a number of times since the end of the 2022 bear market. But the BTC and QQQ correlation has also been busted of late. BTC topped in October 2025 and has witnessed a nasty bear market, while the QQQ has gone sideways since October. John Murphy was the first technician to write about Intermarket Technical Analysis in his 1991 book, and he offers an important lesson: some correlations have (for the most part) lasted for decades and others that simply last until they don't. Investors have to be flexible or the markets will throw them to the wolves.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) was one of the best performers on Wednesday.\nGlobalfoundries jumped to an over one-year high on Wednesday, as investors gobbled up shares after the company swung to profitability last year, marking a 439 percent improvement year-on-year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) said that it swung to a net income of $888 million in 2025 from a $262 million net loss in 2024. This came despite a mere 1 percent uptick in net revenues at $6.79 billion from $6.75 billion year-on-year.\nIn the fourth quarter alone, net income stood at $200 million, reversing a $729 million net loss in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues, however, were flat at $1.83 billion.\nFollowing the results, Globalfoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) saw its intra-day share price on Wednesday jump to as much as $48.88 before trimming a few cents to finish the session just up by 16.32 percent at $48.74 apiece.\nIn other news, Globalfoundries Inc.

      "Content": "Is Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Worth US$227 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TXN\n\nKey Insights The projected fair value for Texas Instruments is US$175 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nTexas Instruments' US$227 share price signals that it might be 29% overvalued\nOur fair value estimate is 20% lower than Texas Instruments' analyst price target of US$219\nDoes the February share price for Texas Instruments Incorporated ( NASDAQ:TXN ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model .\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nThe Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$6.36b\nUS$7.42b\nUS$7.97b\nUS$8.80b\nUS$12.1b\nUS$13.6b\nUS$15.0b\nUS$16.1b\nUS$17.2b\nUS$18.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x7\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 12.53%\nEst @ 9.80%\nEst @ 7.88%\nEst @ 6.54%\nEst @ 5.60%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%\nUS$5.7k\nUS$6.0k\nUS$5.9k\nUS$5.9k\nUS$7.3k\nUS$7.4k\nUS$7.3k\nUS$7.1k\nUS$6.9k\nUS$6.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66b\n\nStory Continues\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 3.4%) ÷ (11%– 3.4%) = US$257b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$257b÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = US$93b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$159b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$227, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nThe Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.639. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Texas Instruments\nSWOT Analysis for Texas Instruments Strength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\nThreat\nDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

      "Content": "QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Soft Earnings Are Actually Better Than They Appear\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:44 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nThe most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nA Closer Look At QUALCOMM's Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On QUALCOMM's Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

      "Content": "Skyworks Solutions' (NASDAQ:SWKS) Conservative Accounting Might Explain Soft Earnings\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:SWKS ) recent soft profit numbers didn't appear to worry shareholders, as the stock price showed strength. Our analysis suggests that investors may have noticed some promising signs beyond the statutory profit figures.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nZooming In On Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Many investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow , but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\".\n\nSkyworks Solutions has an accrual ratio of -0.13 for the year to January 2026. That implies it has good cash conversion, and implies that its free cash flow solidly exceeded its profit last year. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$1.1b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$394.3m. Skyworks Solutions' free cash flow actually declined over the last year, which is disappointing, like non-biodegradable balloons. However, that's not all there is to consider. We can see that unusual items have impacted its statutory profit, and therefore the accrual ratio.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? Skyworks Solutions' profit was reduced by unusual items worth US$59m in the last twelve months, and this helped it produce high cash conversion, as reflected by its unusual items. This is what you'd expect to see where a company has a non-cash charge reducing paper profits. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If Skyworks Solutions doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nStory Continues\nOur Take On Skyworks Solutions' Profit Performance Considering both Skyworks Solutions' accrual ratio and its unusual items, we think its statutory earnings are unlikely to exaggerate the company's underlying earnings power. Based on these factors, we think Skyworks Solutions' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Skyworks Solutions has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nAfter our examination into the nature of Skyworks Solutions' profit, we've come away optimistic for the company. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

The figure increased 68.3% year over year to $443.7 million. System revenues contributed 33.3% to total revenues. The figure increased 60.1% year over year to $221.8 million.\n\nLITE Q3 2026 Guidance Ignites Estimates\n\nFor Q3 fiscal 2026 (ends March), LITE expects non-GAAP revenues between $780 and $830 million vs a prior consensus closer to $700 million. The company expects non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, vs expectations of 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings between $2.15 and $2.35 per share, vs a prior consensus under $1.60.\n\nAnd if any investor or analyst was wondering if this blistering pace was going to slow down any time soon, management said this during the conference call...\n\n&ldquo;Our forward guidance calls for over 85% year-over-year revenue growth, yet we are only at the starting line for two substantial opportunities: optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\"\n\nAnd analysts are already reflecting this optimism in Q4 FY'26 (ends June) with projected growth of 87.5% to $900 million.\n\nThe full-year 2026 sales consensus moved to $2.9 billion, representing over 76% annual growth. And FY'27 is already projected to come in near $4.7 billion, for a 61.5% advance.\n\nAs you would expect, these sales ramps, combined with improving margins, are driving the bottom line estimates higher for both this year and next.\n\nA month ago, the FY26 EPS consensus was at $5.67 and FY27 at $8.29. Today they stand at $7.63 and $14.11, representing growth of 270% and 85%, respectively.\n\nHow NVIDIA Ignited Demand for Optical Interconnect\n\nI'll admit: I was late to the optical party. And I should not have been since I follow NVIDIA so closely. Lessons learned. In December, I profiled Lumentum optical peer Coherent ( COHR ). Here's what I wrote...\n\nWe know NVIDIA is a big customer of Credo Technology ( CRDO ) AECs because CEO Jensen Huang is a big fan of copper for connecting GPUs within rack-scale architectures and Credo has repeatedly showcased its AECs in live demonstrations at the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference (GTC). These demos feature Credo's AECs connecting servers and switches directly to NVIDIA H100 GPUs to create disaggregated, rack-scale GPU clusters.\n\nBut at GTC in March [2025], Jensen announced a collaboration with a purely optical player, Coherent.\n\nOne big driver of investor enthusiasm that helped drive COHR shares from below $70 to over $190 this year was their collaboration with NVIDIA announced at GTC in March.\n\nCoherent and NVIDIA will develop silicon photonics networking switches using co-packaged optics (CPO). This ecosystem will allow AI factories to connect millions of GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA still uses copper wiring within Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale systems to connect GPUs to each other, but to \"scale out\" across the datacenter Jensen Huang recognized the power and speed of optical solutions to connect many racks together for the lowest latency.\n\nThus NVIDIA has several connectivity and networking systems that use optical and photonics solutions and they can be categorized into two main areas: Interconnect Products, including Infiniband and Ethernet protocols, and the upcoming Co-Packaged Optics, like Spectrum-X Photonics Switches.\n\nLITE and TSMC: Co-Design for the Win\n\nLumentum and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ), aka TSMC, aka THE advanced chip foundry, are two of the most critical \"ingredient\" partners in NVIDIA's move toward Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).\n\nTheir collaboration solves a massive physics problem: as AI clusters grow to millions of GPUs, traditional copper wiring and pluggable transceivers consume too much power and generate too much heat.\n\nBy moving optics into the chip package, they reduce power consumption by roughly 3.5x and increase signal integrity significantly. Here is how they work together to build this for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms like Quantum-X and Spectrum-X.\n\nBut TSMC has to provide the \"packaging\" that allows electricity and light to live on the same chip. A major challenge with CPO is that lasers are heat-sensitive. If you put a laser directly next to a hot GPU or Switch ASIC, it will fail.\n\nTSMC&rsquo;s Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) is a 3D packaging process. It allows NVIDIA to stack the Electrical IC (the brain) directly on top of the Photonic IC (the eyes).\n\nMe and the Analysts: Won't Get Fooled Again\n\nAfter I understood this integrated circuit of interdependency, I finally bought Lumentum shares in January at $350 on the pullback from $400. Most analysts were still too timid with estimates and the high price targets were only calling for $450. Heck, Morgan Stanley thought $350 was fair!\n\nAfter earnings, LITE could only manage to kiss $500 and retreat. So I sold some of my position at $485, thinking it may have gone too far, too fast.\n\nIn retrospect, I was foolish to ever doubt the risk appetite for Lumentum (LITE) based solely on the weak reception for its stellar report that day.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious as soon as the next day when everything was falling out of bed on Feb 5 because LITE tested the silly post-earnings low at $426 and reversed higher with a big fat engulfing candle to close above $500!\n\nThen Friday, as the upgrades and delayed reactions poured in, she gaps up to $540 and closes above $550.\n\nThey almost got me again with two kisses of $600 on Monday and Wednesday this week, and then another about-face. But I'm not falling for it this time.\n\nI'm holding my shares for the full realization of what NVIDIA (NVDA) is building for the next five years, where optical components are required at multiple stages and optical providers like LITE and Coherent (COHR) can be involved at different stages of design and fabrication with CPO.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the Street herd gathering around $550 with their PTs...\n\nRosenblatt $580\nJP Morgan $565\nCiti $560\nNeedam $550\nSusquehanna $550\nB. Riley $526\nMizuho $525\nBofA $520\nStifel $480\nBarclays $475 (Equal-Weight)\nUBS $455 (from $215! and stays at Neutral)\n\nSee ya next quarter when Lumentum surprises again and they raise their PTs to $650.\n\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, TSM, CRDO, and LITE shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nKevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks where he runs the TAZR Trader portfolio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Cadence ChipStack AI Super Agent Puts EDA Role In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:12 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CDNS\n\nNVDA\n\nQCOM\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nCadence Design Systems (NasdaqGS:CDNS) has introduced the ChipStack AI Super Agent, described as a first-of-its-kind agentic AI solution for front-end silicon design and verification.\nThe platform uses multiple virtual engineers powered by Cadence’s existing EDA tools, with the company indicating potential productivity gains of up to tenfold in chip design workflows.\nEarly adoption by Nvidia and Qualcomm, along with Cadence’s investment in robotics AI, points to growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to semiconductor and intelligent device development.\n\nFor you as an investor, this update sits at the intersection of electronic design automation and accelerating AI chip development. Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Cadence Design Systems Narrative The ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider Higher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons. You might also track how Cadence links ChipStack with newer areas such as robotics AI, since success there would show that its AI tools can extend beyond classic semiconductor design into a broader intelligent-device market.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Cadence Design Systems, head to the community page for Cadence Design Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The 30-day share price return is 21.35% and the 90-day share price return is 61.59%, while the 1-year total shareholder return of 166.80% signals powerful momentum that current earnings and dividend announcements are helping to reinforce.\nIf SIMO’s recent move has caught your attention, it can be useful to see what else is on the move in related areas. This includes a curated list of 34 AI infrastructure stocks for more ideas tied to data and compute demand trends.\nWith SIMO now trading near US$139.94 and the average analyst target only moderately higher, the key question is whether recent earnings, guidance and dividends leave more upside on the table or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 22.8% Overvalued Simply Wall St's most followed narrative pegs Silicon Motion Technology's fair value at $114.00, which sits well below the recent $139.94 share price, so the market is currently paying a premium to that storyline.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue climb and margin profile need to line up to back that $114.00 tag at an above market discount rate and forward earnings multiple? The full narrative walks through the earnings bridge, the implied scale up in profitability and the valuation gear shift that has to occur to reconcile today’s price with those long range cash flow assumptions.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $114.00 (OVERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, those assumptions can break if intense price competition hits margins harder than expected or if customer concentration leads to lumpier orders than analysts currently model.\nFind out about the key risks to this Silicon Motion Technology narrative.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother View: Earnings Multiple Paints A Different Picture That $114.00 fair value comes from one set of long term cash flow assumptions, but the market is also clearly looking at the current P/E. At 38.8x earnings, SIMO sits below the US Semiconductor industry at 44.6x and peers at 47.7x, yet above its own fair ratio of 30.6x. This suggests investors are paying up for its story.

Management pointed to robust growth from networking, data center, and FPGA product lines as the primary drivers of the outperformance, with CEO Steve Sanghi noting, “Microcontrollers and analog businesses were both about flat sequentially, which was well above the typical seasonal level for December.” The quarter benefited from increased demand in aerospace and defense, while the distribution inventory correction reached a more normalized level, supporting stable operating margins and cash flow.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow did distribution inventory correction impact Microchip's results?\n\nWhat drove Microchip's Q4 revenue outperformance above estimates?\n\nWhy is Microchip prioritizing debt reduction over buybacks?\n\nWhat are Microchip's long-term gross margin improvement prospects?\n\nIs now the time to buy MCHP?

Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\nOur Top 5 Analyst Questions From Microchip Technology’s Q4 Earnings Call Matthew Prisco (Cantor Fitzgerald) asked about the sustainability of above-seasonal growth and the drivers behind backlog strength. CFO Eric Bjornholt explained that distribution inventory is largely corrected, with strong backlog and bookings for the next quarter, but noted visibility beyond the current quarter remains limited due to short lead times.\nVivek Arya (Bank of America Securities) questioned the timeline for reaching the company’s long-term gross margin target. CEO Steve Sanghi and CFO Bjornholt said margin improvement will be gradual, with normalization of inventory reserves and underutilization charges, but did not commit to a specific timeframe.\nJim Snyder (Goldman Sachs) inquired about customer inventory behavior and the potential for restocking. Sanghi indicated restocking has not started broadly, but increased expedite requests suggest customer inventories are nearing consumption rates, especially as supply tightens.\nBlayne Curtis (Jefferies) asked about the sustainability of licensing and other segment revenue, and the impact on gross margin. Management clarified the licensing benefit will not repeat, but other product lines—including memory and FPGA—are expected to remain strong, supporting gross margin.\nChris Caso (Wolfe Research) pressed on the prioritization of debt reduction over share buybacks. Sanghi and Bjornholt emphasized a conservative approach, with no plans for repurchases until leverage is significantly reduced, following lessons from the recent downcycle.\n\nStory Continues\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters In coming quarters, the StockStory team will be monitoring (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from automotive Ethernet and industrial connectivity design wins, (2) normalization of customer and channel inventories and its effect on order patterns and lead times, and (3) progress toward improving gross margin through a richer product mix and higher factory utilization. Developments in data center and aerospace/defense segments will also be key to tracking growth.\nMicrochip Technology currently trades at $80.73, up from $78.04 just before the earnings.

Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, Texas Instruments’s sales grew at a mediocre 4.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the semiconductor sector. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. EPS Trending Down We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\nSadly for Texas Instruments, its EPS declined by 1.8% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 4.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nAs you can see below, Texas Instruments’s margin dropped by 19.6 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it’s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Texas Instruments’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 14.7%.\nFinal Judgment Texas Instruments isn’t a terrible business, but it doesn’t pass our bar. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 34.5× forward P/E (or $226.03 per share). While this valuation is fair, the upside isn’t great compared to the potential downside. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere. We’d recommend looking at one of our top software and edge computing picks .\n\nStory Continues\nStocks We Would Buy Instead of Texas Instruments The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Kadant (+351% five-year return).

      "Content": "Intel AI Push Deepens With SambaNova Bet And New GPU Chief\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 5:08 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSANS.PVT\n\nQCOM\n\nGet insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Intel Narrative The SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

      "Content": "Do Marvell (MRVL) ESOP Share Filings Hint At A Deeper AI Data Center Strategy Shift?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 2:09 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nIn recent days, Marvell Technology filed two employee stock ownership plan-related shelf registrations to offer a combined 4,373,572 common shares worth about US$333.80 million.\nThese filings come as Marvell leans further into AI-focused data center silicon, following acquisitions that deepen its role in hyperscaler infrastructure.\nWe’ll now examine how Marvell’s ESOP-related share registrations, alongside its expanding AI data center role, shape the existing investment narrative.\n\nOutshine the giants: these 26 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement .\nMarvell Technology Investment Narrative Recap To own Marvell today, you need to believe its pivot toward AI and cloud data center silicon can offset rising revenue concentration risk in a handful of hyperscale customers. Near term, the key catalyst remains AI data center demand and large custom silicon ramps, while the biggest risk is any slowdown or insourcing by those same customers. The new ESOP-related shelf registrations look immaterial to that core thesis and do not change the main risk reward balance.\nThe most relevant context for these ESOP filings is Marvell’s recently reported Q3 FY2026 results, where AI-driven data center revenue helped deliver record US$2,074.5 million in quarterly sales. That print underlined how central AI infrastructure has become to the story and why investors are focused on upcoming catalysts like the March 5 earnings call and updates on hyperscaler programs, rather than on routine share registration activity tied to employee ownership plans.\n\nYet despite this strong AI momentum, investors should still be aware that Marvell’s heavy dependence on hyperscaler data center capex leaves the business exposed if those spending plans suddenly change...\nRead the full narrative on Marvell Technology (it's free!)\nMarvell Technology's narrative projects $12.1 billion revenue and $2.9 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 18.7% yearly revenue growth and a $3.0 billion earnings increase from -$103.4 million today.\nUncover how Marvell Technology's forecasts yield a $116.27 fair value , a 42% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the most optimistic analysts were assuming revenue could climb about 23.5 percent annually to roughly US$13.6 billion by 2028, yet the latest AI centric news and Marvell’s growing dependence on hyperscaler capex show how sharply opinions can differ and why you should weigh several viewpoints before deciding what this stock is really worth.\nExplore 26 other fair value estimates on Marvell Technology - why the stock might be worth as much as 89% more than the current price!\n\nStory Continues\nBuild Your Own Marvell Technology Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "UBS Keeps a Neutral Rating on QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM)\n\nFatima Gulzar\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 11:41 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nUBS\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is among the 12 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy Right Now .\nTheFly stated on January 26, 2026, that UBS kept its rating at Neutral and reduced its price objective for QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) from $185 to $160.\nMizuho also lowered the corporation’s price target that day from $175 to $160. It maintained a Neutral rating. Mizuho predicted that global handset shipments will drop 4% year over year in 2026, with additional declines anticipated in the second half. This is due to memory constraints and pricing pressures. The downgrade came after an industry call on handsets.\n\nOn February 5, 2026, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) expected second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, both lower than LSEG projections. The firm attributed a global memory chip shortage to impacting smartphone users. After-hours trading saw a 9% decline in shares, which have now dropped more than 13% this year as of February 5, 2026. According to CEO Cristiano Amon, memory limits were the only reason for the projection failure. OEMs, especially in China, were cutting back on inventory as memory prices rose across the mobile device industry.\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and distributes semiconductors, software, and wireless technology solutions.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "KLA Shares Drop 15% Post Q2 Earnings: Should You Buy on the Dip?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nASML\n\nAMAT\n\nACLS\n\nKLA Corporation KLAC shares dropped 15.1% post second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Jan. 29. The plunge can be attributed to the company’s not-so-impressive guidance, as well as operational headwinds. KLA now expects third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $3.35 billion (+/- $150 million), reflecting a modestly weak product mix on a sequential basis. The guidance also reflects the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in KLA’s image processing computers that ship with its systems, thereby hurting gross margin. Increasing lead times of its products due to supply constraints and negative tariff impact, roughly 100 bps, are headwinds in the near term.\n\nSo, what should investors do with KLA shares? Let’s find out?\n\nKLAC Shares Outperform Sector, Peers KLA shares have jumped 90.6% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 23.1% and the Zacks Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry’s appreciation of 37.4%. KLA is benefiting from its dominant process control market share, strong AI infrastructure investment and momentum in advanced packaging.\n\nThe company has outperformed peers, including Applied Materials AMAT, ASML Holding ASML and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, in the past year. Shares of Applied Materials, ASML Holding and Axcelis have returned 81.9%, 87% and 48.1%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nKLAC Stock’s Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKLA Prospect Rides on Strong Advanced Packaging Growth KLA is benefiting from strong demand for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging, which is driving top-line growth. Advanced packaging revenues are expected to grow mid-to-high teens on a year-over-year basis in 2026. Strong investments in WFE and advanced packaging represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has become a new market for KLA, which is currently worth $11 billion and growing faster than core WFE.\n\nKLA’s robust portfolio and its leadership in process control systems are enabling customers to manage increasing design complexity. Process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp-up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs.\n\nMoreover, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs. This has put customers under pressure to deliver performance, volume and time to market, resulting in strong demand for advanced process control. This aids KLA’s prospects as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology and yield optimization solutions. This bodes well for KLAC’s top-line growth.\n\nKLAC expects the core WFE market to grow in the high single to low double digits in 2026, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025. The company expects the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to roughly $12 billion for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus its forecast for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nKLAC’s 2026 Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Positive Trend The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $36.58 per share, up 3% over the past 30 days and indicating 9.9% growth from 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $13.39 billion, suggesting 10.1% growth from the 2025’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Corporation Price and Consensus KLA Corporation price-consensus-chart | KLA Corporation Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.12 per share, up 2.4% over the past 30 days and indicating 8.4% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting 9.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nKLA Shares are Trading at a Premium KLAC shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), KLAC is trading at 33.83X, higher than the broader sector and peers. The broader sector is trading at 26.08X while Applied Materials and Axcelis trade at 32.21X and 20.17X, respectively. However, ASML is pricey with a P/E multiple of 41.48.\nKLAC Stock’s Valuation\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, KLA is currently trading above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\nKLA Stock Trades Above 50-Day & 200-Day SMAs\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKLAC Stock is a Buy Now KLA benefits from strong demand for advanced packaging despite increasing lead times and conservative guidance. Robust AI demand bodes well for KLAC’s prospects and justifies a premium valuation.\n\nKLA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which suggests that investors should start accumulating the stock right now as the dip offers a massive opportunity.

Meanwhile, the Federal Government shed -34K jobs last month, and Financial Services lost -22K.\n\nIdeal as much of these headline numbers are, there are a few flies in the ointment. Chief among them was a reassessment of 2025 job growth, which ended the year +584K but has since been revised to a more paltry +181K.

      "Content": "TSEM: Tower Revises Its Model to Higher Investment and High Margins\n\nZacks Small Cap Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 8:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSEM\n\n0981.HK\n\nTSM\n\nUMC\n\nBy Lisa Thompson\nNASDAQ:TSEM\nREAD THE FULL TSEM RESEARCH REPORT\nAs demand exceeds capacity, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) has decided to accelerate its investment as it sees margins continue to expand from the sale of new products. It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.\n\nFor Q1 2026, Tower guided to revenues of $412 million plus or minus 5%, which results in slightly accelerating year-over-year growth.\nAs of last night’s closing price, the company trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.3 EV to estimated sales for 2027. Since its low at $28.54 on April 4, 2025, the stock has rocketed 379%. TSEM trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.5 EV to estimated sales for 2027, higher than its peers, who trade at an average of 5.7x. However, if we look at the components of that average, we see they diverge, with SMIC and Taiwan Semiconductor averaging 8.4x, while slower-growing Global Foundries and United Microelectronics are at or under 3.0x. At 8.4xs, TSEM stock would be worth approximately $175 per share using 2027 revenues. To be conservative, we are raising our price target to $150 as TSEM works to reach those revenue numbers.\n\nQ4 2025 Results\nThe biggest revenue contribution in the quarter again came from RF infrastructure, surpassing RF Mobile. In Q4, RF Infrastructure grew 102% to $141 million, up from $107 million in Q3 2025, and showed growth of 81.3% for the year. SiPh was $95 million of that (including some NREs) for the quarter and grew 70%. For the year, SiPh contributed $228 million compared to $106 million the year before. The growth rates are accelerating as well as the percent contribution to total sales. As they become a bigger portion of total revenues, growth should continue to accelerate.\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

      "Content": "MRVL Declines 8% in 3 Months: Time to Hold or Fold the Stock?\n\nSubham Roy\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 7:48 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nMarvell Technology MRVL shares have lost 8.2% in the past three months, underperforming its Computer and Technology sector, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and peers like Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Micron Technology MU.\nShares of Broadcom and NVIDIA have lost 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively, while Micron Technology shares have surged 52.4%. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry appreciated 2.7% in the same time frame compared with no change for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nMRVL Three-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven this decline in a month, the question arises: Should investors buy, sell or hold the stock at present? Let’s dive deeper into the fundamentals and financials of the MRVL stock to answer this question.\nSlowdown in Revenue Growth Rate is a Concern for MRVL Marvell Technology’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 signals softer near-term growth. The company guided revenues of $2.2 billion (+/- 5%), representing just 21% year-over-year growth, a slowdown compared to recent quarters. The top line has been in a declining trend for the past three quarters.\nDespite strong demand for electro-optics, management expects data center revenues to grow 20% year over year in the fourth quarter, suggesting a decelerating growth rate in the past six quarters. One of the major reasons for this decelerating growth is the growing presence of players like Broadcom and Astera Labs in the AI connectivity space.\n\nBroadcom is strong in networking, data center, broadband, Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHYs and switches. In the communications segment, Broadcom mainly provides high-speed connectivity, optical or wireline networking equipment, cable or broadband IC portfolio, PCIe switch and retimer.\nMarvell Technology’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with a 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system. The volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\nThe company recently launched the Golden Cable initiative to accelerate and expand the Active Electrical Cable ecosystem for faster deployment of AI infrastructure by cloud and hyperscaler customers. MRVL is also gaining from the adoption of scale-up switches that connect AI accelerators within and across racks, requiring multi-terabit bandwidth and ultra-low latency.\n\nMRVL Leverages Its Peers to Offer AI Products The rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Micron Technology and NVIDIA, are in the AI processing, networking and memory space. Besides semiconductor partners, MRVL has collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nStory Continues\nMicron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth. MRVL has collaborated with MU on HBM design and integration for AI compute platforms to provide a custom HBM compute architecture.\n\nThe growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Marvell Technology has partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution.\nTogether with its deep expertise in the AI semiconductor space and strong partner base, the company is able to keep its operating costs low and grow its top line at the same time, hence benefiting from a high growth rate in the bottom line. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, non-GAAP operating expenses grew just 4% year over year, even as revenues climbed 37% year over year, showcasing disciplined cost management.\nThe consensus estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 81%. The estimate has remained unchanged for the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMRVL Stock Trades at a Discount MRVL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/S) ratio of 6.87, well below the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry average of 8.4, indicating that the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold MRVL Stock for Now Although MRVL’s top line is showing a declining growth rate, the company has been able to retain its earnings growth through prudent cost measures. Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Considering these factors, we suggest investors retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

Investor attention is firmly focused on its surging semiconductor systems business that is driven by the AI market.\nApplied Materials has been experiencing growing traction for its foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), flash memory and advanced packaging wafer fabrication equipment as a rising number of semiconductor chip manufacturing companies are producing high quality chips used in AI and high performance computing.\n\nClick here to know how AMAT’s overall fiscal first-quarter results are likely to be.\nGrowth in the Semiconductor Systems Segment to Propel AMAT The semiconductor systems business, which is the largest contributor to AMAT’s top line, grew 4.5% throughout fiscal 2025, with strength across flash memory, DRAM and logic. AMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million.\nApplied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, DRAM revenues grew nearly 16% year over year. These factors are likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, lifting revenues of AMAT’s semiconductor systems segment. In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\n\nAMAT’s Display and Applied Global Services to Surge in FY26 AMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\nTraction in advanced form factors like thin, light, curved and flexible displays, and new use cases like augmented and virtual reality are at the core of AMAT’s display segment’s growth story. The gross margin of AMAT’s display business hit the highest mark in the past 25 years, coming in at 48.8%, growing 120 basis points year over year. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

      "Content": "Gold.com and Qualcomm have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:55 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nGC=F\n\nGOLD\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Gold.com GOLD as the Bull of the Day and Qualcomm QCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\nBull of the Day: A recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nStory Continues\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nBear of the Day: Qualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\nBottom Line\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nAdditional content: Micron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "1 Investment Firm Just Loaded Up on Yeti Shares. Here's why.\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\nIDCC\n\nSKWD\n\nACLS\n\nWhat happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated Feb. 10, 2026, Reinhart Partners, LLC. increased its position in Yeti by 373,641 shares during the fourth quarter of 2025. The estimated value of the additional shares acquired was $14.37 million, based on the average quarterly closing price. At quarter-end, the total Yeti position was valued at $134.08 million, up approximately $45.76 million from the prior period, reflecting both trading and price movement effects.\nWhat else to know After this buy, Yeti accounted for approximately 4.02% of 13F reportable AUM at the end of December 2025.\nTop holdings after the filing, other than Yeti:\nUNK: FCNCA: $167 million (approximately 5.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SIMO: $145.9 million (approximately 4.4% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: IDCC: $133 million (approximately 4.0% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: ACLS: $127.7 million (approximately 3.8% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: SKWD: $123.5 million (approximately 3.7% of AUM)\nAs of Feb. 10, 2026, shares were priced at $47.06, up approximately 30.2% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 by 15.79 percentage points.\n\nCompany overview Metric\nValue\nMarket capitalization\n$3.66 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.83 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$160.31 million\nPrice (as of market close February 10, 2026)\n$47.06\n\nCompany snapshot Yeti offers hard and soft coolers, drinkware, bags, outdoor living gear, and accessories primarily under the YETI and Rambler brands.\nThe company generates revenue through direct-to-consumer e-commerce, independent retailers, and international distribution channels.\nIt targets outdoor enthusiasts, recreation consumers, and specialty retail shoppers in the United States and select international markets.\nYeti designs premium coolers and drinkware for outdoor enthusiasts, leveraging a multi-channel strategy to reach a broad consumer base. The company is a leading designer and distributor of premium outdoor products, focusing on durable coolers and innovative drinkware. Its consistent growth reflects strong positioning within the leisure and outdoor recreation market.\n\nWhat this transaction means for investors This new filing comes about one week before Yeti releases fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2025 financial results on Thursday, Feb. 19. Investment firm Reinhart Partners is clearly confident in the business. But interested investors should watch the upcoming report closely.\nThat’s because Yeti’s business has been under pressure recently. Its products are certainly discretionary for consumers who may be looking to tighten their financial spending. That’s not the company’s only issue, either.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter, Yeti’s adjusted earnings per share decreased 14%, even as net sales increased 2%. The company cited the “unfavorable net impact from higher tariff costs in the third quarter” as the reason. Yeti’s international sales actually increased by 14%, while sales in the U.S. declined 1%.\n\nThe company continues to innovate, however. Management is confident enough to increase its share repurchase target to $300 million. Yeti also updated fiscal year guidance slightly to the high end of prior projections for sales and free cash flow.\nYeti is also transforming its supply chain and diversifying its manufacturing footprint to address tariff and supplier issues. That work is likely why Reinhart Partners added more Yeti to the portfolio. The upcoming fourth-quarter report will help investors determine whether tariff and supply chain headwinds are now in the past.\nShould you buy stock in Yeti right now?

      "Content": "1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock to Buy Now With $150\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nInvestors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nAI creates near-term headwinds but long-term tailwinds The growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nShould you buy stock in Qualcomm right now? Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SIMO\n\n^GSPC\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this chip company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Silicon Motion belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSilicon Motion is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +90%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.7%. This estimate has changed +21.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.93 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Silicon Motion is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Silicon Motion.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Silicon Motion, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $299.65 million indicates a year-over-year change of +80%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.24 billion and $1.41 billion estimates indicate +39.5% and +14.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Silicon Motion reported revenues of $278.46 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.7%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.61%. The EPS surprise was -2.33%.\nOver the last four quarters, Silicon Motion surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSilicon Motion is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Silicon Motion. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $2.00\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 2:41 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MPWR\n\nThe board of Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. ( NASDAQ:MPWR ) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $2.00 on the 15th of April, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 0.7%.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems' Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, Monolithic Power Systems' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 113.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Monolithic Power Systems\nMonolithic Power Systems Has A Solid Track Record The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2016, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $8.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 26% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Monolithic Power Systems has been growing its earnings per share at 28% a year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Monolithic Power Systems could prove to be a strong dividend payer.\nWe Really Like Monolithic Power Systems' Dividend In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Monolithic Power Systems that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

      "Content": "Astera Labs (ALAB) Is Up 26.4% After Profitability Milestone And Israel AI R&D Push Has The Bull Case Changed?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 1:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ALAB\n\nRMBS\n\nIn early February 2026, Astera Labs reported past fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results showing higher sales and a move to profitability, issued first-quarter 2026 guidance, expanded its AI-focused R&D footprint with a new design center in Israel, and announced a CFO transition from Michael Tate to former Rambus finance chief Desmond Lynch effective March 2, 2026.\nTogether, these updates highlight Astera Labs’ efforts to deepen its role in AI and cloud infrastructure through expanded engineering capacity, executive bench strength, and new collaborations with major technology and cloud providers.\nNext, we’ll examine how the Israel R&D expansion and related AI connectivity ambitions may influence Astera Labs’ existing investment narrative.\n\nWe've uncovered the 14 dividend fortresses yielding 5%+ that don't just survive market storms, but thrive in them.\nAstera Labs Investment Narrative Recap To own Astera Labs, you have to believe AI and cloud infrastructure will keep demanding high performance connectivity and that Astera can stay at the center of that buildout. Right now, the key near term catalyst is continued product pull through from hyperscalers, while the biggest risk is how dependent that growth is on a concentrated, highly competitive AI capex cycle. The latest earnings beat, Israel R&D expansion, and CFO handoff look supportive rather than thesis changing in the short term.\n\nAmong the recent updates, the new Israel design center feels most relevant, because it directly ties into Astera Labs’ AI connectivity roadmap and efforts to broaden its technology and customer reach. If the expanded engineering footprint accelerates adoption of Scorpio switches and related fabrics, it could reinforce the current catalyst of rising content per AI accelerator, while also indirectly addressing customer concentration risk by enabling more use cases and deployment types across data centers.\nYet, against all the AI enthusiasm, investors should also be aware of how exposed Astera Labs remains to any slowdown or reset in hyperscaler spending on...\nRead the full narrative on Astera Labs (it's free!)\nAstera Labs' narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $393.5 million earnings by 2028.\n\nUncover how Astera Labs' forecasts yield a $199.15 fair value , a 9% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Some of the lowest analysts were already cautious, assuming revenue of about US$1.4 billion and earnings near US$294 million by 2028, and see risks like hyperscalers shifting to internal solutions much more harshly than the consensus. This new Israel expansion and guidance could push those views to evolve in either direction, so it is worth weighing how much downside or upside you personally see in those more pessimistic assumptions.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 20 other fair value estimates on Astera Labs - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!\nBuild Your Own Astera Labs Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Content": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Skyworks and RF Industries\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 1:07 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nRFIL\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Skyworks SWKS and RF Industries RFIL.\nIndustry: Electronics - Radio Frequency\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2847030/2-radio-frequency-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-industry\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry participants like Skyworks and RF Industries are benefiting from the continued adoption of WiFi 7, as well as the rapid proliferation of the edge IoT, AI data centers and automotive electrification. The growing need for faster connections, low latency, and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots.\n\nThe democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry participants. Nevertheless, industry players are facing a challenging demand environment that has resulted in inventory buildup. Sluggish capital spending by telecom carriers has been a headwind. Industry participants are suffering from heightened global macroeconomic uncertainties. Weakness in end-markets like automotive, industrial and infrastructure has been concerning.\nIndustry Description\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in the congested RF spectrum.\n\nThey serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.\n3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF Industry\nAccelerated 5G Deployment Acts as a Tailwind : The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which is expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. The growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects.\n\nStory Continues\nInnovation Opens up Business Avenues : The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense.\n\nThe diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. The evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. The rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. Industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.\nGrowing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospects : Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #20, which places it in the top 8% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nThe group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\nThe industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2026 have moved up by 7.4% since June 30, 2025.\n\nGiven the bright prospect, there are a few stocks worth watching in the industry. However, before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 and Sector\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry has underperformed the S&P 500 and its broader sector over the past year. The industry has declined 9.6% over this period against the S&P 500&rsquo;s return of 16.8% and the broader sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 21.8%.\nIndustry's Current Valuation\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing the Semiconductors - Radio Frequency stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.51X, lower than the S&P 500&rsquo;s 22.98X and the sector&rsquo;s 25.91X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.71X and as low as 7.89X, the median being 14.65X.\n2 Radio Frequency Stocks to Watch\nRF Industries : Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have moved up 111.8% in the past year.

      "Content": "ENTG Q4 Deep Dive: Advanced Node Momentum and Facility Optimization Shape Outlook\n\nKayode Omotosho\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:32 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ENTG\n\nSemiconductor materials supplier Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q4 CY2025, but sales fell by 3.1% year on year to $823.9 million. Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was optimistic at $805 million at the midpoint, 2.3% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.70 per share was 5.4% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy ENTG? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\nEntegris (ENTG) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $823.9 million vs analyst estimates of $812.4 million (3.1% year-on-year decline, 1.4% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $0.70 vs analyst estimates of $0.66 (5.4% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $228.1 million vs analyst estimates of $220.3 million (27.7% margin, 3.5% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $805 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $786.9 million\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.74 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.63\nOperating Margin: 12.7%, down from 17.7% in the same quarter last year\nInventory Days Outstanding: 126, down from 129 in the previous quarter\nMarket Capitalization: $20.23 billion\n\nStockStory’s Take Entegris delivered fourth-quarter results that were well received by the market, as revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share surpassed Wall Street’s expectations despite a modest year-over-year sales decline. Management credited the positive performance to continued strength in advanced node semiconductor applications, particularly in CMP consumables, liquid filtration, and selective etch products. CEO David Reeder highlighted that the company’s operational execution, including increased production volumes and disciplined working capital management, supported both margin stability and improved free cash flow.\n\nLooking ahead, Entegris’ guidance reflects optimism around industry recovery, driven by anticipated node transitions in both logic and memory, as well as growth in advanced packaging and AI-related applications. Management emphasized the ramp-up of new facilities in Taiwan and Colorado, and enhanced local manufacturing in Asia as key to meeting customer demand. CFO Linda LaGorga noted, “Higher operating cash flow in combination with reduced CapEx is expected to increase free cash flow again in 2026,” underscoring the company’s focus on improving leverage and capital efficiency.\nKey Insights from Management’s Remarks Management attributed the quarter’s performance to advanced node demand, facility ramp-ups, and ongoing cost controls, while noting that market recovery and technology transitions set the stage for future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nAdvanced node traction: Entegris secured strong positions of record (PORs) in leading-edge logic and memory nodes, particularly for CMP consumables and deposition materials, which management expects will increase the company’s content per wafer and drive future growth.\nFacility optimization: The company continued to ramp production at its new Taiwan facility and expects substantial customer qualification at its Colorado site in 2026, while rationalizing its manufacturing footprint by exiting a Pennsylvania plant and planning additional closures to improve utilization.\nChina-localization strategy: Management increased the proportion of products supplied to China from Asia-based facilities, aiming for 85% in the first quarter and targeting further gains, which enhances supply assurance and competitiveness in the region.\nFree cash flow focus: Improved free cash flow margin, supported by disciplined working capital and lower capital expenditures, enabled debt reduction and will be a key metric in both short-term and long-term incentive plans.\nSegment performance divergence: Materials Solutions saw sequential growth on strong advanced deposition demand for NAND, while Advanced Purity Solutions faced year-over-year declines due to headwinds in fluid handling, partially offset by robust liquid filtration sales.\n\nDrivers of Future Performance Entegris’ outlook is shaped by anticipated industry node transitions, facility ramp efficiency, and the ongoing recovery in semiconductor capital expenditures.\nNode transition benefits: Management expects content per wafer to increase as customers transition to new logic and memory nodes, especially two-nanometer devices and high-layer-count NAND, supporting unit-driven revenue growth.\nFacility ramp and cost leverage: Ongoing production increases in Taiwan and Colorado are poised to improve gross margins through better utilization, while further manufacturing rationalization aims to reduce fixed costs.\nCapEx and market risk: A recovery in industry fab construction and wafer fab equipment spending is critical for capital-expenditure-driven revenue, but management flagged the timing and scale of these investments as a wild card that could impact growth rates.\n\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters In the coming quarters, the StockStory team will be watching (1) the pace of advanced node adoption and content-per-wafer gains, (2) the operational ramp and customer qualification of new facilities in Taiwan and Colorado, and (3) evidence of recovery in fab construction-related demand driving improvements in capital-expenditure-sensitive product lines. Progress on local-for-local manufacturing in China and further rationalization of the production footprint will also be important to track.\nEntegris currently trades at $134.72, up from $122.39 just before the earnings.

      "Content": "Lam Research Reshapes Leadership And Partnerships For Next Generation Chip Demand\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:06 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: LRCX\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nLam Research announced a set of senior leadership changes, including the retirement of its COO and the appointment of Sesha Varadarajan to the role.\nThe company added Dr. Anirudh Devgan, a key figure in electronic design automation, to its board of directors.\nLam also entered a multi year partnership with CEA Leti to work on advanced specialty technology devices and semiconductor materials.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:LRCX, these leadership and partnership moves come on top of a share price of $226.61 and very large multiyear share returns, including about 353.0% over 3 years. The stock is also up 22.5% year to date and about 174.7% over 1 year, which places these corporate decisions in the context of a company that has already seen strong recent market interest.\nBoard level changes and deep technical collaborations can influence how Lam Research positions itself in semiconductor equipment over the coming years. If you follow the stock, a key question is how this refreshed leadership team and new partner relationships shape Lam’s role in next generation chip manufacturing technologies.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Lam Research by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Lam Research.\nDoes the team leading Lam Research have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\nFor you as an investor, the key takeaway is that Lam is tightening the link between executive decision making and the chip design ecosystem while also pushing its process technology into more complex device types. The promotion of long time insider Sesha Varadarajan to COO suggests operational continuity in core etch and deposition tools, which sit at the center of AI and memory manufacturing. Bringing Cadence CEO Anirudh Devgan onto the board ties Lam more closely to electronic design automation, an area that influences how next generation chips are architected before they ever hit a fab. The multi year partnership with CEA Leti broadens Lam’s R&D reach across MEMS, 3D imaging, RF, photonics and optical interconnects, areas that matter for AI hardware, advanced data centers and high performance computing. Taken together with recent earnings strength, guidance and ongoing dividends and buybacks, these leadership and partnership steps frame a company that is actively aligning its internal structure and research pipeline with where complex chip manufacturing is heading, while still leaving you to judge execution quality and competitive outcomes against peers like Applied Materials, KLA and Tokyo Electron.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Lam Research Narrative The CEA Leti partnership and Varadarajan’s operational role tie directly into the narrative that Lam’s process technology in advanced packaging, etch and deposition can support higher wafer fab equipment demand linked to AI and memory cycles.\nAt the same time, board and C suite changes add another layer of execution risk to a story that already leans on continued leadership in complex architectures such as 3D NAND and advanced packaging, where rivals like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron are also investing heavily.\nThe appointment of an EDA focused board member and the push into specialty devices and compound semiconductors extend beyond the original narrative, which centers more on core wafer fab equipment and may not fully capture optionality in areas like RF filters, photonics and quantum related applications.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Lam Research to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Executive transition risk as Lam moves from long serving COO Patrick Lord to Sesha Varadarajan. Any disruption in operations, product execution or customer support is likely to show up quickly in a cyclical equipment market.\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged at least one risk, and the partnership and leadership changes sit against a backdrop of customer concentration and strong competition from equipment vendors such as Applied Materials and KLA that could pressure share of future spend.\n🎁 The CEA Leti agreement broadens Lam’s reach into specialty technologies such as MEMS, 3D imaging, RF and photonics, which can support its goal of serving a wider range of AI and high performance computing related device needs.\n🎁 Recent earnings strength, active capital returns through dividends and buybacks, and a board that now includes a leading EDA executive give Lam additional tools to pursue opportunities in advanced memory and packaging where it already has a meaningful presence.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track how smoothly the COO handover progresses, for example through future commentary on system shipments, service performance and customer satisfaction. Board level influence is slower to read, so watch for any shift in Lam’s product roadmap or R&D focus that ties chip design requirements more tightly to its equipment offerings. On the CEA Leti side, pay attention to concrete milestones such as joint demonstrators, published results or early customer engagements in areas like RF filters, photonics or compound semiconductor processes that use Lam’s etch and deposition tools. Finally, set the leadership and partnership story alongside future quarterly results, guidance and competitive commentary from Applied Materials, KLA and Tokyo Electron to see whether Lam’s positioning in AI infrastructure, memory and specialty technologies continues to align with where capital spending is flowing.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Lam Research, head to the community page for Lam Research to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 50.79% contrasts with a modest 5 year total shareholder return of 4.78%, hinting that enthusiasm around edge AI launches and fresh financing is a relatively recent shift in market sentiment.\nIf edge AI and power efficient chips are on your radar, it could be a good moment to widen your watchlist with our screener of 33 AI infrastructure stocks .\nAfter such a sharp move in the share price and with a fresh edge AI story in the spotlight, the real question now is whether Microchip still trades at a discount or if the market is already pricing in future growth.\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 12% Undervalued At $76.86, the most followed narrative pegs Microchip Technology's fair value closer to $86.96, framing the recent AI driven enthusiasm against longer term assumptions.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what sits behind that fair value gap? Revenue climbing faster than the wider market, margin rebuild, and a future earnings profile that assumes a premium valuation. The exact mix of growth, profitability and required return is already mapped out. You just have to see how bold those forecasts really are.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $86.96 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, there are still pressure points to keep in mind, including elevated inventory and factory underutilization charges, as well as substantial debt that can constrain flexibility.\nFind out about the key risks to this Microchip Technology narrative.\nAnother Way to Look at Valuation There is a twist here.

Small-scale bioprocessing is used mostly in R&D, process optimization, pilot studies, and early-stage clinical manufacturing where the main factors for testing and refining processes are flexibility, speed, and precise control.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transition to personalized medicine and targeted therapies has resulted in the demand for manufacturing solutions that are flexible and scalable, able to connect small-scale innovation with large-scale production. Additionally, the provision of regulatory support, the rise in investments in biomanufacturing infrastructure, and the expansion of biopharmaceutical production – especially in the Asia Pacific region – are significantly contributing to the large and small-scale bioprocessing market’s overall growth.\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing Market Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/request-for-customization/?reportid=80383\nWhat are the Factors That Have a Significant Contribution to the Growth of the Large And Small-scale Bioprocessing market?\nThe rapid growth of the biopharmaceutical industry and the continuous evolution of technology are the main drivers behind the large and small bioprocessing market growth, which in turn has contributed significantly to the effective demand and supply of the biopharmaceuticals. The big rise in the use of biologics like monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, biosimilars, and cell and gene therapies has created a strong need for effective and large-scale bioprocessing solutions for both development and commercial production.\n\nThe U.S. biomanufacturing initiatives are crucial for expanding the bioprocessing market because they drive demand for small-scale bioprocessing systems used in process optimization, pilot production, and clinical trials based on the commercialization of successful biologics. Conversely, the commercialization of successful biologics drives the development of large-scale bioprocessing facilities.\nMoreover, the bottlenecks caused by the introduction of new agreements are smoothed out through superior innovation and desirably less contamination risks and shorter time-to-market periods. Concurrently with these advancements, there are the positive regulatory environments, government funding, and support for domestic biomanufacturing that are the main driving forces of the global infrastructure expansion. The shift toward personalized medicine has also been the increasing focus, which combined with the expansion of contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and growing biopharmaceutical activity in the emerging regions, is a key factor that supports the continuous growing of the large and small-scale bioprocessing market and thus makes it a central factor together with others, in the uninterrupted growth of the market.\n\n(A free sample of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing report is available upon request; please contact us for more information.)\nOur Free Sample Report Consists of the following:\nThe updated report for 2026 includes an introduction, an overview, and an in-depth industry analysis.\nProvide detailed chapter-by-chapter guidance on the Request.\nUpdated Regional Analysis with a Graphical Representation of Size, Share, and Trends for the Year 2026\nIncludes Tables and figures that have been updated.\nThe most recent version of the report includes the Top Market Players, their Business Strategies, Sales Volume, and Revenue Analysis\nCustom Market Insights (CMI) research methodology\n(Please note that the sample of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing report has been modified to include the COVID-19 impact study prior to delivery.)\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of the Large And Small Scale Bioprocessing Market Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/large-and-small-scale-bioprocessing-market/\nSegment Insight\nBy Product Type\nThe bioreactors/fermenters segment is expected to hold the largest market share in 2025.

Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1-800-715-9871 and using conference ID 5908687. The call will also be webcast and can be accessed at the Astera Labs website at https://ir.asteralabs.com/ . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay on the company’s website for the next six months.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those concerning our financial outlook, to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP measure can be found later in this release. The timing and impact of any adjustments to arrive at the corresponding GAAP financial measures concerning our financial outlook are inherently dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or that may be outside of our control. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP pro forma diluted earnings per share, and non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average share count. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP pro forma diluted earnings per share, and non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average share count provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nWe adjust the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense\nWe exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate non-cash stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. Moreover, stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash charge that can vary significantly from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance, and therefore excluding this item provides investors and other users of our financial information with information that allows meaningful comparisons of our business performance across periods.\n\nAcquisition-related costs\nWe exclude acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions, which we generally would have not otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. Acquisition-related costs include certain incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination such as third-party costs: advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional fees. We believe that providing the non-GAAP measures excluding these costs assists our investors because such costs are not reflective of our ongoing operating results.\nEmployer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation resulting from our IPO\nWe exclude employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and net settlement of restricted stock units in connection with our initial public offering (the “IPO”), because this does not correlate to the operation of our business. We believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance given the amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions was immaterial prior to our IPO.\n\nIncome tax effect\nThis represents the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis and one-off discrete tax adjustments that are unrelated to our core operating performance in connection with the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. This approach is designed to enhance investors’ ability to understand the impact of our non-GAAP tax expense on our current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments.\nNon-GAAP pro forma weighted-average shares to compute non-GAAP pro forma net income per share\nWe present non-GAAP pro forma weighted-average shares, assuming our redeemable convertible preferred stock is converted from the beginning of each respective periods presented, to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding EPS trend on a consistent basis. All of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock converted into the equivalent number of shares of common stock in connection with our IPO.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on Astera Labs' current expectations. The words “accelerating,” “advance,” “aims,” “anticipate,” “beginning,” “believe,\" “confidence,” “committed,” “continue,” “could,” “deliver,” “designed,” “drive,” “enable,” “estimate,\" “expand,” “expect,\" “forecasting,” “forthcoming,” “forward,” “future,” “goal,” “growth,” “guidance,” “intend,\" “look,” “may,” “momentum,” “on track,” “opportunities,” “outlook,” “paths,” “plan,” “poised,” “positioning,” “progress,” “proliferate,” “proposed,” “prospects,” “provide,” “represents,” “roadmaps,” “should,” “strategies,” “target,” “trends,” “upside,” “ultimately,” “vision,” “will,” and similar phrases as they relate to Astera Labs are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor(s) may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on any of the forward-looking statements.

      "Content": "Entegris Q4 Earnings Call Highlights\n\nMarketBeat\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 12:49 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ENTG\n\nKey Points Entegris beat or hit guidance in Q4 with sales of $824 million (down 3% y/y, up 2% sequentially), a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7% , and non‑GAAP EPS of $0.70 , while full‑year unit‑driven revenue rose about 2% and CapEx‑driven revenue fell ~ 7% .\nFree cash flow improved to $404 million (a 12.7% FCF margin) in 2025, CapEx was $299 million and is expected to decline to ~ $250 million in 2026, while net debt ended Q4 around $3.4 billion with net leverage at 3.8x and a target to get below 3.5x by end‑2026.\nManagement sees a more constructive 2026 backed by mid‑single‑digit industry MSI growth, > 20% NAND bit growth and node transitions (including 2nm) that should raise content per wafer, alongside POR wins at advanced nodes and a push to increase local‑for‑local Asia supply for China.\nInterested in Entegris, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nIndustrial Tech Crossovers: When Manufacturing Meets Innovation\nEntegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) reported fourth-quarter 2025 results that came in at the high end or above its guidance ranges, as management emphasized disciplined execution and early signs of a more constructive semiconductor backdrop heading into 2026.\nChief Executive Officer Dave Reeder said fourth-quarter revenue, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP EPS all landed at the high end or above guidance. For the full year, he said total revenue was approximately flat versus 2024 excluding divestitures, with “unit-driven” revenue up about 2% in 2025 and “CapEx-driven” revenue down 7% in line with reduced industry fab construction spending.\nFourth-quarter results and segment performance → 3 ETFs Designed to Survive the Next Market Crash\n5 Trends You Need to Know This Quarter\nChief Financial Officer Linda LaGorga said fourth-quarter sales were $824 million , down 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. GAAP gross margin was 43.8% , and non-GAAP gross margin was 44% , with the sequential improvement driven primarily by increased production volumes.\nLaGorga reported GAAP operating expenses of $256 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $188 million . Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7% of revenue, above guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70 , which she said was above guidance.\n\n→ 3 Consumer Staples Stocks Breaking Out This Month\nChip Gear Maker Entegris Has Potential, But Is It Buyable Now?\nBy segment, LaGorga outlined:\nMaterial Solutions (MS): Q4 sales of $362 million , flat year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Sequential growth was driven primarily by advanced deposition materials, supported by demand for molybdenum (moly) deposition within NAND. Adjusted operating margin was 20.9% .\nAdvanced Purity Solutions (APS): Q4 sales of $465 million , down 5% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by fluid handling and FOUPs, partially offset by liquid filtration, which delivered “another record quarter.” Adjusted operating margin was 24.8% .\n\nStory Continues\nCash flow, leverage, and capital spending For 2025, LaGorga said free cash flow was $404 million , representing a 12.7% free cash flow margin, nearly a 300 basis point improvement year over year. She attributed the improvement to working capital execution, including accounts receivable and reduced year-over-year inventory growth.\n→ 2 Subscription Economy Winners That Still Dominate Their Niches\nCapital expenditures in 2025 were $299 million , about 9% of sales. Reeder added that Entegris has completed a multi-year manufacturing CapEx investment cycle that began in 2022 and expects 2026 CapEx to decline to $250 million , with longer-term CapEx returning to approximately 7% to 8% of sales.\n\nOn the balance sheet, LaGorga said Entegris paid down $150 million of term loan debt in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Gross debt ended the quarter at about $3.7 billion , with net debt of $3.4 billion . Net leverage ended 2025 at 3.8x , and management reiterated a target to reduce net leverage to below 3.5x by the end of 2026.\n2026 demand outlook: node transitions, MSI growth, and CapEx variability Reeder said the industry backdrop “appears more constructive” in 2026 and highlighted multiple areas that could support improvement versus 2025, including logic and memory node transitions, stronger industry MSI (wafer starts) growth, and a recovery in fab construction spending.\nManagement expects mid-single-digit industry MSI growth in 2026 and noted that about 75% of Entegris revenue is unit-driven and correlated to MSI. Reeder said advanced logic utilization is already near 100%, and he expects demand for 2-nanometer devices to meaningfully increase wafer output through 2026, benefiting Entegris through higher content per wafer and the company’s share positions at advanced nodes.\n\nIn memory, Reeder described NAND transitions from “low 250 layers” to about 300 layers and said next-generation DRAM and HBM products are expected to roll out in 2026. He said NAND bit growth is expected to exceed 20% in 2026, driven more by higher layer count than a major increase in MSI, and he expects a double-digit increase in NAND content per wafer tied to higher layer nodes and new materials such as moly and selective etch.\nFor CapEx-driven exposure, management said 25% of company revenue is tied to industry CapEx, with roughly two-thirds of that correlated to fab construction and one-third to wafer fab equipment (WFE). Reeder said fab construction spending is expected to grow modestly in 2026 after a high single-digit decline in 2025, while WFE is expected to deliver strong growth. He cautioned during Q&A that the timing of fab construction-related demand has been moving “pretty significantly month to month,” and he characterized the fab CapEx portion as a “wild card,” potentially more second-half weighted.\n\nOperational priorities: POR wins, footprint actions, and local-for-local manufacturing Reeder updated investors on four CEO priorities he first discussed last quarter:\nDeepening customer intimacy and securing positions of record (PORs): He said Entegris has secured strong POR positions at the most advanced logic nodes across product lines including CMP consumables, advanced deposition and implant materials, liquid purification/filtration, and wafer handling. He also cited traction in advanced memory (DRAM/HBM) and POR wins in next-generation NAND across deposition materials, CMP, and selective etch applications.\nImproving utilization and rationalizing the footprint: Reeder said the Taiwan facility continues to ramp, and the Colorado facility is expected to substantially complete key customer product qualifications in 2026. He also said Entegris exited its Chester, Pennsylvania facility in the fourth quarter and expects to rationalize at least one additional facility in the first half of 2026.\nImproving free cash flow: Reeder said free cash flow margin improved to 12.7% in 2025, in line with the company’s target, and that free cash flow is now incorporated into short- and long-term incentive plans.\nIncreasing local-for-local manufacturing (especially for China): Reeder said the company expects about 85% of China revenue in the first quarter to be supplied by Asia facilities, with the proportion increasing through 2026.\n\nOn China, management said China remained about 21% of sales in both 2024 and 2025, with dollars down slightly. Reeder said the company’s main obstacle in China is assuring supply, and he expects continued progress in qualifying more Asia-based manufacturing to support that market.\nReeder also said Entegris is rescheduling its Capital Markets Day from May to the fall due to the CFO transition, and he thanked LaGorga for her contributions.\nFirst-quarter outlook and near-term margin commentary For the first quarter, LaGorga guided sales of $785 million to $825 million , reflecting about a 4% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Gross margin is expected to be 44.5% to 45.5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including about 100 basis points of benefit in Q1 from a change related to the useful lives of assets.\nShe guided EBITDA margin of 26.5% to 27.5% , GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.51 , and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.78 . For Q2, management expects sales to increase 1% to 3% sequentially from Q1, in line with normal seasonality.\n\nIn Q&A, management said gross margin has stabilized around the current range, with volume leverage, the Taiwan ramp, and facility rationalizations expected to support improvement as production increases.\nAbout Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) Entegris, Inc is a leading provider of advanced materials and process control solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries.

Shares of semiconductor materials supplier Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) jumped 10.2% in the afternoon session after the company reported fourth-quarter results that beat analyst expectations and provided a strong forecast for the first quarter of 2026.\nThe advanced materials supplier posted adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share on revenue of $823.9 million, surpassing consensus estimates. While these results were positive compared to forecasts, they represented a decline from the same period in the previous year when the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share. However, the key driver for the stock's rise appeared to be the company's upbeat outlook. For the first quarter of 2026, Entegris forecasted revenue between $785 million and $825 million, with adjusted earnings per share ranging from $0.70 to $0.78. This guidance was comfortably above analyst expectations, suggesting stronger performance ahead and boosting investor confidence.\n\nIs now the time to buy Entegris?

But moves this big are rare even for Entegris and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock gained 11.9% on the news that UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded the stock from a \"Neutral\" to a \"Buy\" rating and significantly raised the price target. The price target saw a substantial increase to $145.00 from $90.00, reflecting strong confidence in the company's future. Adding to the bullish sentiment, KeyBanc also lifted its price target on the shares to $111 from $107. This wave of positive analyst ratings followed Entegris's announcement that its board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, which supported investor confidence in the company's financial health.\nEntegris is up 49.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $133.91 per share, has set a new 52-week high.

Shares of analog chips maker onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) jumped 3.1% in the afternoon session after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results where earnings per share beat analyst estimates, but revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter fell short. The analog chip maker posted an adjusted EPS of $0.64, beating the consensus estimate of $0.62. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, in line with expectations but representing an 11.2% decline from the previous year. However, the positive earnings surprise was tempered by the company's forecast for the first quarter, which projected both revenue and earnings below Wall Street's projections. Despite the weak outlook, investors appeared to focus on the better-than-expected profit and a strong free cash flow margin of 31.7% for the quarter. The stock's rally represented a significant reversal from an initial 4.6% drop immediately following the earnings release, suggesting a shift in sentiment as the market digested the full report.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $66.82, up 1.7% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy onsemi? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us onsemi’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 18 days ago when the stock dropped 2.7% on the news that Intel reported disappointing earnings report and weak forecast for the current quarter. Shares of the chipmaker plunged about 12% after it posted a fourth-quarter loss and provided a softer-than-expected outlook. The company's first-quarter revenue projections of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion fell short of analyst consensus. More concerning for the broader sector, Intel executives flagged industry-wide supply shortages as a significant problem that could persist into 2026, with supply capabilities expected to be at their lowest point in the first quarter. When a market leader like Intel signals such widespread issues, it often creates a ripple effect, raising investor concerns about the health and near-term prospects of the entire semiconductor industry.\nonsemi is up 17.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $66.82 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of onsemi’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,674.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

To own KLA, you need to be comfortable tying your fortunes to wafer fab equipment spending and, increasingly, AI-driven capacity investments. The latest quarter’s higher revenue and earnings, coupled with Q3 guidance, reinforce that near term demand remains intact for now, even if that may not materially change the existing catalysts around AI-related tool orders and the broader semiconductor capex cycle. The affirmed US$1.90 dividend and completion of a US$9.06 billion buyback fit neatly into KLA’s pattern of returning substantial cash, but they do not remove the key risks: potential swings in wafer fab budgets, high valuation multiples versus “fair” estimates, and reliance on a few large chip manufacturers. Instead, this news mainly strengthens the sense that management is leaning into the current industry upturn.\n\nHowever, investors should also be aware of how quickly wafer fab spending plans can reset. KLA's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? Uncover how much higher they are than fair value .\nExploring Other Perspectives The three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$758 to US$1,297 per share, showing how far apart private investors can be.

Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here.\n\nStory Continues\nSustainability of growing 3-6% faster than the underlying market Management stated that outperformance is typically highest during node transitions which drive content per wafer; they feel the setup is constructive for a return to these levels.\nThe timing of these transitions and the volatility of fab CapEx remain the primary variables for the exact magnitude of outperformance in 2026.\nCompetitive dynamics and supply assurance in the China market The primary competitive hurdle in China is guaranteeing supply; Entegris is addressing this by shifting 85-90% of production for China to Asian facilities.\nManagement noted that when supply is assured, Chinese customers prioritize yield and performance, where Entegris maintains a competitive advantage.\nNAND market inflection and layer count vs. wafer starts While NAND pricing has firmed, incremental wafer starts remain 'measured' as producers focus on node migrations to higher layer counts.\nEntegris is relatively indifferent between layer count growth and wafer growth, though full wafer starts provide slightly more total benefit.\nOne stock.

      "Content": "ON Semiconductor sees drop in sales in Q4 as earnings top estimates\n\nProactive\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:16 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ON\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, as revenue was in line with estimates but down from the same period a year earlier.\nThe semiconductor firm posted Q4 revenue of $1.53 billion, in line with analyst expectations.\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at $0.64, exceeding expectations of $0.62.\n\nFor the full year, the company generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, achieving a record high free cash flow margin of 24%, which was returned to shareholders through share repurchases.\n“We remained disciplined in our execution and met expectations in the fourth quarter as we saw increasing signs of stabilization in our key markets,” ON Semiconductor CEO Hassane El-Khoury said. “We continue to invest in intelligent power and sensing technologies that position us to win in the most critical technology transitions shaping our industry.”\nLooking ahead, the company expects first-quarter 2026 revenue of $1.49 billion at the midpoint, slightly below analyst projections of $1.51 billion. Adjusted EPS guidance for the quarter is $0.47 at the midpoint, under analysts’ estimate of $0.61.\n\nJefferies analysts maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on ON Semiconductor with a $73 price target, noting that growth in AI Data Centers is helping offset headwinds from non-core business exits and some industrial lumpiness.\nThe analysts noted that AI data center revenue is on a run-rate exceeding $400 million in Q1, while aggregate exits of roughly $300 million are expected across the March, June, and September quarters.\nThey highlighted modest improvement in auto and a target of over 40% gross margin by Q4, though they remain cautious on broader analog recovery trends.\n“Overall, the outlook is largely unchanged despite the moving pieces,” the firm wrote.\nShares of ON Semiconductor added 4.3% on the results, trading at about $68.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Marvell Technology (MRVL) Fairly Priced After Recent Share Price Weakness?\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 9:12 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nIf you are trying to figure out whether Marvell Technology is attractively priced or not, this article will walk you through how its current share price stacks up against different measures of value.\nThe stock last closed at US$82.35, with returns of 4.7% over the past week, a 1.0% decline over the past month, a 7.9% decline year to date, a 26.8% decline over the past year, a 56.1% gain over five years, and an 82.6% gain over three years.\nRecent coverage around Marvell has focused on its position in semiconductors and investor interest in how it fits into broader technology themes. This helps frame why the share price has been moving. This context matters because sentiment, expectations, and sector focus can all affect what investors are willing to pay for the stock at any given time.\nOn our valuation checks, Marvell scores 5 out of 6 for being considered undervalued, as shown in our valuation score . Next, we will look at the usual valuation approaches before finishing with a way to assess value that brings these methods together in a more complete picture.\n\nFind out why Marvell Technology's -26.8% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Marvell Technology Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model takes the cash Marvell Technology is expected to generate in the future, then discounts those projections back to today to estimate what the business might be worth in dollars right now.\nMarvell currently has trailing twelve month free cash flow of about $1.50b. Using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, analysts and extrapolated estimates project free cash flow reaching about $6.38b in 2031. Simply Wall St provides ten year projections, combining analyst inputs for earlier years with extrapolated figures in later years based on those inputs.\n\nPutting those cash flows together and discounting them back to today gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $83.26 per share, compared with the recent share price of $82.35. That implies the stock is roughly 1.1% below this DCF estimate, which sits within a fairly tight band around the current market price.\nResult: ABOUT RIGHT\nMarvell Technology is fairly valued according to our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) , but this can change at a moment's notice. Track the value in your watchlist or portfolio and be alerted on when to act.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Marvell Technology.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Marvell Technology Price vs Earnings For a profitable company like Marvell Technology, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of earnings. Investors typically accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see lower risk, and prefer a lower P/E when growth expectations are more modest or risks feel higher.\nMarvell currently trades on a P/E of 29.0x. The broader Semiconductor industry average is about 44.2x, and the peer group average provided is 79.2x, so the stock is priced below both of those reference points. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 42.5x, which is the P/E level it would expect for Marvell given factors such as its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.\n\nThis Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it adjusts for company specific traits rather than assuming one size fits all. With Marvell’s current P/E of 29.0x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 42.5x, this framework suggests the shares are trading at a discount to what might be considered a more company specific fair value range.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

Discover our 22 top founder-led companies .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Marvell Technology Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These are simple stories you create about Marvell Technology that tie your own assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins into a financial forecast, connect that forecast to a Fair Value, sit inside the Community page on Simply Wall St where millions of investors share their views, update automatically as fresh news or earnings arrive, and can differ widely. For example, one investor might have a more optimistic view that lines up with a Fair Value of about US$148 per share, while another might have a more cautious view closer to US$90. This helps you compare those Fair Values with today’s share price to decide whether you see the stock as closer to a buy, hold, or sell in your own framework.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Marvell Technology?

Let’s discuss the fundamentals in detail.\nAMAT Gains From Traction Across Its Portfolio AMAT specializes in Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Recent launches like Xtera epi, Kinex hybrid bonding, and PROVision 10 eBeam will add to AMAT’s growth story.\nAMAT expects next-generation technologies to be produced in large volume, which means that the company’s customers will be ramping up their foundries, naturally benefiting AMAT’s business. In 2025, AMAT strengthened its leadership in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50%. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\n\nAMAT expects its leading-edge foundry, logic, dynamic random access memory and high bandwidth memory to be the fastest-growing wafer fabrication equipment businesses in 2026. AMAT’s advanced packaging business, which is currently valued at $1.5 billion, is still on track to double to $3 billion over the next few years, driven by HBM demand and next-generation packaging architectures.\nThese factors will contribute to increased traction in Applied Materials’ wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), driven by growing usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\nAMAT restructured its pricing program, and it is expected to contribute most of the 120-bps gross margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. This cost restructuring will further provide AMAT with enough headroom to ramp up its R&D investments. AMAT is setting up the Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization center for research, which is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nAMAT Navigates Competitive Challenges Applied Materials is winning over its competition like KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and ASML Holding ASML in the semiconductor supply chain market.\nLam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although they develop solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holdings develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions like Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in GAA transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nWith these factors in place, AMAT’s long-term growth outlook remains strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 revenues are expected to rise 13.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2027 earnings is expected to grow 22% year over year. AMAT's fiscal 2027 earnings estimates have been revised upward in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Buy AMAT Stock for Now The continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging, driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing, is a tailwind for AMAT stock.

Let's see what that is -- and what investors should do.\n\nAI powers results, but smartphone risk emerges After an initial dip following its results, Arm shares rallied as investors turned their focus more toward its AI opportunities than worries about smartphones. Arm said it sees its data center business becoming its largest segment in the coming year, and that it will reach a 50% market share among top hyperscalers. This growth is being led by the shift toward inference and AI agents, which it says makes central processing units (CPUs) more important within the data center.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?

See the stocks »\n\nHowever, the company did admit that increasing memory supply constraints could put a dent in smartphone sales, with talk of a potential 15% reduction in volumes over the next year. That said, it noted that even a 20% reduction would only equate to a 2% to 4% effect on its smartphone royalties. However, this company is trading at a growth multiple, so that is a big potential risk.\nOverall, Arm's fiscal third-quarter revenue jumped 26% year over year to $1.24 billion. License revenue rose by 25% year over year to $505 million. Its agreement with Softbank contributed $200 million to that total. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by two, to 50. Over half of its top 30 customers use this license. It also added six Arm Flexible Access customers, bringing the total to 318.\n\nRoyalty revenue, meanwhile, rose 27% year over year to $737 million. The growth was driven by increased adoption of newer ARM technology, including Armv9 architecture and Arm CSS (compute subsystems), which carry higher royalty rates. It said five customers are now shipping devices with CSS chips, including the top four Android phone makers.\nAnnualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, soared 28% to $1.62 billion. Looking ahead, Arm guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to come in around $1.47 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%. Royalty growth is projected to be up by the low teens and licensing by the high teens. It forecasts that adjusted earnings per share will be between $0.54 and 0.62.\n\nStory Continues\nIs ARM's stock a buy? Arm's licensing and royalty business model is attractive given its high gross margin and recurring nature, and the company has an opportunity to continue to grow nicely in the data center space. Meanwhile, its ties to Softbank provide a steady stream of growth.\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 49 based on analysts' fiscal 2027 consensus, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.7 (with below 1 considered undervalued), ARM looks reasonably priced. However, the likely weakness in the smartphone market next year isn't necessarily embedded in those estimates, and as such, this would keep me on the sidelines for now.\n\nShould you buy stock in Arm Holdings right now?

      "Content": "NVTS Trades at Premium Valuation: Should You Hold or Fold the Stock?\n\nOm Jaiswal\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 7:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVTS\n\nLRCX\n\nFORM\n\nAMAT\n\nNavitas Semiconductor NVTS is currently trading at a high price-to-sales (P/S) multiple compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Navitas Semiconductor’s forward 12-month P/S ratio sits at 49.54X, significantly higher than the industry’s forward 12-month P/S ratio of 8.26X. The Zacks Value Score of F also suggests that NVTS stock is overvalued.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor stock trades at a higher P/S multiple compared with other industry peers, including Lam Research LRCX, Applied Materials AMAT and FormFactor FORM. At present, Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have P/S multiples of 11.58X, 8.46X and 7.69X, respectively.\nNVTS Forward 12-Month P/S Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNavitas Semiconductor’s elevated valuation raises concerns about whether the stock can justify such lofty multiples. Considering the premium valuation, investors must be wondering whether they should buy, hold or sell the stock, especially amid near-term challenges.\n\nMobile Business Exit to Hurt NVTS' Near-Term Prospects Navitas Semiconductor has decided to walk away from its low-margin mobile products to focus its resources on high-power business. This strategic decision is hurting the company’s top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2025, NVTS’s revenues decreased 53.4% year over year to $10.1 million, reflecting adverse impacts from its strategic decision to deprioritize its lower-margin China mobile business.\nThe company projects a further decline in its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2025. Navitas Semiconductor expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenues to be $7 million (+/- $0.25 million), down significantly on a sequential basis as the company is pruning its low-margin mobile business to align its resources toward high-power business.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s decision to prune its mobile business seems to have weighed on investors’ sentiments, as reflected by a decline in NVTS’ share price over the past three months. NVTS stock has plunged 11% over the past month, underperforming the industry’s decline of 2.7%.\nThe stock has underperformed its industry peers, including Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor. Shares of Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have returned 3.8%, 7.6% and 31%, respectively.\n1-Month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, for investors, not everything is gloom and doom.\nRising Demand in Data Centers Boosts NVTS’ Prospects Navitas Semiconductor is shifting its focus toward high-power markets, such as AI data centers, performance computing, energy and grid infrastructure, and industrial electrification. This strategic move aligns with the company’s “Navitas 2.0” strategy, under which the company is reallocating resources toward high-power markets, pruning lower-margin mobile business, and working more closely with hyperscalers, graphics processing unit vendors and system OEMs.\n\nStory Continues\nNavitas Semiconductor’s inclusion in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt AI factory ecosystem is an important step. The new architecture shifts data center power distribution from traditional AC/DC stages to a high-voltage DC approach that requires faster, more efficient power electronics. This creates an opening for Navitas Semiconductor’s gallium nitride (GaN) and high-voltage silicon carbide (SiC) technologies, both of which are now part of the NVIDIA-led ecosystem.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Navitas Semiconductor highlighted that it is one of the few companies offering both GaN and SiC solutions across the full power path from the grid to the graphics processing unit. The company has begun sampling mid-voltage GaN devices at 100 volts, which target the last stage of power conversion inside AI servers. It is also sampling 2.3 kV and 3.3 kV SiC modules for grid and energy storage applications that support these new data center designs.\nNVTS expects 2026 to be a transition year, with small but growing shipments tied to traditional server power supplies. The larger opportunity depends on how fast hyperscalers adopt the 800-volt architecture and will depend on Navitas Semiconductor's ability to secure multi-generation design wins.\n\nNVTS to Benefit From Strategic Partnerships Navitas Semiconductor is strengthening its position in high-power markets through strategic partnerships. In mid-December, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its distribution relationship with Avnet, making the latter a globally franchised distribution partner. Under the deal, Avnet will provide technical and commercial support for NVTS’ GaN and SiC products across regions.\nIn early December, NVTS entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Cyient Semiconductors to accelerate GaN adoption in India. The two companies plan to co-develop GaN products, system modules and design platforms aimed at high-voltage, high-power markets, such as AI data centers, electric mobility and grid infrastructure.\n\nIn late November, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its partnership with WT Microelectronics in Asia. NVTS is consolidating its distributor base, and WT Microelectronics will take the lead for customer engagement and logistics in Asia, per the partnership agreement. This collaboration is meant to improve support for high-power customers in the region.\nIn mid-November, Navitas Semiconductor announced a long-term partnership with GlobalFoundries. Under this collaboration, the two companies will develop and manufacture next-generation GaN power devices at Global Foundries’ Vermont facility, with development planned for early 2026 and production expected later that year.\nThese partnerships bode well for the company's prospects as Navitas Semiconductor is trying to prepare for future demand. Through these strategic partnerships, NVTS aims to strengthen its supply chain, improve customer access, and prepare for large future opportunities, once high-power markets begin to scale in 2026 and 2027.\n\nKey Technical Indicator Signals Bullish Trend for NVTS NVTS shares are trading above their 50-day & 200-day moving averages, a bullish technical signal that indicates the potential for continued upward momentum in the near term.\nNVTS 50-Day & 200-day Simple Moving Average\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion: Hold Navitas Semiconductor Stock Right Now Navitas Semiconductor is in a good position to benefit from the fast growth of AI data centers and is making steady progress through its strategic partnerships, which bode well for the company’s prospects and support its long-term growth plans. The company’s GaN and high-voltage SiC products now play a role in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt power setup, which shows that the technology is relevant and in demand.\nHowever, Navitas Semiconductor’s premium valuation warrants a cautious approach to the stock.\nNavitas Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

To own Entegris, you really have to believe in the long-term need for its specialty materials across semiconductor manufacturing, while accepting some near-term earnings bumpiness. The latest Q4 2025 numbers showed slightly softer full-year profit, and the new Q1 2026 guidance, while still pointing to solid revenue of about US$785 million to US$825 million, fell short of prior expectations and refocused attention on margins and demand timing. That feels particularly important with the shares having climbed strongly in recent months and already trading on a richer earnings multiple than many peers. On top of that, the upcoming CFO transition introduces another moving part just as the company works through a softer patch.

LITE expects robust momentum to continue, with revenues anticipated at $780-830 million for the fiscal third-quarter. Operating margin is projected to expand further to 30-31%, while EPS is expected at $2.15-2.35. This outlook represents meaningful acceleration, which reflects intensifying AI infrastructure investments by hyperscale operators, successful capacity expansion initiatives and the company's broadening product portfolio across optical circuit switches, co-packaged optics and cloud transceivers.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter EPS is pegged at $2.24, up by 47.4% over the past 30 days. The figure indicates 292.98% growth year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nLumentum Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus Lumentum Holdings Inc. price-consensus-chart | Lumentum Holdings Inc. Quote\nLITE Benefits From Strong Product Portfolio Across AI Infrastructure LITE has become a key technology provider for AI networks, benefiting from the shift toward optical connectivity solutions. Traditional electrical switches struggle with the bandwidth and power needs of AI training clusters, driving demand for Optical Circuit Switches (OCS). OCS technology allows hyperscale operators to dynamically reconfigure network setups and optimize resources based on changing workload demands. The OCS business has emerged as a major growth driver, with fiscal second-quarter revenue surpassing $10 million three months earlier than expected. The order backlog has jumped past $400 million, positioning LITE to exit 2026 at a quarterly OCS run rate well above the earlier $100 million target.\n\nCo-packaged optics (CPO) and cloud transceivers represent additional growth opportunities reshaping data center connectivity. CPO integrates optical connections directly into processor packages, cutting power use and boosting performance as AI systems become more densely packed. LITE has secured a multi-hundred-million-dollar purchase order for ultra-high-power lasers supporting CPO applications, with deliveries expected in the first half of 2027. The transceiver business has rebounded strongly, with fiscal second-quarter revenue exceeding previous levels as customers shift to 1.6-terabit speeds. LITE competes effectively with Broadcom, Marvell Technology and Coherent Corp. across these segments, with higher-speed products commanding better prices and manufacturing improvements strengthening profit margins.\n\nLITE's Valuation Reflects Premium Growth Profile LITE is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales of 10.28x, above the sub-industry average of 5.23x and sector average of 6.49x. Among peers, Broadcom commands 15.42x, while Coherent Corp. trades at 5.85x and Marvell Technology at 6.9x. The premium valuation appears justified given the company's exceptional fundamentals, including revenue growth exceeding 85% year over year, operating margins expanding toward 30% and diversified revenue streams across optical circuit switches, co-packaged optics and cloud transceivers.\n\nLITE’s P/S Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion LITE demonstrates exceptional execution with strong fiscal second-quarter performance and substantially increased forward guidance. The company's diversified portfolio across optical circuit switches, co-packaged optics and cloud transceivers, backed by an order backlog exceeding $400 million, provides strong revenue visibility into 2027. The early mover advantage in OCS and technology leadership position LITE favorably against peers.

ONTO and Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT. At present, KLA Corporation, Onto Innovation and Applied Materials have a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 34.16, 33.78 and 31.60, respectively.\n\nLam Research Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLRCX’s lofty valuation multiple is a result of robust appreciation in its share price. In the trailing 12 months, Lam Research shares have soared 174.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 35.1%. It has also outpaced the returns of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation. Shares of KLA Corporation, Applied Materials and Onto Innovation have rallied 90%, 80.4% and 21.6%, respectively.\n\nLam Research One-Year Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlthough it seems investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock, the billion-dollar question is: Is it justified to overpay?\nIn our opinion, Lam Research’s strong growth prospects amid artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for advanced nodes justify this premium valuation. The company’s high growth potential in AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets, along with back-to-back quarters of strong financial performance, suggest that LRCX stock’s upward momentum is far from over.\n\nLam Research’s Resilient Financial Performance Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical issues, and trade and tariff wars, LRCX’s financials remain impressive. In the company’s last reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, total revenues rose 22% year over year to $5.34 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily driven by continued demand across the Systems and Customer Support Business Group segments.\nLam Research reported second-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.27 per share, which beat the consensus mark by 8.5%. The bottom line also increased 39.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation Quote\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the second quarter, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 34.3%, up 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which is impressive, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s second-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability.\n\nAI-Driven Chip Demand: The Key Catalyst for LRCX’s Growth Lam Research is capitalizing on AI trends. It builds the tools chipmakers need to manufacture next-generation semiconductors, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and chips used in advanced packaging. These technologies are vital for powering AI and cloud data centers.\nLam Research’s products are not only critical but also innovative. For example, its ALTUS ALD tool uses molybdenum to improve speed and efficiency in chip production. Another product, the Aether platform, helps chipmakers achieve higher performance and density. These are essential capabilities as demand for advanced AI chips continues to increase.\n\nIn 2025, Lam Research’s revenues from advanced packaging grew significantly, and management anticipates strong 40% year-over-year growth for 2026. The industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents growth opportunities for LRCX’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.\nThese trends are aiding Lam Research’s financial performance. The company has demonstrated consistent execution, maintaining quarterly revenues of more than $5 billion for the past three consecutive quarters, reflecting solid demand from leading chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung.\nWith AI-driven investments accelerating, Lam Research’s leading position in etch and deposition makes it a key beneficiary of the ongoing semiconductor spending cycle. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 19.5% and 21.2%, respectively.

      "Content": "Texas Instruments (TXN) Reliance on International Sales: What Investors Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TXN\n\nHave you evaluated the performance of Texas Instruments' (TXN) international operations for the quarter ending December 2025? Given the extensive global presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nWhile analyzing TXN's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.42 billion, showing rise of 10.4%. We will now explore the breakdown of TXN's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\nA Dive into TXN's International Revenue Trends During the quarter, Japan contributed $290 million in revenue, making up 6.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $297.43 million, this meant a surprise of -2.5%. Looking back, Japan contributed $313 million, or 6.6%, in the previous quarter, and $277 million, or 6.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nRest of World generated $98 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 2.2% of the total. This represented a surprise of +26.34% compared to the $77.57 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of World accounted for $74 million (1.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $69 million (1.7%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $948 million came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 21.4%. This represented a surprise of +3.13% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $919.21 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $972 million, or 20.5%, and $786 million, or 19.6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nRest of Asia accounted for 10.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $457 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.19%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $476.96 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Rest of Asia contributed $505 million (10.7%) and $432 million (10.8%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nChina generated $951 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.9% compared to the $933.3 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, China accounted for $1.02 billion (21.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $821 million (20.5%) to the total revenue.\nInternational Market Revenue Projections Wall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments to report $4.51 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to contribute 6.5% (translating to $293.26 million), 1.7% ($77.37 million), 20.5% ($925.54 million), 10.5% ($473.62 million), and 20.7% ($933.44 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $19.36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 9.5% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to make up 6.4%, 1.7%, 20%, 10.3%, and 20.5% of this total, corresponding to $1.24 billion, $322.14 million, $3.86 billion, $2 billion, and $3.97 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Bottom Line Texas Instruments' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\nTexas Instruments, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term.

The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, of which Texas Instruments is a part, has declined 1.1% over the same period.

The company has rapidly built and expanded its growing, full-stack portfolio of silicon, software and tools that solve edge AI performance, power consumption and security challenges while simplifying implementation.\n“AI at the edge is no longer experimental—it’s expected, because of its many advantages over cloud implementations,” said Mark Reiten, corporate vice president of Microchip’s Edge AI business unit. “We created our Edge AI business unit to combine our MCUs, MPUs and FPGAs with optimized ML models plus model acceleration and robust development tools. Now, the addition of the first in our planned family of application solutions accelerates the design of secure and efficient intelligent systems that are ready to deploy in demanding markets.”\n\nMicrochip’s new full-stack application solutions for its MCUs and MPUs encompass pre-trained and deployable models as well as application code that can be modified, enhanced and applied to different environments. This can be done either through Microchip’s embedded software and ML development tools or those from Microchip partners. The new solutions include:\nDetection and classification of dangerous electrical arc faults using AI-based signal analysis\nCondition monitoring and equipment health assessment for predictive maintenance\nFacial recognition with liveness detection supporting secure, on-device identity verification\nKeyword spotting for consumer, industrial and automotive command-and-control interfaces\n\nStory Continues\nDevelopment Tools for AI at the Edge\nEngineers can leverage familiar Microchip development platforms to rapidly prototype and deploy AI models, reducing complexity and accelerating design cycles. The company’s MPLAB® X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with its MPLAB Harmony software framework and MPLAB ML Development Suite plug-in provides a unified and scalable approach for supporting embedded AI model integration through optimized libraries. Developers can, for example, start with simple proof-of-concept tasks on 8-bit MCUs and move them to production-ready high-performance applications on Microchip’s 16- or 32-bit MCUs.\n\nFor its FPGAs, Microchip’s VectorBlox™ Accelerator SDK 2.0 AI/ML inference platform accelerates vision, Human-Machine Interface (HMI), sensor analytics and other computationally intensive workloads at the edge while also enabling training, simulation and model optimization within a consistent workflow.\nOther support includes training and enablement tools like the company’s motor control reference design featuring its dsPIC® DSCs for data extraction in a real-time edge AI data pipeline, and others for load disaggregation in smart e-metering, object detection and counting, and motion surveillance. Microchip also helps solve edge AI challenges through complementary components that are required for product design and development. These include PCIe® devices that connect embedded compute at the edge and high-density power modules that enable edge AI in industrial automation and data center applications.\n\nThe analyst firm IoT Analytics stated in its October 2025 market report that embedding edge AI capabilities directly into MCUs is among the top four industry trends, enabling AI-driven applications “...that reduce latency, enhance data privacy, and lower dependency on cloud infrastructure.” Microchip’s AI initiative reinforces this trend with its MCU and MPU platform, as well as its FPGAs. Edge AI ecosystems increasingly require support for both software AI accelerators and integrated hardware acceleration on multiple devices across a range of memory configurations.\nAvailability\nMicrochip is actively working with customers of its full-stack application solutions, providing a variety of model training and other workflow support. The company is also working with multiple partners whose software provides developers with additional deployment-ready options.

      "Content": "2 Dividend Stocks That Are Off to Hot Starts to 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nTue, February 10, 2026 at 2:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: LMT\n\n^GSPC\n\nTXN\n\nThe S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nLockheed Martin Entering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\nTexas Instruments Another stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Lockheed Martin right now? Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nSTMicroelectronics introduces the first automotive microcontroller with AI acceleration for edge intelligence\n\nSTMicroelectronics International NV\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 11:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nSTMEF\n\nStellar P3E MCUs\nSTMicroelectronics introduces the first automotive microcontroller with AI acceleration for edge intelligence\nStellar P3E automotive microcontroller (MCU) enables real-time AI applications at the edge significantly enhancing vehicle intelligence\nSimplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units\nDelivers flexible, real-time performance for safe, responsive applications from hybrid/EV systems to body zonal architectures\n\nGeneva, February 10, 2026 -- STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) , a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, today announced the Stellar P3E , the first automotive microcontroller (MCU) with built-in AI acceleration for automotive edge intelligence. Designed for future software-defined vehicles, the Stellar P3E simplifies multi-function integration for X-in-1 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that reduce system cost, weight, and complexity.\n“Stellar P3E sets a new benchmark for automotive electrification by combining high-performance real-time control and edge AI in a single device that meets the highest automotive safety levels,” said Luca Rodeschini, Group Vice President and General Purpose and Automotive Microcontrollers Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics. “Its increased processing power, AI acceleration, large and extensible memory, rich analogue content, smart sensing capabilities, and intelligent power management functions support new applications such as virtual sensors. This better enables automakers with the tools to create safer, more efficient and more responsive driving experiences.”\n\nA defining feature of the Stellar P3E is its integrated ST Neural-ART Accelerator™ for real-time AI efficiency —making it the first MCU with an embedded neural network accelerator for the automotive industry. Powered by this dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) with an advanced data-flow architecture for AI workloads, and combined with its rich sensing capabilities, the P3E enables smart sensing that opens the door to new applications such as virtual sensors.\nThe P3E delivers inference processing at microsecond speeds, achieving up to 30x greater efficiency compared to traditional MCU core processors. This enables always-on, low-power artificial intelligence (AI) that can support real-time functions, including predictive maintenance and smart sensing, delivering significant benefits across a wide range of applications. For example, these capabilities can enhance charging speed and efficiency in electric vehicles and enable rapid deployment of new features, whether in the factory or in the field. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can introduce new functions and more intuitive behaviors through different AI models, reducing the need for additional sensors, modules, wiring, and integration effort.\n\nStory Continues\n“Shifting neural processing from centralized hubs to the edge of the vehicle enables sub millisecond-level decision-making, which is essential for the next generation of in-vehicle intelligence. Integrating AI hardware acceleration at the MCU level allows OEMs to deliver advanced capabilities, such as predictive maintenance for vehicle performance and smart sensing with virtual sensor applications. This enables very low latency sensing, actuation control, and other sophisticated features, without the cost and thermal burden of a full-scale SoC,” said Greg Basich, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research.\n\nAs the automotive industry embraces the shift toward software-defined vehicles (SDVs), Stellar P3E’s integrated xMemory, ST’s proprietary non-volatile memory based on phase-change memory (PCM) , provides the essential scalability and flexibility needed. Offering twice the density of traditional embedded flash memory and qualified for automotive environments, this extensible memory solution enables dynamic expansion of software storage to accommodate new features and updates without requiring any hardware redesign.\nThe P3E is fully supported within the ST Edge AI Suite , a comprehensive edge-AI ecosystem that spans from dataset creation to on-device deployment for data scientists and embedded engineers. As part of this suite, NanoEdge AI Studio tool is now available for the entire Stellar MCU family. In addition, the Stellar P3E is already integrated into Stellar Studio , ST’s all-in-one development environment tailored for automotive engineers. Together they reinforce a robust hardware and software ecosystem designed to streamline the deployment of sophisticated edge AI solutions in demanding automotive environments.\n\nThe start of production of the Stellar P3E is planned in the fourth quarter of 2026.\nKey technical highlights :\n500 MHz Arm® Cortex®-R52+ cores delivering the highest CoreMark score in its class - exceeding 8,000 points.\nSplit-lock architecture enabling designers to optimize the balance between functional safety and peak performance.\nOpen Arm architecture, leveraging a vast global developer community for accelerated innovation.\nRich I/O and analog capabilities support diverse functions, including advanced motor control for enhanced vehicle dynamics.\nAbout STMicroelectronics\nAt ST, we are 48,000 creators and makers of semiconductor technologies mastering the semiconductor supply chain with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. An integrated device manufacturer, we work with more than 200,000 customers and thousands of partners to design and build products, solutions, and ecosystems that address their challenges and opportunities, and the need to support a more sustainable world.

      "Content": "5 Revealing Analyst Questions From Skyworks Solutions’s Q4 Earnings Call\n\nKayode Omotosho\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 9:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SWKS\n\nSkyworks Solutions' fourth quarter results were marked by a combination of broad market momentum and stable mobile performance. Management pointed to ongoing growth in edge IoT, automotive, and data center segments, which collectively contributed to outperformance relative to Wall Street’s revenue and profit expectations. CEO Philip Brace attributed the quarter's results to robust execution in flagship mobile programs and expanding design wins in Wi-Fi 7 and automotive connectivity, while highlighting that smartphone replacement cycles are beginning to shorten. Management maintained a focus on disciplined investment and customer engagement amid industry-wide component pricing conversations.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow will the Qorvo acquisition benefit Skyworks?\n\nWhat drove Skyworks Solutions' Q4 revenue outperformance?\n\nWhat pricing pressures is Skyworks facing?\n\nWhat are Skyworks' main growth opportunities?\n\nIs now the time to buy SWKS? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.00 billion (3.1% year-on-year decline, 3.4% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $1.54 vs analyst estimates of $1.40 (10.1% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $325 million vs analyst estimates of $277.5 million (31.4% margin, 17.1% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $900 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $871.5 million\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.04 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.96\nOperating Margin: 10%, down from 16.9% in the same quarter last year\nInventory Days Outstanding: 115, up from 105 in the previous quarter\nMarket Capitalization: $9.26 billion\n\nWhile we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention.\nOur Top 5 Analyst Questions From Skyworks Solutions’s Q4 Earnings Call Harsh Kumar (Piper Sandler) asked about the specific technology and R&D benefits of the Qorvo deal. CEO Philip Brace highlighted complementary portfolios, particularly in RF technologies, and the potential to innovate across product categories.\nKarl Ackerman (BNP Paribas) questioned where broad market growth would be strongest and what would drive long-term expansion. Brace pointed to Wi-Fi adoption, automotive connectivity, and data center power/timing products as main growth areas.\nEdward Snyder (Charter Equity Research) probed on mobile content stability and mix impact. Brace explained that content gains could be moderated by model mix, making blended content per device flat, and noted ongoing strong demand.\nTimothy Arcuri (UBS) inquired about potential pricing pressure from the largest customer and repurchase activity. CFO Philip Carter said competitive pricing remains dynamic, but current demand is absorbing supply, and buybacks will be considered with financial prudence.\nPeter Peng (JPMorgan) asked about unit demand and seasonality in the mobile segment. Brace confirmed strong current demand and said seasonality remains normal, with no unusual patterns anticipated.\n\nStory Continues\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters In the coming quarters, the StockStory team will be watching (1) the pace of adoption and revenue contribution from Wi-Fi 7 and automotive connectivity, (2) execution on data center power and timing product launches, and (3) progress on integration planning and regulatory milestones for the Qorvo transaction. The company’s ability to manage mobile content stability and pricing dynamics will also be a key area of focus.\nSkyworks Solutions currently trades at $61.45, up from $55.93 just before the earnings.

Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Exlservice (+354% five-year return).

The way we live and work is also changing with AI, which is creating secular demand for more powerful chips.

Davidson分析師Gil Luria出具報告指出，我們認為市場過度反應，股價已經跌過頭。近幾個月來，OpenAI的商業模式已有顯著進步，「OpenAI似乎已經修正策略失誤，並重新聚焦於核心的前沿模型（frontier models），也開始考慮安插廣告的「變現」模式，「我們認為重整後的OpenAI可望重返Google最大挑戰者的位置」。CNBC報導，OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）上周五告知員工和投資人，ChatGPT的月成長率已重返逾10%。他並透露本周將推出升級版的AI聊天機器人模型。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n●Alphabet漲0.45%，收在324.32美元。據外媒報導，Google母公司Alphabet周一成功發行公司債籌資200億美元，規模超出原訂的150億美元。Alphabet此次發債吸引超過1000億美元認購，成為史上企業債發行需求最強勁的交易之一，顯示對於科技巨頭舉債發展AI，市場目前仍然樂意買單。分析師表示，這可能帶動今年企業債發行規模創下歷史新高。\n\n●Waters Corp周一崩跌13.94%，收在328.14美元，在醫療保健成分股中跌幅最大。該實驗室設備製造商第一季獲利預測不如市場預期，此外，投資人也關注去年收購的Becton Dickinson表現疲弱。\n●Hims & Hers Health暴跌16%，為連跌第七天。諾和諾德（Novo Nordisk）以侵犯專利權為由向這家遠距醫療（telehealth）公司提起告訴。此前，在美國食藥管理局（FDA）強烈反對下，Hims & Hers Health在推出僅48小時後後又立即下架一款售價僅49美元的諾和諾德減肥藥Wegovy仿製藥。",

      "Content": "AWS deepens STMicro tie with 24.8 million-share warrant deal\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 1:06 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: STM\n\nAMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Web Services appears to be tightening its grip on critical data-center infrastructure by deepening its relationship with STMicroelectronics NV ( NYSE:STM ), as the cloud unit looks to secure a broader range of semiconductor technologies for its hyperscale operations. Under the agreement disclosed on Monday, STMicro will supply AWS with chips supporting high-bandwidth connectivity and energy-efficient power management, components that are increasingly relevant as AI workloads place heavier demands on data-center performance and power efficiency. The structure of the deal suggests AWS is positioning itself not just as a customer, but as a long-term partner as global data-center build-outs accelerate.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAlongside the commercial supply arrangement, AWS received warrants to acquire up to 24.8 million ordinary STMicro shares, with vesting linked to AWS's purchases of STMicro products over time. The warrants can be exercised over a seven-year period at an initial exercise price of $28.38, giving AWS the flexibility to build an equity position in stages. STMicro shares rose 6.5% at the market open to $26.51 following the announcement, while for AWS the move represents at least its second investment in a semiconductor company, reinforcing the view that cloud operators could increasingly blend procurement and capital allocation to secure strategic supply.\n\nThe backdrop to the agreement is a widening semiconductor opportunity driven by AI-related data-center investment, where demand is extending beyond advanced processors into analog chips used for power management, sensing, and cooling. STMicro, which supplies customers such as Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), recently forecast first-quarter revenue that came in above analysts' expectations, with consumer electronics demand showing signs of recovery late last year after a prolonged slump. At the same time, management has cautioned that the rebound remains uneven, with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery noting that the automotive market is not yet stable, suggesting that AI-driven infrastructure demand could be an important, though not uniform, support for the company's outlook.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nARENA Private Wealth, a Midwest RIA Firm, Plays a Leading Role in $230M Series B for Positron AI\n\nPR Newswire\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 12:12 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: POSC\n\nARM\n\nMidwest-based RIA steps into growth-stage capital leadership role typically held by coastal venture firms.\nCHICAGO , Feb. 9, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- ARENA Private Wealth, a Midwest-based registered investment advisor with offices in Chicago, Cleveland, and Columbus, today announced that it played the lead role in a $230 million Series B fundraising round for Positron AI, a growth-stage technology company building energy-efficient AI inference hardware. The round values Positron at over $1 billion, achieving unicorn status, and was announced at the Web Summit Qatar.\nThe Series B was led by ARENA Private Wealth alongside Jump Trading and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Arm Holdings, and Helena, as well as participation from existing investors. Capital raises of this size and stature are most often led by technology-focused venture capital firms based on the coasts, making ARENA's leadership role a notable departure from the traditional Series B playbook.\n\nRather than operating as a traditional venture capital firm, ARENA approaches growth-stage investing as an alternative capital partner. The firm positions itself as a bridge between private wealth and founders through an integrated platform spanning Private Wealth, Alternatives, and Capital Markets.\nFor ARENA's investors, this model provides access to differentiated direct investment opportunities that are typically available only through large venture funds or institutional vehicles. Through ARENA's relationships, diligence process, and ability to structure and lead transactions, investors can participate directly in opportunities like Positron, gaining exposure at a meaningful stage while remaining aligned with a disciplined, long-term approach to risk.\n\n\"Opportunities like this are rare, and that's exactly why they can be so meaningful for our investors,\" said Ari Schottenstein, Head of Alternatives at ARENA Private Wealth. \"We say no far more often than we say yes, and when we do step forward, it's because we've done the work to understand the risks and believe the opportunity justifies that responsibility. Positron stood out because the leadership, market position, and timing aligned in a way that allowed us to bring something truly differentiated to our clients.\"\nFor founders, ARENA offers capital without competing interests and a fundraising option that operates outside traditional venture networks. In addition to capital, founders gain access to a broader and less homogeneous network, a strategic perspective informed by multiple markets and asset classes, and a collaborative partner focused on execution, alignment, and long-term value creation.\n\nStory Continues\n\"As a founder, you're used to thinking about venture firms and strategic investors as your primary options,\" said Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron AI. \"What stood out about working with ARENA was their ability to show up as a true capital partner, bringing collaborative strategy, access to an expansive network of relationships, and a new perspective that helped us think differently about how we scale.\"\n\n\"This investment reflects how growth-stage companies are opening the door to who they want at the table,\" said Schottenstein. \"Positron has shipping traction today and a credible roadmap ahead, and our role was to support that vision by showing up with broader investor support and alignment around long-term value creation.\"\nThe Positron transaction marks an inflection point in the technology capital landscape, driven by rising investor interest in alternative investments. ARENA's role illustrates how a modern private wealth firm can lead this next chapter as a relevant capital partner, stepping forward with conviction to source and shape opportunities, expanding the network of capital and ideas that support growth-stage companies.\n\nAbout ARENA Private Wealth\nARENA Private Wealth is a Midwest-based wealth management firm offering an integrated platform across Private Wealth, Alternatives, and Capital Markets. With offices in Chicago, Cleveland, and Columbus, ARENA connects clients to differentiated opportunities through deep relationships, disciplined diligence, and a coordinated approach to long-term portfolio strategy.

      "Content": "AMAT to Post Q1 Earnings: Time to Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?\n\nSubham Roy\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 6:58 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMAT\n\nApplied Materials AMAT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 12.\nFor the fiscal first quarter, AMAT expects revenues to be $6.85 billion (+/- $500 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.89 billion, suggesting a decline of 3.87% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.\nApplied Materials projects non-GAAP earnings to be $2.18 (+/- $0.20). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.19 per share, indicating a decline of 7.98% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMAT has an impressive earnings surprise history. AMAT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.17%.\nApplied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\nEarnings Whispers for AMAT Stock Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for AMAT this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($2.26 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.19 per share), is +3.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: AMAT carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nFactors to Consider for AMAT’s Q1 FY26 AMAT’s wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is experiencing increased demand due to a rise in the usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC). In the previous quarter, AMAT reported that its leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and advanced packaging will be the fastest-growing areas of the WFE market.\nAMAT’s flash memory or NAND sales nearly doubled to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2025 from the year-ago sales of $747.4 million. Although AMAT has a lower market share in the NAND space, it is gaining prominence. This trend is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supporting AMAT’s top-line growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ leadership in GAA transistors at 2nm and below, Backside power delivery, Advanced wiring and interconnect, HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology, which are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips, are likely to have driven AMAT’s semiconductor segment in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nAMAT’s display business has rebounded in the fiscal 2025 with year-over-year growth of 19.8%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the display revenues grew 68.2% year over year as Applied Materials shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly. These factors are likely to have benefited AMAT’s corporate and other segment’s revenues.\n\nThe company’s Applied Global Services segment is also likely to have seen steady growth, aided by strong demand for comprehensive service agreements and the expansion of its subscription-based business.\nApplied Materials’ Price Performance & Valuation Applied Materials shares have gained 74.9% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has gained 19.4%.\nAMAT 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLet us now look at the value Applied Materials offers to its investors at current levels. AMAT is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 8.46X compared with the industry’s 8.26X.\nAMAT Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Thesis on Applied Materials Applied Materials operates in a highly competitive market space where it faces competition from players, including Lam Research LRCX in the semiconductor space, ASML Holding ASML in the photolithography and advanced manufacturing equipment segment. KLA Corporation KLAC is a dominant competitor in the wafer inspection space.\nFor instance, Lam Research develops Atomic Layer Deposition tools like AT200M, AT410 and AT650P that are similar to the devices made by AMAT. Both ASML and AMAT specialize in advanced semiconductor nodes, although developing solutions for various stages of semiconductor production. ASML Holding develops lithography solutions, including EXE and NXE systems.\n\nApplied Materials and KLA Corporation offer similar solutions, such as Wafer Inspection, Yield Enhancement and Process Control inspection systems. KLA Corporation develops inspection systems, including 3935 and 3920 EP broadband plasma defect inspection systems. Although Applied Materials is dealing with a broader market sell-off and growing competition, not everything is gloom and doom for the company.\n\nApplied Materials leads the market with its superior design wins. It is well-positioned to capitalize on the technology-inflection-led growing demand for next-generation chips on the back of its product innovations and leadership in leading-edge logic, compute memory, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\nAMAT is likely to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand. The company has made significant strides in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, particularly in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. These innovations are critical to enabling faster, more energy-efficient AI processing.\n\nConclusion: Buy AMAT Stock Now AMAT is gaining from continuous strength across wafer fabrication equipment for foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND, flash memory, GAA and advanced packaging driven by increased usage of semiconductors in artificial intelligence and HPC. AMAT’s HBM stacking and hybrid bonding and 3D device metrology technologies are indispensable for manufacturing next-generation semiconductor chips. Considering these factors, we suggest investors buy this stock now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "Content": "Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRUS\n\nAMAT\n\nHave you been paying attention to shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $144.76 in the previous session. Cirrus Logic has gained 20.5% since the start of the year compared to the -0.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3.2% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 3, 2026, Cirrus Logic reported EPS of $2.97 versus consensus estimate of $2.42.\nFor the current fiscal year, Cirrus Logic is expected to post earnings of $8.51 per share on $1.94 in revenues. This represents a 12.86% change in EPS on a 2.35% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.77 per share on $2.03 in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.03% and 4.48%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics Though Cirrus Logic has recently hit a 52-week high, what is next for Cirrus Logic? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). The individual style scores for Value, Growth, Momentum and the combined VGM Score run from A through F. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nCirrus Logic has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 37.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.4X versus its peer group's average of 23.4X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cirrus Logic currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cirrus Logic fits the bill.

Here's what you need to know today.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nHow will Amazon's deal impact STMicroelectronics?\n\nWhy are Novo Nordisk shares rising today?\n\nWhat's behind Kroger's CEO hiring decision?\n\nWhat drove the Dow above 50,000 for first time?\n\nStock Futures Slip After Friday's Huge Gains Stock futures are down slightly Monday as investors look ahead to a busy week of earnings and economic reports. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down 0.1% recently, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The major indexes soared on Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading, with the Dow gaining 1,200 points to close above 50,000 for the first time. Bitcoin was at $69,000 this morning, down from a Sunday high of around $72,000 but well up from last week's low of around $60,000 , the cryptocurrency's lowest level since late 2024. Gold futures were recently up 1% at $5,030 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $63.75 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.24%, up from 4.20% at Friday's close.\n\nBusy Week of Earnings, Economic Data Ahead Investors are preparing for a busy week of earnings reports and the release of economic data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.

Hims & Hers said over the weekend that it will stop offering its compounded semaglutide pill just days after launching the product . The pill was marketed as having the same active ingredient as Novo's Wegovy pill that received FDA approval in December . The FDA said on Friday that it planned to \"take decisive steps to restrict\" the use of GLP-1 active ingredients in compounded versions of the popular weight loss medications, citing Hims & Hers by name in the statement. Novo Nordisk on Monday announced a lawsuit against Hims & Hers, saying it is asking a court to \"permanently ban Hims from selling unapproved, compounded drugs that infringe our patents, and is seeking to recover damages.\" Shares of Novo Nordisk were up more than 5% in recent premarket trading, while Hims shares sank 20% to their lowest levels since September 2024.\n\nStory Continues\nKroger Rises on Naming of New CEO Kroger ( KR ) stock is gaining ground this morning following news the grocery giant has hired former Walmart ( WMT ) executive Greg Foran to be its CEO. The Wall Street Journal had reported on Sunday that the decision had been made and that an announcement was imminent. Foran served as head of Walmart's U.S. business from 2014 to 2019, before spending the next several years leading Air New Zealand as CEO. Kroger has been looking for a new CEO for nearly a year, since previous CEO Rodney McMullen was dismissed in March 2025 over an undisclosed ethics violation. Foran was identified as a potential candidate by Wall Street analysts in the weeks after McMullen was fired, as they said a former Walmart executive could help Kroger compete with the nation's largest retailer. Kroger's move comes at a busy time for executive changes in retail, as Walmart itself and rival Target ( TGT ) each recently welcomed new CEOs . Kroger shares were up 7% recently.\n\nSTMicroelectronics Stock Jumps on Amazon Deal Shares of STMicroelectronics ( STM ) are surging after the European chipmaker announced a new deal with Amazon ( AMZN ). The company said Monday that it has agreed to a \"multi-year, multi-billion\" dollar deal to supply Amazon Web Services with a range of semiconductors. The chipmaker also said it has issued warrants that would allow Amazon to acquire up to 24.8 million shares in the company over the next several years as part of the deal. Amazon and other tech giants have laid out plans in recent weeks to substantially increase their spending on artificial intelligence projects this year, including building data centers and buying the equipment to run them. Amazon said last week its capital expenditures could reach up to $200 billion this year. U.S.-traded shares of STMicroelectronics were up 7% recently. Amazon stock was little changed after tumbling Friday following the company's announcement of the big spending plans and a weaker-than-expected earnings report.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Return Trends At NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) Look Promising\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nFinding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at NXP Semiconductors ( NASDAQ:NXPI ) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NXP Semiconductors:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.15 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2025) .\nThus, NXP Semiconductors has an ROCE of 15%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.1% generated by the Semiconductor industry.\nSee our latest analysis for NXP Semiconductors\nIn the above chart we have measured NXP Semiconductors' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for NXP Semiconductors .\nThe Trend Of ROCE We like the trends that we're seeing from NXP Semiconductors. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 15%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 27%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nThe Bottom Line In summary, it's great to see that NXP Semiconductors can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 26% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\n\nStory Continues\nLike most companies, NXP Semiconductors does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

The S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.8%. The key event of the week was the tech stock rout. Wall Street has been skeptical about software stocks in recent times, but a phase of outright panic hit last week.\n\nTraders dumped shares across the sector as fears mount that artificial intelligence (AI) could fundamentally disrupt software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models.The anxiety intensified on Feb. 3, 2026, after AI startup Anthropic unveiled a productivity tool aimed at in-house lawyers. The announcement triggered a sharp selloff in legal software and publishing stocks, per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nMeanwhile, six out of all Mag 7 members have reported their Q4 results, with just NVDA remaining.

While Amazon remains the cloud leader, the Alphabet report showed accelerating momentum at the search giant&rsquo;s Google Cloud business (read: Amazon Drops on Mixed Q4 & Capex Outlook: Buy the Dip With ETFs?).\n\nIn a nutshell, combining the actual results for the six Magnificent 7 members that have reported already along with estimates for Nvidia, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up 24.2% from the same period last year on 18.9% higher revenues, which would follow the group&rsquo;s 28.3% earnings growth on 18.1% revenue growth in 2025 Q3, per Zacks Earnings Trends.\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight the winning leveraged ETFs of last week.\nWinning Leveraged ETFs in Focus Tradr 2X Long LITE Daily ETF LITX &ndash; Up 79.5%\nLumentum Holdings Inc LITE stock surged 36.3% last week on the earnings strength.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Chip Stock Could Be a Top Performer by 2027\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 2:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TXN\n\nNVDA\n\nWhen investors look at investing in computer chips to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they are likely to start with a company like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . That makes sense, given that it makes the most popular chips for handling AI workloads. However, there's another chip stock that could also turn out to be a huge AI winner: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) .\n\nWhat does Texas Instruments do? Nvidia makes high-powered parallel processing chips that act as the primary brains that undergird AI software. Texas Instruments makes analog chips, the boring ones that convert physical events into digital signals. When you push a button on a digital device, it is likely being controlled by an analog chip. Texas Instruments' chips are simple, relatively low cost, and can be found in tech products virtually everywhere.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nIn the artificial intelligence hardware world, Texas Instruments' chips provide power management. That's a vital function within the data centers that house AI. Given the expectation that the AI infrastructure buildout is only just beginning, Texas Instruments could have years of growth ahead of it in this end market.\n\nTexas Instruments is gearing up Over the last few years, the analog chip sector has been in a rut. However, Texas Instruments has been investing in new chip production capacity. Just recently, it agreed to buy competitor Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) . In other words, Texas Instruments is preparing for growth.\nIt is also shifting the way it reports its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company broke out its data center business as a separate end market. The segment accounted for around 9% of the top line. However, it grew 64% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's probably not a number to bake into your growth expectations, given that the AI opportunity is brand new. Still, revenue rose by a mid-single-digit percentage from the third quarter. If this is just the beginning of the AI buildout, this segment could help supercharge an upturn in the typically cyclical analog chip sector and support growth for years to come.\nTexas Instruments is an analog leader There are other analog chipmakers , and there are chipmakers that make more exciting chips than Texas Instruments. However, for most investors, opening a position in this industry-leading company will probably set you up for long-term success. And given the strength of the business and the company's growth efforts, the AI buildout could easily turn Texas Instruments into a top-performing chipmaker by 2027, if not sooner.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Texas Instruments right now? Before you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Texas Instruments wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $443,299 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,136,601 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 914 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "What Are Wall Street Analysts' Target Price for NXP Semiconductors Stock?\n\nAanchal Sugandh\nMon, February 9, 2026 at 12:08 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\n^GSPC\n\nHeadquartered in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) designs and delivers advanced chips across processors, connectivity, analog, security, and sensor technologies. With a market cap of roughly $56.5 billion, the company forms the invisible backbone of vehicles, factories, Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, mobile devices, and modern communications infrastructure.\n\nWhile the business footprint looks expansive, stock performance has introduced a more restrained narrative. Over the past 52 weeks, NXPI stock gained 3.5%, trailing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) 14% gain. Year-to-date (YTD), however, the stock rose 3.3%, edging past the broader index’s modest 1.3% increase.\nMore News from Barchart Inflation, Earnings and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\nWhy Alphabet's Free Cash Flow Could Survive, Despite the Market's Fears - How to Play GOOGL\nShould You Buy AT&T Stock After Its Amazon Leo Win?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nPlacing that performance within the sector sharpens perspective. The State Street SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) surged 45.3% over the same 52-week period and added 11.6% YTD.\nOn Feb. 2, NXP Semiconductors reported its Q4 2025 earnings results, immediately lifting the stock 2.2%. Revenue grew 7.2% year over year to $3.34 billion, topping the $3.3 billion analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS rose 5.3% to $3.35, clearing Wall Street’s $3.30 forecast with room to spare.\n\nDespite beating headline estimates, NXPI stock slid 4.5% in the next trading session as investors focused on elevated inventories and emerging signs of long-term margin pressure. However, management countered with a strategic reset anchored in “physical artificial intelligence (AI),” emphasizing accelerating demand for industrial products with built-in intelligence at the edge.\nLeadership also cited stronger regional manufacturing amid geopolitical pressure. As automakers stop trimming orders and inventory correction fades, management now sees visibility into growth from next-generation, AI-enabled products.\nThe outlook carries into the forward estimates. For fiscal year 2026, ending in December, analysts project diluted EPS of $12.37, implying 21.3% year-over-year growth. Importantly, NXP Semiconductors has beaten EPS expectations in three of the past four quarters, missing only once.\nWall Street sentiment remains firmly supportive, assigning NXPI stock an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Out of 30 analysts, 22 rate NXPI stock a “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” and six suggest “Hold.”\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, the outlook remains unchanged from three months ago, when 22 analysts also labeled the stock a “Strong Buy.”\nWhile NXPI stock has lagged peers from a growth standpoint, recent demand commentary appears stronger than that of many competitors. Reinforcing this view, TD Cowen raised its price target to $285 from $260 on Jan. 16 while maintaining a “Buy” rating on the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, analyst targets paint a clearer picture of what the market believes the stock can deliver. NXPI’s average price target of $259.67 implies potential upside of 15.8%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $324.40 suggests a gain of 44.6% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "5 Insightful Analyst Questions From NXP Semiconductors’s Q4 Earnings Call\n\nKayode Omotosho\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 9:31 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NXPI\n\nNXP Semiconductors’ fourth quarter saw year-over-year growth driven by improved demand across automotive and industrial end markets. Management attributed the quarter’s performance to a rebound in automotive revenue, particularly as inventory adjustment cycles wound down, and to broad-based strength in industrial and IoT segments. CEO Rafael Sotomayor noted, “Our auto business returned to growth year-over-year, and the guide we provided continues that trend.” However, management also acknowledged that persistent weakness in communications infrastructure and the impact of recent divestitures, such as the sale of the MEMS sensor business, weighed on sentiment.\nMore from Yahoo Scout\n\nWhat drove NXP's Q4 revenue growth and performance?\n\nHow is NXP's automotive business recovery progressing?\n\nWhat are analysts' main concerns about NXP's outlook?\n\nHow will recent business divestitures impact NXP's future revenue?\n\nIs now the time to buy NXPI?

      "Content": "Rambus (RMBS) Valuation Check After Strong Earnings And Renewed Investor Interest\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 8:32 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: RMBS\n\nGet insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\nRambus (RMBS) has been back on investors’ radar after reporting fourth quarter 2025 revenue of US$190.24 million and net income of US$63.84 million, along with full year gains in both revenue and earnings.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Rambus.\nThe latest results and guidance have arrived against a backdrop of a 14.69% 1 month share price return and a 59.85% 1 year total shareholder return, with shorter term moves still choppy. This suggests sentiment has improved over time even as momentum occasionally cools and then picks up again.\nIf you are watching how chip related names react to earnings and guidance, this could be a good moment to broaden your search. You may also want to check out 33 AI infrastructure stocks as another way to spot opportunities tied to data and compute demand.\nWith Rambus trading around US$107.10 after strong revenue and earnings, yet appearing potentially overvalued on traditional checks, is there still an attractive entry point here, or has the market already priced in future growth?\n\nMost Popular Narrative: 10.8% Undervalued The most followed narrative sees Rambus trading below an assessed fair value of $120, compared with the current price around $107.10, which raises some clear questions about what is baked into those models.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious what kind of revenue build and margin profile sit behind that $120 fair value mark, and how much earnings power the narrative assumes Rambus can sustain across its licensing and chip businesses? The full breakdown spells out the growth rates, profitability path, and valuation multiple needed to make that number work.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $120 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, this hinges on upbeat assumptions. Any slowdown in DDR5 or MRDIMM adoption, or tougher competition in high value IP, could quickly challenge that 10.8% undervalued case.\nFind out about the key risks to this Rambus narrative.\nAnother View: Rich Earnings Multiple Raises the Bar That 10.8% undervalued narrative sits against a very different signal from Rambus’ current P/E of about 50x. That is higher than both the US Semiconductor peer average of 35.8x and an estimated fair ratio of 42.5x, which suggests less room for error if growth or margins soften.\n\nStory Continues\nFor you, the question is whether this premium feels earned, or whether it leaves too little cushion if sentiment or earnings expectations shift.\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Rambus Narrative If you feel differently about these assumptions and would rather test the numbers yourself, you can build a custom Rambus view in minutes by starting with Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Rambus research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 1 important warning sign that could impact your investment decision.\nReady to hunt for more investment ideas?

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\nIf you are wondering whether Rambus at around US$107.10 is still a sensible entry or worth holding, the key question is how its current price lines up with underlying business value.\nThe share price has been volatile recently, with a 5.9% decline over the last 7 days, a 14.7% gain over 30 days, a 7.9% return year to date, 59.9% over 1 year, 136.4% over 3 years and a very large 392.0% over 5 years. This naturally raises questions about risk and potential future returns.\nAlongside these returns, Rambus has been in focus for its role in the semiconductor space, where memory interface and security technology are central topics for investors following chips and data center trends. This context helps explain why the stock has drawn attention during broader discussions about chip demand, capital investment in computing infrastructure and the supporting ecosystem.\nDespite this interest, Rambus currently scores 0 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown in our valuation score . Next we will walk through what traditional valuation methods are saying about the stock today and then finish with a framework that can help you interpret those numbers in a more complete way.\n\nRambus scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Rambus Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company might be worth by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today, so you can compare that value with the current share price.\nFor Rambus, the model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $288.08 million. Analyst inputs and extrapolations point to free cash flow of $301.65 million in 2026 and $480.75 million in 2028, with further projections out to 2035, all expressed in discounted terms to reflect their value in today’s dollars.\n\nWhen these projected cash flows are totaled and adjusted for shareholders, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $72.94 per share. Against a recent share price of around $107.10, this implies the stock is about 46.8% above the DCF estimate. This suggests Rambus currently screens as overvalued on this particular cash flow model.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Rambus may be overvalued by 46.8%.

It helps you gauge how many dollars of share price the market is asking for each dollar of earnings.\nWhat counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on how investors view a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nRambus is currently trading on a P/E of about 50.0x. That is above the Semiconductor industry average of about 44.0x and above the peer group average of about 35.8x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Rambus is 42.5x, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.\nThe Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it weighs those company specific inputs rather than assuming one size fits all. With the current P/E of 50.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 42.5x, Rambus screens as trading above that customized benchmark.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nP/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?

Discover our 22 top founder-led companies .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Rambus Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way for you to attach your own story about Rambus to the numbers behind its fair value, revenue, earnings and margins.\nA Narrative is your view of what a company is and where it could go, translated into a financial forecast that links the business story to estimates, then to a fair value you can compare with today’s price.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives live inside the Community page. Millions of investors use them as an easy tool to see whether their Fair Value suggests the stock is priced attractively or richly, and those Narratives update automatically as new earnings, news or other information comes through.\n\nFor Rambus, one investor might set a cautious Narrative with modest revenue growth and a lower fair value than US$107.10. Another might assume stronger growth, higher margins and a fair value above the current price, which shows how the same stock can fit very different approaches.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Rambus?

      "Content": "Has The Recent Arm (ARM) Share Price Jump Created A Valuation Opportunity?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 12:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nIf you are wondering whether Arm Holdings is fairly priced or if the recent buzz has left the stock looking expensive or attractive, this article walks through what the numbers say about its value.\nArm's share price recently closed at US$123.70, with returns of 17.4% over the last 7 days and 10.7% over the last 30 days, while the 1 year return sits at a 23.9% decline and the year to date return is 7.8%.\nRecent attention on Arm has focused on its role as a key semiconductor designer that many chipmakers license. This keeps it in the spotlight whenever investors are thinking about demand for computing and AI related hardware. Coverage has also highlighted how chip related names can see sharp swings in sentiment, which helps explain why Arm's share price can move quickly when expectations shift.\nRight now Arm scores 1 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by its valuation score . In this article we look at what traditional models such as P/E comparisons and discounted cash flow can and cannot tell you about that number, before finishing with a broader way to think about Arm's valuation.\n\nArm Holdings scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Arm Holdings Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes projected future cash flows and discounts them back to today using a required rate of return. The result is an estimate of what the company might be worth based on its potential to generate cash for shareholders.\nFor Arm Holdings, the model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow (FCF) is about $1.16b. Analysts and model estimates project FCF reaching $4.51b by the year ending March 2030, with a path of annual forecasts and extrapolated figures between 2026 and 2035. Simply Wall St uses analyst estimates where available for the earlier years and then extends those trends further out in time.\n\nBringing all of those projected cash flows back to today gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $52.92 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $123.70, the DCF output implies the stock is very expensive, with an intrinsic discount figure that indicates Arm is assessed to be 133.8% overvalued on this model.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Arm Holdings may be overvalued by 133.8%. Discover 52 high quality undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\n\nStory Continues\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Arm Holdings.\nApproach 2: Arm Holdings Price vs Sales For profitable businesses like Arm Holdings, revenue-based metrics such as the P/S ratio can be a useful way to gauge what the market is willing to pay for each dollar of sales, especially when margins and earnings can be influenced by accounting or investment cycles.\nIn general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to justify a higher “normal” or “fair” P/S multiple. Slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower multiple. That context helps you judge whether a current ratio looks stretched or conservative.\n\nArm is currently trading on a P/S ratio of 28.12x. That is well above the Semiconductor industry average of 5.76x and also above the peer average of 9.46x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Arm, which is 41.75x, is a proprietary estimate of what the P/S might be given factors such as Arm’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for those company-specific drivers rather than treating all semiconductor stocks as alike. Since Arm’s actual P/S of 28.12x sits below the Fair Ratio of 41.75x, the multiple-based view points to the shares looking undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nP/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 22 top founder-led companies .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Arm Holdings Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company connected directly to your assumptions for fair value, future revenue, earnings and margins.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page and let you turn your view on Arm Holdings into a clear forecast. This can then be turned into a fair value that you can compare with today’s price to decide whether the stock looks appealing, fully priced or expensive to you.\n\nBecause Narratives update when new information such as fresh earnings reports or major news comes in, your fair value view can stay aligned with what is happening rather than being stuck in a one off spreadsheet.\nFor example, one Arm Narrative on the Community page might assume stronger revenue growth, higher long term profit margins and a higher fair value. Another might assume more modest growth, lower margins and a lower fair value, showing how two investors can look at the same company and reach very different conclusions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Arm Holdings?

      "Content": "Arm’s Record Q3 Puts AI And Data Center Shift In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, February 8, 2026 at 9:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nArm Holdings (NasdaqGS:ARM) reported record Q3 results, with strong contributions from AI and data center related revenues.\nThe company is shifting from a mainly mobile focused business toward a broader AI and compute platform role.\nNew partnerships with large cloud hyperscalers and expanded compute subsystems are gaining traction across customers.\nManagement highlighted increased R&D commitments that support this repositioning in AI and data center markets.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:ARM, the share price sits at $123.7, with a 17.4% gain over the past week and 10.7% over the past month. Over the past year, the stock shows a 23.9% decline, so the recent move comes against a weaker 12 month backdrop. That mix of short term strength and longer term pressure helps frame how the market is reacting to Arm's Q3 news and changing business profile.\nLooking ahead, the key questions are how durable AI and data center demand will be for Arm, and how quickly new compute subsystems and hyperscaler partnerships translate into broader revenue streams. The company is putting clear emphasis on R&D and deeper platform engagement with players like AWS, NVIDIA and Microsoft. These initiatives may influence where Arm ultimately fits within evolving compute architectures.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Arm Holdings by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Arm Holdings.\nHow Arm Holdings stacks up against its biggest competitors\nArm's record Q3 shows how quickly its business mix is tilting toward AI and data center workloads, with revenue of US$1.24b versus US$983m a year earlier and royalty and licensing activity supported by higher value architectures and pre integrated compute subsystems. For you as an investor, the key shift is that Arm is moving from a mainly smartphone royalty story to a broader compute platform that competes more directly with CPU ecosystems from Intel, AMD and emerging RISC V designs across cloud, edge and automotive use cases.\n\nArm Holdings narrative, from mobile IP vendor to AI compute platform The latest results fit neatly into existing narratives that Arm is leveraging its large customer base and developer community to extend into data centers, edge AI and physical AI applications such as robotics and self driving systems. At the same time, earlier narrative flags about patent expirations in the 2030s, high R&D intensity and SoftBank's control are still part of the story, so this pivot toward higher value AI centric products can be seen as an attempt to deepen monetization per chip rather than radically expand the customer count.\n\nStory Continues\nRisks and rewards investors should keep in mind Q3 revenue of US$1.24b and nine month revenue of US$3.43b show that Arm is already operating at scale in AI focused segments, with data center royalties and higher rate products contributing meaningfully.\nExpanded partnerships with hyperscalers such as AWS, NVIDIA and Microsoft, and traction for compute subsystems, give Arm more ways to participate as customers move to custom silicon and AI specific chips.\nNet income in Q3 moved from US$252m to US$223m even as revenue rose, hinting that higher R&D and go to market spending could weigh on margins while the new AI and data center businesses mature.\nManagement and analysts still point to risks around smartphone exposure, memory chip shortages, competition from RISC V and geopolitical issues, which could limit how smooth this business model shift proves to be.\n\nWhat to watch next From here, it will be important to see whether AI and data center royalties continue to gain share of Arm's overall mix, and whether higher R&D spending starts to show up in sustained profit growth rather than just top line momentum. You can keep track of how different investors are interpreting this shift and how it ties into longer term expectations by checking community narratives for Arm on the company’s dedicated page , especially as new guidance, product launches and hyperscaler roadmaps are announced through 2026.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.
