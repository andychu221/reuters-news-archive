On February 5, Goldman Sachs revised its Buy rating for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with a $250 price target. The firm anticipates a beat-and-raise quarter for the tech giant, citing strong industry supply/demand trends, though it admits that projections for outperformance have already become high.\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nGoldman Sachs believes that near-term stock price growth will be dependent on insight into 2027 revenue, as the upside potential for 2026 has already been built into the stock. The firm highlighted several possible catalysts for higher earnings in the first half of 2026, including sustained positive adjustments to hyperscaler capital expenditure through 2027 and growing trust in demand from unconventional clients like AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nAdditionally, Goldman Sachs emphasized that NVIDIA’s tech superiority might be strengthened by the impressive performance outcomes of new large language models trained on the company’s Blackwell architecture.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Hold with a $154 price target. Deutsche expects Airbnb's hotel business to grow while its AI native search drives up conversions. While the company is \"not immune from AI disintermediation,\" it is \"more shielded than others,\" contends Deutsche Bank, which sees a \"compelling\" risk/reward at Airbnb's current share levels. Evercore ISI also upgraded Airbnb to Outperform from In Line with a $145 price target.\nArgus upgraded McDonald's (MCD) to Buy from Hold with a $380 price target. The company is well positioned to attract budget-conscious consumers thanks to its value menus and sales promotions, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $23, up from $16, following the Q4 report. The firm sees early signs the company's \"prospects are inflecting.\" UBS upgraded Rivian to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $16, up from $15, following the Q4 report.\nHSBC upgraded CrowdStrike (CRWD) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $446. The firm cites the stock's \"attractive\" valuation and the company's AI growth for the upgrade.\nRosenblatt upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $118, up from $106. Roku \"handily beat\" Q4 estimates and guided above expectations for Q1 and 2026, says the firm, which adds that the outlook \"looks beatable again.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $19, down from $38, following the earnings report. The firm sees more limited visibility going forward for Pinterest due to tariffs and the company's sales reorganization. Loop Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, Baird, RBC, Deutsche Bank and BofA also downgraded Pinterest to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\nBMO Capital downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $95, down from $110. The current valuation and earnings expectations for the company may be too elevated given that Dollar Tree lacks investments and focus on offering a compelling digital strategy, which may limit top line growth over time, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan downgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $20, down from $28, after the company announced that Harry Sommer, its CEO and director, departed and resigned from the board on February 12 as part of a strategic leadership change.\nPiper Sandler downgraded US Foods (USFD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $103, up from $85. The firm calls the downgrade a valuation driven and risk/reward based decision post the company's Q4 report.\nCitizens downgraded Upstart (UPST) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade.\n\nStory Continues\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with a Neutral rating and $220 price target, calling it \"a marginal AI accelerator player that is in the act of playing catch-up.\" While AMD's Instinct GPUs \"benchmark great on paper,\" the \"reality is that customers are not buying spec sheets\" and running frontier workloads across tens of thousands of GPUs is an interconnect and systems-integration problem, the firm argues.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. The stock is reflecting assumptions that are \"too optimistic,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays reinstated coverage of Medtronic (MDT) with an Overweight rating and $116 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on February 17. The firm expects the company to report strong earnings growth.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with a Neutral rating and $335 price target. The company's AI application-specific integrated circuits exposure does not warrant a premium multiple versus market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA) , the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of TSMC (TSM) with a Buy rating and $450 price target.

      "Content": "Rivian surges over 20% on delivery guidance, R2 launch in Q2; CEO says 'key inflection' reached The EV maker also posted a gross profit for Q4, driven by its software and services unit.\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nALI=F\n\nRivian ( RIVN ) stock surged on Friday morning after the EV-maker reported strong delivery guidance for the year, as it ramps up for the release of its R2 vehicle which the company said is on track for the second quarter of this year.\nThe company expects vehicle deliveries for 2026 in a range of 62,000 to 67,000 units, meeting Wall Street estimates of around 63,400 units and suggesting the upcoming R2 will boost sales.\nCrucially, the company said its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle is targeting customer deliveries for the second quarter, after early manufacturing validation builds rolled off the assembly line in January.\nRivian stock surged over 20% in early trade on Friday.\n\n\"This is for us a really key inflection here, where we're going to demonstrate the long term profitability of the business with R2, such an important program for us in terms of adding scale to business,\" CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nThat being said, Rivian sees its adjusted EBITDA loss for 2026 in a range of $1.80 billion to $2.10 billion versus a loss of $1.8 billion expected, with capital expenditures of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, meeting estimates of $2.05 billion.\n\n\"RIVN provided solid FY26 delivery guidance while providing EBITDA targets below the Street expectations as the company ramps its new and existing vehicle lines to generate stable revenue growth while investing strategically across the business,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients.\nAnd for a second quarter in a row, the company posted a gross profit of $120 million, broken down between a loss of $59 million for the automotive segment and a $179 million gain from software and services. Rivian said the jump in software and services profit is due to \"vehicle architecture and software development services\" stemming from its joint venture with Volkswagen ( VOW3.DE ).\nFor the year, Rivian's adjusted EBITDA loss came in at $2.063 billion, wider than estimates of $1.8 billion but within the company's forecast. Capital expenditures for the year hit $1.710 billion, versus estimates of $2.05 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents tallied $6.082 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, around $1 billion less than last quarter. Rivian said it had $6.588 million in total liquidity — crucial as it ramps up R2 production.\n\"We will be opportunistic with regards to additional capital raises,\" Scaringe said, adding that Rivian anticipates another $2 billion in cash and debt from its joint venture with Volkswagen this year.\n\nStory Continues\nRivian's big R2's ramp up is not without risks, however.\n\"The biggest risk in our ramp up, and what we've experienced in the past, and built some skills around managing, is just the complexities of ramping a supply chain, some of the unknowns within the supply chain, and that can be as specific as memory or chip set, or it could be as broad as aluminum supply,\" Scaringe said.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.286 billion versus $1.26 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, down around 27% from a year ago. Rivian attributed the revenue declines to the loss of regulatory emissions credit sales, the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, and lower average selling prices.\nThe company posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.59 versus $0.69 expected, with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $465 million versus $568.2 million expected.\nLast month, Rivian said it produced 10,974 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Ill., and delivered 9,745 vehicles in Q4, with full-year tallies of 42,284 vehicles produced and 42,247 vehicles delivered, reaching the midpoint of its guidance range of 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles delivered. However, Rivian’s original 2025 delivery target was between 46,000 and 51,000.\n\nAs part of the R2 product initiative, the company plans to amp up its AI and tech development, which investors are keen to hear more about.\nLast December, the company said software advancements from its new Autonomy platform and Large Driving Model (LDM), an autonomous model trained similarly to a large language model (LLM), will expand its Universal Hands-Free assisted driving to second-gen R1 vehicles, covering 3.5 million miles in the US.\nLater this year, a point-to-point hands-free system will be released, followed by a hands-free and eyes-free self-driving product, with the ultimate goal of achieving \"personal Level 4\" autonomy, meaning the vehicle will be able to drive fully on its own without requiring the driver's attention.",

And its opportunity with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) is even bigger.\nThe company should be a big winner from Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) huge AI infrastructure spending surge, because Broadcom helps the leader in artificial intelligence make the tensor processing units (TPUs) that power its AI workloads. Meanwhile, Alphabet is beginning to let customers use TPUs for their own workloads through Google Cloud, and Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion order.\n\nOther hyperscalers are also turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, opening up an enormous growth opportunity over the next few years.\nAlphabet Alphabet is becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI. Its core Google Search revenue has accelerated with the introduction of new AI features, and its Gemini AI model has been recognized as among the best. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit has been on fire, with revenue surging 48% last quarter.\nThe company plans to spend big on AI infrastructure this year to capture the opportunity it is seeing. This is a good move, since its TPUs give it a big structural cost advantage over competitors, at less than half the price of Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company's decision to start letting customers deploy these chips within Google Cloud opens up another big revenue driver, with Morgan Stanley estimating that Alphabet has generated $13 billion in revenue for every 500,000 TPUs deployed. As the company with the most complete AI stack -- from its own custom chips to a leading AI model -- Alphabet is a stock to own for the next few years and beyond.\nMicron Technology One of the biggest bottlenecks in building AI infrastructure right now is memory. AI chips need to be packaged with high bandwidth memory (HBM) to optimize their performance, but the process to make HBM is complex and requires upward of three times the wafer capacity of ordinary DRAM (dynamic random-access memory). This has left the entire DRAM market in short supply and is leading to surging prices.\n\nStory Continues\nAs one of the three big DRAM makers -- along with South Korean companies SK Hynix and Samsung -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one of the best ways to play this dynamic. The current environment is leading to surging sales and huge gross margin increases.\nAnd with demand increasing rapidly, the current supply/demand situation for DRAM is likely to remain very tight over the next few years, despite Micron and others increasing capacity.

Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) was one of the quantum darlings, but shares are now about 75% off their highs from last fall.\nThe plunge continued this week, with Rigetti shares down 15.4% as of Friday morning, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence .\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nWall Street's thumbs down This week's drop came after reports that TD Cowen analyst Krish Sinkar downgraded Rigetti stock. Sinkar thinks investors have gotten ahead of themselves with Rigetti. He also believes forward estimates for 2027 are too aggressive.\nThat's mainly because revenue potential could be lower than many believe. Rigetti reported only $1.9 million in third-quarter revenue, while investors are valuing the company at a market cap of nearly $5 billion. That's down from over $18 billion last fall, but it's still lofty given the fundamentals.\n\nRigetti management even believes most demand, and therefore value, for quantum computing will materialize after 2030. Rigetti stock is starting to reflect the view that returns could still be years away. Quantum computing may ultimately give businesses, governments, and universities a much more powerful platform. But investors likely will have plenty of time to pick winners and losers in the coming years. Rigetti stock is now declining from the overexuberance seen last year.\nShould you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now? Before you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

Inclusion on the list could amount to a serious challenge for Alibaba, which is stepping up efforts to compete globally in artificial intelligence.\n“There’s no basis to conclude that Alibaba should be placed on the Section 1260H List,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy. We will take all available legal action against attempts to misrepresent our company.”\n\nBaidu’s receipts were down 4.5%. Spokespeople for Baidu didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular office hours.\nThe list, first published in 2021, now includes more than 130 entities accused of working with the Chinese military. The names include those of airlines, construction companies, shipping companies, computer hardware manufacturers and communications companies.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg had indicated in October that Alibaba, BYD, Robosense and other companies would be added to the list when he sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Bloomberg reported at the time.\nAn analysis by the law firm of Hogan and Lovells said inclusion on the 1260H List has “several direct and indirect implications,” including restrictions on US defense contracts, potential inclusion on other restricted party lists, reputational damage and increased compliance costs.\n--With assistance from Edwin Chan and Debby Wu.\n\nStory Continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

      "Content": "1 Growth Stock Down 32% to Buy Hand Over Fist in February, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: DDOG\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) developed an industry-leading cloud observability platform, which alerts businesses to technical issues with their digital infrastructure and sales channels before customers are negatively impacted.\nDatadog is now using its expertise in this field to help businesses deploy artificial intelligence (AI) software as effectively as possible. The products it has launched in this space so far are attracting significant demand, and it has even more in the pipeline. In fact, the company just reported its full-year operating results for 2025, and its revenue growth accelerated, partly thanks to its AI products.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nDatadog stock is trading almost 37% below its November 2025 record high, but Wall Street thinks this might be an opportunity. The majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given the stock a buy rating, and their consensus price target points to significant potential returns. Here's why their bullishness might be justified.\nDatadog's AI products are seeing significant demand In mid-2024, Datadog launched a product called LLM Observability, which helps developers track costs, uncover technical issues, and monitor the quality of the outputs of their large language models (LLMs). These models sit at the foundation of customer-facing AI software, so it is critical that they maintain the highest standard of quality.\nBut not every business has the financial or technical resources to build an LLM from scratch, so some of them adopt models from third-party developers like OpenAI as a shortcut. Datadog looks after these customers with a product called OpenAI Monitoring, which allows businesses to keep track of their usage, costs, response times, and error rates.\n\nBut Datadog isn't stopping there. It's gearing up to launch a series of new observability tools to track the usage and performance of AI agents and coding assistants, which could be extremely popular as more businesses and developers lean on these technologies to help improve their productivity.\nDatadog said 5,500 of its 32,700 customers were using at least one of its AI products at the end of 2025, which was up by a whopping 57% from the year-ago period. The company also said its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which is the bridge between Datadog observability data and customer AI models and software, saw a staggering 11-fold increase in requests compared to the third quarter just three months earlier. In simpler terms, usage of Datadog's AI integrations is exploding.\n\nStory Continues\nRevenue growth accelerated in 2025 Datadog generated $3.43 billion in total revenue during 2025, which was a 28% increase from the year before. It marked an acceleration from the 26% growth the company produced in 2024, and a lot of this momentum is attributable to AI customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter, for example, Datadog's revenue grew by 29% overall, but by 23% if you exclude AI-native customers (these are AI-first companies like OpenAI and Anthropic). That means this very small cohort of just 650 customers accounted for six percentage points of Datadog's total revenue growth for the period -- and this doesn't include the thousands of other customers that are also using the company's various AI tools.\n\nDatadog also had another strong year at the bottom line, bringing in $363.4 million in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income. That was up only marginally compared to 2024, mainly because the company spent aggressively in areas like research and development throughout the year to expand its AI product portfolio.\nWall Street is bullish on Datadog stock The Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts who cover Datadog stock, and 36 of them have given it a buy rating. Eight others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding, and just one recommends selling.\nThe analysts have an average share price target of $185.92, implying Datadog stock could climb by 47% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $260 suggests the stock could more than double instead.\nI think those targets are achievable if Datadog's revenue growth continues to accelerate, especially because its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7, which is near the cheapest valuation since it went public in 2019.\nLast year, Datadog valued its addressable market in the observability segment alone at $52 billion, and it expects that figure to grow by 9% per year through 2029. Based on the company's current revenue, it has barely scratched the surface of that opportunity. But remember, Datadog will soon launch entirely new products in this space for AI agents and coding assistants, which could expand the size of its observability opportunity even further than expected.\n\nAs a result, I think Wall Street analysts are right to be bullish on Datadog stock, especially at its current price.\nShould you buy stock in Datadog right now?

      "Content": "Will Data Center Unit Help NVIDIA Reach Its $65B Q4 Revenue Goal?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 25, and it would be no surprise if the company reaches another sales milestone and surpasses the $65 billion target. NVDA has been setting new sales records for the past few quarters. In the last reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, its revenues reached a new record of $57.01 billion, reflecting a 62% year-over-year increase.\n\nNVIDIA is optimistic that the growth momentum will continue as it again targets record revenues of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. The key driver behind this outlook is its booming data center business, which continues to power the company’s growth amid the global buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the data center business unit reported $51.22 billion in revenues, up 66% from last year.\nThe segment reached new highs as demand for accelerated computing, generative AI, and large-scale model training continued to rise across cloud providers and enterprise customers. Much of the momentum came from the rapid adoption of the GB300 platform and wider deployment of NVIDIA’s networking products, including NVLink and Spectrum-X. With hyperscalers racing to expand AI capacity, NVIDIA remained a key beneficiary of record spending on high-performance infrastructure.\n\nThe near-term outlook still appears solid, with the company expecting further strength from Blackwell shipments and expanding orders across cloud, sovereign AI and enterprise AI projects. NVIDIA also sees the growing adoption of agentic AI, long-context workloads and advanced inference systems, all of which depend on high-performance graphics processing unit clusters, as key catalysts for long-term growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the data center segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $58.72 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 65%.\nThe growing demand for the company’s AI chips used in data centers is likely to continue aiding its overall top-line performance. Analysts’ projections also suggest that the company is expected to surpass the fourth-quarter sales target of $65 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $65.56 billion, calling for a year-over-year surge of 66.7%.\n\nNVIDIA’s Competitors in the AI Data Center Space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC are two major companies that are competing closely with NVIDIA in the AI data center space.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is gaining traction with its MI300 series accelerators, which are designed to handle training and inference for large AI models. AMD’s chips have attracted interest from major cloud providers seeking diversification beyond NVIDIA’s ecosystem. While Advanced Micro Devices’ software stack is still developing, its performance and pricing advantages make it a credible alternative.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel is also reasserting its presence with the Gaudi series of AI accelerators. The company is positioning Gaudi3 as a cost-effective and scalable option for AI data centers, targeting enterprise clients looking for flexibility. Intel’s broad reach in CPUs and server infrastructure helps it integrate AI solutions more easily into existing systems.\n\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 34.6% over the past year compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 36%.\nNVIDIA One-Year Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.36, below the industry’s average of 28.62.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.9% and 57%, respectively. Estimates for fiscal 2026 have remained unchanged at $4.66 per share in the past 60 days. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2027 have been revised upward by 2 cents to $7.32 per share in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "Here Are Friday’s Top Wall Street Analyst Research Calls: Airbnb, AMD, Broadcom, CrowdStrike, Dollar Tree, Medtronic, Pinterest, Rivian, Roku, Tapestry, and More\n\nLee Jackson\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:01 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nCRWD\n\nDLTR\n\nkeypoints]\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\nFutures are trading higher after the January consumer price index report came in below expectations at 2.4%, as we head into the close of a rollercoaster week that saw a little of just about everything. After opening strongly on Thursday, stocks immediately rolled over. By the first hour mark, they were down sharply, and although stocks didn't close at the lows, they remained down for the rest of the session. With a variety of issues weighing on stocks and a big rotation out of technology after three years of double-digit gains, we could be setting up for a sizable correction. Losses were steep across the board Thursday, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 2.04% at 22,597. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at 6,832, down 1.57%, and the Dow Jones Industrials were last at 49,451, down 1.34%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was also down more than 2% to 2,615.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Yields plummeted across the Treasury yield curve as investors ran for the safety and security of guaranteed U.S. government paper. The rally was fueled by weak economic data, including rising jobless claims and declining job openings, which increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, with the solid jobs numbers earlier in the week, and if todays consumer price index numbers come in higher than expected all bets are likely off. The 30 year long bond closed at 4.74%, while the ten year nore closed at 4.10%.\n\nOil and Gas: Oil and energy stocks have made a strong start in the first six weeks of 2026, but were hammered on Thursday after the International Energy Agency cut its 2026 demand growth outlook. With a sector already worried about oversupply, that was all it took to bring in the sellers. Brent Crude closed Thursday at $67.65, down 2.52%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the day at $62.98, down 2.55%. Natural gas was the lone winner in the sector, rising 1.87% to close at $3.21.\n\nGold: After a stunning bounce back from the recent flash-crash, gold took a solid hit on Thursday with the rest of the market. The bullion finished the day down 3.19% at $4,920. Falling below the $ 5,000-per-ounce level, which has been considered near-term support, was driven primarily by strong U.S. labor market data. This data reduced expectations for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and triggered a cascade of selling pressure as investors cut losses. As mentioned, if the CPI data comes in below expectations you can expect more buying. Silver also closed lower Thursday down a massive 10.65% at $75.19.\n\nStory Continues\nCrypto: The Crypto markets saw heavier selling on Thursday, with Bitcoin entering a deep rout and crypto-related stocks posting sharp declines following a prolonged, multi-month selloff. Sentiment for crypto currencies as a whole continue to be downbeat, with trading volumes slowing during the fourth-quarter 2025 selloff that has extended into February. At 8 AM EST Bitcoin is trading at $67,042, while Ethereum is quoted at $1,958.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.\n\nHere are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Friday, February 13, 2026.\nUpgrades: Airbnb Inc.

      "Content": "Here Are Friday’s Top Wall Street Analyst Research Calls: Airbnb, AMD, Broadcom, CrowdStrike, Dollar Tree, Medtronic, Pinterest, Rivian, Roku, Tapestry, and More\n\nLee Jackson\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 5:01 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ABNB\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nCRWD\n\nDLTR\n\nkeypoints]\nPre-Market Stock Futures:\nFutures are trading higher after the January consumer price index report came in below expectations at 2.4%, as we head into the close of a rollercoaster week that saw a little of just about everything. After opening strongly on Thursday, stocks immediately rolled over. By the first hour mark, they were down sharply, and although stocks didn't close at the lows, they remained down for the rest of the session. With a variety of issues weighing on stocks and a big rotation out of technology after three years of double-digit gains, we could be setting up for a sizable correction. Losses were steep across the board Thursday, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 2.04% at 22,597. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at 6,832, down 1.57%, and the Dow Jones Industrials were last at 49,451, down 1.34%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was also down more than 2% to 2,615.\n\nTreasury Bonds: Yields plummeted across the Treasury yield curve as investors ran for the safety and security of guaranteed U.S. government paper. The rally was fueled by weak economic data, including rising jobless claims and declining job openings, which increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, with the solid jobs numbers earlier in the week, and if todays consumer price index numbers come in higher than expected all bets are likely off. The 30 year long bond closed at 4.74%, while the ten year nore closed at 4.10%.\n\nOil and Gas: Oil and energy stocks have made a strong start in the first six weeks of 2026, but were hammered on Thursday after the International Energy Agency cut its 2026 demand growth outlook. With a sector already worried about oversupply, that was all it took to bring in the sellers. Brent Crude closed Thursday at $67.65, down 2.52%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the day at $62.98, down 2.55%. Natural gas was the lone winner in the sector, rising 1.87% to close at $3.21.\n\nGold: After a stunning bounce back from the recent flash-crash, gold took a solid hit on Thursday with the rest of the market. The bullion finished the day down 3.19% at $4,920. Falling below the $ 5,000-per-ounce level, which has been considered near-term support, was driven primarily by strong U.S. labor market data. This data reduced expectations for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and triggered a cascade of selling pressure as investors cut losses. As mentioned, if the CPI data comes in below expectations you can expect more buying. Silver also closed lower Thursday down a massive 10.65% at $75.19.\n\nStory Continues\nCrypto: The Crypto markets saw heavier selling on Thursday, with Bitcoin entering a deep rout and crypto-related stocks posting sharp declines following a prolonged, multi-month selloff. Sentiment for crypto currencies as a whole continue to be downbeat, with trading volumes slowing during the fourth-quarter 2025 selloff that has extended into February. At 8 AM EST Bitcoin is trading at $67,042, while Ethereum is quoted at $1,958.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Here’s what you should know .\nWhy Micron Is Moving Higher Analyst Joseph Moore pointed to continued DRAM price strength and persistent supply shortages as the main reasons behind the improved outlook, Investing.com reported.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nBefore the IPO: How One Company Quietly Locked Up 500+ Iconic Character Rights\nMorgan Stanley noted that mainstream DRAM prices could double again and still remain more than 10% below current spot levels, which continue to trend upward. Contract pricing has already climbed 86% since December, and the firm says buyers who waited too long to secure inventory are now paying close to high teens ASP per GB.\n\nWhat Else Is Driving Sentiment? Micron is also preparing to announce a new investment in memory‑chip manufacturing capacity in Singapore, focused on NAND flash production, signaling that the company expects long‑term demand to remain strong, according to the report.\nSee Also: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\nWhat Do Other Analysts Think About Micron? Micron Technology has recently received favorable ratings from several analysts, with most maintaining an optimistic outlook. Similarly to Morgan Stanley’s rating, Mizuho kept its Outperform rating, increasing the target from $390 to $480 on Jan. 27.\nOther significant rating actions include William Blair initiating coverage with an Outperform rating on Jan. 22. In addition, TD Cowen and Stifel both maintained their Buy ratings on Jan. 20. TD Cowen set a new target of $450, up from $300, while Stifel raised its target from $300 to $360. This indicates a strong consensus among analysts for Micron Technology’s positive performance.\n\nRead Next:\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nThis ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "AMD Taps Ariel Kelman To Sharpen AI And Data Center Story\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 3:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nFind your next quality investment with Simply Wall St's easy and powerful screener, trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NasdaqGS:AMD) has appointed Ariel Kelman as Chief Marketing Officer.\nThe leadership change comes as AMD increases its focus on AI and data center products.\nKelman brings experience from major technology firms to sharpen AMD's global marketing efforts.\n\nFor investors watching NasdaqGS:AMD, this move comes at a time when the stock has delivered strong longer term returns, with a 1 year return of 84.2% and a 3 year return of 157.2%. The current share price of $205.94 places the company in the spotlight, as it competes for enterprise and AI workloads where clear product positioning can influence large customer decisions.\nKelman's appointment indicates that AMD is putting more emphasis on how it presents its AI and data center strategy to customers, partners and the broader market. As the company refines its offerings in these areas, investors may pay close attention to how effectively AMD communicates its product roadmap and value proposition relative to well funded competitors.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Advanced Micro Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Advanced Micro Devices.\nDoes the team leading Advanced Micro Devices have what it takes? See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.\nKelman’s arrival comes just days after AMD reported record Q4 2025 revenue of US$10.27b and net income of US$1.51b, with data center and AI products sitting at the center of the story. As AMD pushes to position itself as a credible alternative to Nvidia and Broadcom in AI infrastructure, the way it tells that story to cloud providers, enterprises and developers starts to matter almost as much as the silicon itself. Kelman’s background at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle is closely aligned with the customer set AMD is targeting, especially hyperscalers and large software vendors that buy at rack scale and care about full platform offerings rather than just chips. Reporting into Ruth Cotter and working closely with the wider executive team, he will shape brand, go to market and developer engagement at a time when AMD is guiding to Q1 2026 revenue of about US$9.8b and is rolling out new accelerator and server CPU generations. For you as an investor, this leadership change is less about a sudden shift in strategy and more about execution quality on AI and data center growth plans that are already in motion.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Kelman’s enterprise focused background supports the existing narrative that AMD is leaning into long term AI and data center demand, especially with large cloud and sovereign projects that value consistent messaging and ecosystem building.\nAt the same time, his appointment highlights execution risk that the narrative already flags, since winning share from Nvidia, Intel and custom in house chips depends not just on products but on how effectively AMD convinces hyperscalers and governments to commit to multi year deals.\nThe narrative focuses heavily on product roadmaps and long term revenue assumptions, but it does not fully account for how a revamped marketing engine could influence developer adoption, software ecosystem depth and customer mix over the next few years.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Advanced Micro Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Higher marketing and ecosystem spending, on top of already elevated AI related operating expenses, could weigh on near term margins if revenue growth from data center and AI deals does not keep pace.\n⚠️ Analysts have flagged customer concentration and inventory risks around AI hardware, and a stronger push into large accounts under Kelman increases exposure if a few big customers delay or scale back spending.\n🎁 A CMO with deep experience at Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Oracle could help AMD sharpen its pitch to enterprise buyers and developers, supporting the company’s aim to grow AI and data center revenue over time.\n🎁 Better alignment between product, marketing and developer relations may help AMD differentiate its accelerators and EPYC server chips versus Nvidia and Broadcom, supporting efforts to win rack scale and platform deals.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on whether AMD’s marketing shift shows up in concrete ways, such as deeper partnerships with major cloud providers, clearer software and developer tool messaging around its Instinct accelerators, and more consistent positioning of EPYC based platforms against Nvidia and custom chips. Commentary on earnings calls around customer engagement, funnel visibility and AI deal quality will be useful signals for how effectively Kelman and the broader team are executing. You can also track whether higher operating expenses tied to AI and marketing are matched by sustained progress in data center revenue and any changes in analyst sentiment on execution risk.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Advanced Micro Devices, head to the community page for Advanced Micro Devices to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst NVIDIA, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Alibaba Group Holding\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, February 13, 2026 at 12:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nBABAF\n\nNVDA\n\nBABA\n\nINTC\n\nFor Immediate Releases Chicago, IL &ndash; February 13, 2026 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Intel Corp. INTC, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA.\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Bitcoin vs. NVIDIA: Digital Gold or AI Giant for Long-Term Growth? For long-term investors, Bitcoin (BTC) remains a highly speculative and volatile asset facing significant selling pressure. In contrast, NVIDIA Corp. stands out as a stronger long-term investment thanks to its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects. Here&rsquo;s why &ndash;\nBitcoin Sinks as Crypto Winter Deepens Bitcoin&rsquo;s price has been declining steadily for some time, ushering in what many are calling a crypto winter. After reaching an all-time high of $127,000 in October last year, the digital asset dropped below $90,000 in December and then slipped under $80,000 in January. Following its most recent slide, Bitcoin is now down 22.9% year to date, trading around $67,000.\nSo, what triggered the downfall? Obviously, Bitcoin entered a correction after record highs, as selling pressure intensified and profit-taking weighed on the price. At the same time, institutional participation declined as interest in the so-called digital gold cooled, contributing to broader pessimism across the crypto market. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $3 billion in January this year, following withdrawals of $7 billion in November and $2 billion in December last year.\n\nGeopolitical tensions also pushed investors toward safe havens like gold and silver, while demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies softened, as they are generally viewed as riskier investments. Overall, sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, remains weak, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly in the &ldquo;extreme fear&rdquo; territory.\nNVIDIA Rides AI Boom as Revenues Soar on Easing Trade Woes NVIDIA is undoubtedly encountering stiff competition from rivals like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . as data center capital expenditure increases. Nevertheless, driven by the rapid rise of AI, NVIDIA continues to deliver impressive quarterly results. This sustained performance is largely due to the incessant demand for its cutting-edge chips, especially the latest Blackwell architecture, as well as the ever-increasing need for cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA expects global data center spending to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion annually by 2030, creating a significant opportunity for the company to expand sales of its computing hardware. U.S.-China trade complications have also settled somewhat, which is a positive development for NVIDIA. Chinese officials have approved the sale of H200 AI chips to select customers, including ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The Trump administration has already granted approval for these chips to be shipped to China.\n\nNVIDIA now anticipates fiscal fourth-quarter 2026 revenues of nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company&rsquo;s revenues surged 62% year over year and 22% quarter over quarter to $57 billion.\nBitcoin or NVIDIA: Which Is the Better Long-Term Bet? After its peak, Bitcoin&rsquo;s downfall has been fueled by profit-taking, reduced institutional interest, rising geopolitical tensions that pushed investors toward safer assets, and overall weak sentiment across the crypto market. For now, the market appears to be waiting for fresh catalysts to resume Bitcoin&rsquo;s momentum. However, one thing is clear: it is a highly speculative asset, and it faces massive selling pressure during periods of negative investor sentiment, making it less suitable for a long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, NVIDIA is a proven stock that has delivered consistent returns despite geopolitical challenges and intense competition. NVIDIA remains strongly positioned for future growth fueled by rising demand for its chips and a continued increase in data center spending. NVIDIA&rsquo;s net profit margin of 53% exceeds the industry's average of 50.1%, underscoring its strong growth and making it an attractive long-term buy (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\nNVIDIA, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "鉅亨投資雷達》勞退自提6%值得嗎？還是自己投資比較好？ 鉅亨買基金\n2026年2月12日 週四 下午10:56\n\n「我自己投資台股、美股，長期報酬不是更高嗎？」「而且勞退要等到退休才能領，資金完全被鎖住。」這是多數上班族面對勞退自提 6% 時的第一個疑問。勞退自提 6% 到底是不是一個「一定要做」的選擇？還是其實只適合某些人？\n1. 勞退基金是什麼？自提 6% 是什麼意思？\n依《勞工退休金條例》規定，雇主每月必須為勞工提繳薪資 6%，存入個人退休專戶，由勞動部勞動基金運用局統一管理，屬於個人帳戶制，就算公司倒閉也不影響這筆資金，離職後也仍會持續累積。 在雇主提繳之外，勞工可再自願提繳 1%～6% 的薪資，這就是所謂的「勞退自提」。自提金額不計入當年度薪資所得課稅，即稅前扣除，並設有最低收益保障機制，保證比定存好， 但資金須等符合法定退休條件後才能動用，且投資標的由政府統一運作。因此，自提 6% 的本質，是一種結合稅務優惠與強制儲蓄機制的退休準備工具。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n2. 什麼時候可以領？怎麼領？\n\n請領退休金課稅方式\n年滿 60 歲即可請領。年資不同，能選的領法不同：提繳年資滿 15 年以上：可選月領或一次領；未滿 15 年：原則一次領。\n「一次領」與「分期領（月領）」的差別在課稅方式不同。簡單說， 一次領是用「年資」去算免稅門檻，領越多、超過門檻的部分才會被計入所得；分期領則是每年先扣一個固定免稅額，超過的部分才算所得。\n舉例來說，假設工作 30 年退休，並選擇一次領取。免稅額度 = 19.8 萬 x 30 年 = 594 萬元。只要領取的退休金總額沒超過 594 萬元，就不須繳稅；若超過則按照級距有半額課稅或全額課稅的差別。如果選擇每月請領，免稅額度是看全年的請領總額，若不超過 85.9 萬元，則免課稅，一般來說這是不容易達到的課稅門檻。若好奇以目前薪資做自提，在退休後可以領到多少金額可以到 勞動部 網站做試算。\n3. 自提 6% vs 自己投資差在哪？\n我們直接用 2004 年至 2024 年的歷史實際資料來回測。假設每月投資 6,000 元，持續 20 年，分成兩種情境比較：第一種是每月把 6,000 元全額自提進勞退帳戶；第二種是不自提，而是把每月 6,000 元扣除當年度所得稅後的實際可投資金額，定期定額分別投資於台股、美股與美國科技股。\n從結果來看，成長型市場在這 20 年間確實累積出明顯優勢。即使在 40% 高稅率下，美國科技股約 833 萬元，仍高於勞退的 361 萬元，顯示報酬率對最終成果的影響相當關鍵。不過，隨著稅率提高，差距會逐步縮小。以台股為例，5% 稅率下最終約 738 萬元，但 40% 稅率時降至 466 萬元，與勞退 361 萬元的距離明顯拉近。 原因在於稅率越高，稅後可投入的本金越少，自提「完整投入」的優勢便開始浮現。因此，成長型資產決定長期累積速度，而稅率高低則影響起跑點。當稅率達 20% 以上時，自提的節稅優勢逐漸明顯化。\n不過，必須注意股票有崩盤並賠掉本金的風險，而勞退基金依法有「保證收益機制」 ，政府承諾就算勞退基金操盤賠得亂七八糟，最後結算給你的收益，絕對不會低於銀行定存利率。換句話說，這是一筆保證不賠本的投資。\n勞退自提與扣除稅率後投入股市的累積金額相比\n4. 我適合自提 6% 嗎？\n在討論自提之前，更重要的其實是檢視自己的理財習慣。如果單純追求長期報酬最大化，不自提、將扣稅後的資金持續投入高成長股市，理論上確實可能累積出更高的金額。但這個前提包含幾個條件：你能選到合適的標的、未來市場能延續過去的成長趨勢，以及你能在市場波動甚至大幅下跌時，仍然堅持定期定額、不恐慌贖回。此外，還有一個更現實的問題：每個月薪水發下來後，這筆原本打算投資的錢，是否真的會被確實投入，而不是被日常開銷慢慢侵蝕？\n如果你是一位具備良好投資紀律 、能長期執行計畫且能承受波動的投資人， 自行投資確實更具潛在成長空間 。但 如果對自己的執行力沒有那麼有把握 ，或擔心情緒影響決策，那麼 勞退自提的價值就在於把紀律制度化 。薪資尚未入帳即完成提撥，既節稅又強制儲蓄，讓退休準備成為一個穩定、持續的過程。\n再進一步來看， 如果你的適用稅率達 20% 以上 時，自提屬於稅前扣除，節稅效果會隨稅率提高而放大，對高稅率族群而言， 自提的優勢更加明顯 ；若 稅率較低，則節稅效益有限，建議優先建立緊急預備金與基本投資配置 ，再評估是否提高自提比例。\n鉅亨投資策略\n該不該自提 6%？依稅率與紀律做出適合的選擇\n若單純追求長期報酬最大化，自行投資高成長市場通常更具優勢；但若考量稅務效率、強制儲蓄與資產穩定性，自提 6% 仍有其制度價值。第一，先檢視自己的稅率與現金流狀況。第二，評估自身是否具備長期投資紀律與風險承受能力。第三，將自提視為退休配置的一部分，而非全部。成熟的退休規劃，不是二選一，而是在成長與穩定之間取得平衡。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nA20106\n富邦 NASDAQ-100 指數基金 (本基金之配息來源可能為本金及收益平準金)\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的;

AI 熱潮與科技股從萬能解答變成估值殺手\nAI 依舊是故事主角，但這回是以反派姿態上場。Anthropic 推出新工具後，市場開始認真計算如果 AI 能寫程式、審合約與處理資料，那些靠人力與訂閱服務生存的軟體公司，未來利潤如何支撐股價？結果美國軟體股單日蒸發 2,850 億美元市值。另一邊 SpaceX 收購 xAI，Meta 與甲骨文大舉投入重金建置 AI 基礎設施，說明資本支出仍在加碼，但股價卻因利率與估值承壓。簡單說 AI 長期前景亮眼，短期卻淪為回檔藉口，尤其是漲多的美股科技龍頭。\n3. 地緣政治與政策英日劇烈轉向、川習再度交鋒\n政治局勢完全沒有平息跡象。英國工黨幕僚長請辭，首相史塔默的人事與外交任命陷入風暴，執政穩定性遭質疑，英鎊與英國資產面臨折價風險。相反地日本眾議院選舉讓高市早苗大勝，市場解讀為日本將大開財政大門。擴張財政、國防支出與更鷹派的外交路線，對日股與日債殖利率都是強烈訊號。川普與習近平通話再度把焦點拉回貿易與台海，從大豆、石油到軍事溝通，全都牽動資金對台灣與中國資產的風險溢酬定價。中東方面，美伊在阿曼預備重啟核談，若有進展，能源供給風險可望緩和，但在那之前，油價仍對任何飛彈或談判破局高度敏感。\n4. 資產波動加密貨幣、高貴金屬與飆過頭的銅\n在利率高檔震盪與 AI 泡沫疑慮雙重壓力下，風險資產首先重挫。比特幣單日重挫約一成，白銀一度暴跌兩成，黃金也被拖下水，說明這一輪不是避險買盤，而是去槓桿化。同時前一波在中國投機資金推升下大漲的銅價，也被重新檢驗基本面。中國製造業 PMI 再度掉回預警區間，地方財政與信用風險消息不斷，讓中國需求復甦這個論點顯得底氣不足。相較之下，台灣因 AI 供應鏈帶動，上調成長預測。美日股也在震盪中維持中長期成長趨勢。市場開始用更苛刻但理性的眼光，選擇繼續追求成長或先保留現金。\n鉅亨投資策略\n在震盪中聚焦核心資產，避免盲目進場\n在利率延長賽與 AI 估值修正下，美股、日股與台股因經濟與產業結構具備成長動能，中長期持續看好，但短期需接受劇烈波動，特別是高本益比科技股的修正過程。大宗商品方面，貴金屬與工業金屬近期價格大起大落，既反映槓桿去化，也暴露出市場對全球需求的疑慮，配置上建議相對保守，以避險與分散投資為主，而非短線追價。\n鉅亨精選基金\nA36004\n安聯台灣科技基金\n申購\nB32001\n東方匯理美國鋒裕股票\n申購\nB15112\n富蘭克林坦伯頓 - 日本\n申購\n「鉅亨買基金」獨立經營管理\n本資料僅供參考，「鉅亨買基金」已盡力就可靠之資料來源提供正確之意見與消息，但無法保證該等資料之完整性。\n依金融消費者保護法最新相關規定，為提供投資人更好的投資服務，本公司施行「投資屬性評估」程序，您於鉅亨買基金網站完成「投資風險適合度」評估，本公司將依客戶屬性做商品適合度規範並至少每年請您更新一次，若未能完成屬性評估屆時將會影響您的交易。\n基金交易係以長期投資為目的，不宜期待於短期內獲取高收益。任何基金單位之價格及其收益均可能漲或跌，故不一定能取回全部之投資金額。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n外幣計價之基金，投資人須承擔取得收益分配或買回價金時轉換回新臺幣可能產生之匯率風險。若轉換當時之新臺幣兌換外幣匯率相較於原始投資日之匯率升值時，投資人將承受匯兌損失。\n各基金所採用之「公平價格調整」（或「反稀釋」）、短線交易及「價格調整機制（或「擺動定價」）」等機制，相關說明請詳各基金公開說明書。投資人應遵守基金公開說明書所列相關交易規定與限制。\n各基金經金管會核准或同意生效，惟不表示絕無風險。基金經理公司以往之經理績效不保證基金之最低投資收益；基金經理公司除盡善良管理人之注意義務外，不負責本基金之盈虧，亦不保證最低之收益，投資人申購前應詳閱投資人須知／基金公開說明書。投資人申購前應自行了解判斷。\n有關基金應負擔之費用（含分銷費用）已揭露於基金公開說明書及投資人須知，投資人可至 公開資訊觀測站 或 基金資訊觀測站 中查詢。\n由於非投資等級債券基金之信用評等未達投資等級或未經信用評等，且對利率變動的敏感度甚高，故非投資等級債券基金可能會因利率上升、市場流動性下降，或債券發行機構違約不支付本金、利息或破產而蒙受虧損。非投資等級債券基金不適合無法承擔相關風險之投資人，投資人投資以非投資等級債券基金為訴求之基金不宜占其投資組合過高之比重。部份基金或所投資之債券子基金，可能投資美國 Rule 144A 債券，該等債券屬私募性質，較可能發生流動性不足，財務訊息揭露不完整或因價格不透明導致波動性較大之風險，投資人須留意相關風險。\n基金投資於金融機構發行具損失吸收能力之債券（包括應急可轉換債券及具總損失吸收能力債券，下稱 CoCo Bond 及 TLAC 債券），當金融機構出現資本適足率低於一定水平、重大營運或破產危機時，得以契約形式或透過法定機制將債券減記面額或轉換股權，可能導致客戶部分或全部債權減記、利息取消、債權轉換股權、修改債券條件如到期日、票息、付息日、或暫停配息等變動。\n基金配息不代表基金實際報酬，且過去配息不代表未來配息；基金淨值可能因市場因素而上下波動。\n基金配息之配息率計算公式為「每單位配息金額 ÷ 除息日前一日之淨值 x100%」，含息報酬率計算為:[(除息日當月月底淨值 + 每單位配息金額) ÷ 前一月／三月／六月／一年底淨值 - 1]*100%。\n股票入息基金所稱之「入息」係指基金會使用符合其投資目標之衍生性工具，以產生額外之收入。為獲取較一致性之配息收入，除股票投資之資本利得及股息收益外，賣出短期選擇權之已實現權利金收入亦屬於基金之配息來源之一。基金之衍生性金融商品投資策略，包括賣出短期選擇權買權操作，與其他股票型基金特性不同，在市場短線大幅上漲時，可能導致基金績效落後於市場之情形。為尋求一致地於該期間每月向股東分配股息，基金之配息可能由本金支出；惟上述配息政策並不表示配息固定不變。基金投資全球股票市場，亦即基金投資人亦將承擔股票基金一般所應承擔之風險，不會因為衍生性金融商品的操作而有所降低。此外，投資人應留意衍生性工具操作與本策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n部分基金配息前未先扣除應負擔之相關費用。基金的配息可能由基金的收益或本金中支付。任何涉及由本金支出的部份，可能導致原始投資金額減損。各基金由本金支付配息之相關資料，投資人可至各投信基金公司及總代理人網站查詢。\n基金涉及投資新興市場部份，因其波動性與風險程度可能較高，且其政治與經濟情勢穩定度可能低於已開發國家，也可能使資產價值受不同程度之影響。依金管會規定：\n投信基金直接投資大陸地區有價證券僅限掛牌上市有價證券，投資人須留意中國市場特定政治、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n境外基金直接投資大陸地區證券市場之有價證券以掛牌上市有價證券及銀行間債券市場為限，且投資總金額不得超過本基金淨資產價值之百分之二十。但若該年度獲得境外基金深耕計畫認可者不在此限，比例得放寬至百分之四十。另投資人亦須留意中國市場特定政治、外匯、經濟與市場等投資風險。\n本文提及之經濟走勢預測不必然代表基金之績效，基金投資風險請詳閱基金公開說明書。\n投資人因不同時間進場，將有不同之投資績效，過去之績效亦不代表未來績效之保證。\n投資人應注意貨幣基金投資之風險包括利率風險、債券交易市場流動性不足之風險及投資無擔保公司債之風險；本基金或有因利率變動、債券交易市場流動性不足及定期存單提前解約而影響基金淨值下跌之風險，同時或有受益人大量贖回時，至延遲給付贖回價款之可能。\n風險報酬等級係依基金類型、投資區域或主要投資標的／產業，由低至高，區分為 RR1~RR5 五個風險報酬等級。RR 係計算過去五年基金淨值波動度標準差，以標準差區間予以分類等級，基金成立未滿五年，將以較短區間或適當參考標的作為評估標準。此等級分類係基於一般市場狀況反映市場價格波動風險，無法涵蓋所有風險 (如：基金計價幣別匯率風險、投資標的產業風險、信用風險、利率風險、流動性風險等)，亦不宜作為投資唯一依據，投資人應充分評估基金之投資風險。基金主要相關投資風險（如信用風險、流動性風險… 等）已揭露於基金公開說明書或投資人須知。其他相關資料(如年化標準差、Alpha、Beta 及 Sharp 值等) 可至中華民國投信投顧公會網站「 基金績效及評估指標查詢專區 」查詢。\n上述資料來源僅供投資人參考，惟相關資訊仍應以各基金公司公告為準。如有任何疏漏錯誤，本公司或關係企業與其任何董事或任何受僱人恕不負任何法律責任。\n有關基金之 ESG 資訊，投資人應於申購前詳閱基金公開說明書或投資人須知所載之基金所有特色或目標等資訊，基金 ESG 資訊可查詢 基金資訊觀測站 。\n投資人申購基金係持有基金受益憑證，而非本文提及之投資資產或標的; 投資人應留意衍生性工具 / 證券相關商品等槓桿投資策略所可能產生之投資風險 (詳見公開說明書或投資人須知)。\n鉅亨證券投資顧問股份有限公司 │ 客服信箱：cs@anuefund.com.tw\n公司地址：台北市信義區松仁路 89 號 18 樓 B 室 │ 服務專線：(02)2720-8126 │ 服務時間：09:00-17:00\n更多鉅亨報導",

      "Content": "AMD Just Announced a Huge Turnaround. Is It a Buy?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has been a great stock to own since 2025. Its stock is up around 60% since then, outperforming Nvidia over the same time frame. Up until a few days ago, AMD's stock was up over 100% during the same time frame, but it cratered after the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nIf I presented you the numbers, you may question why the sell-off occurred in the first place, as it looks like AMD has started the turnaround it told investors about months ago. Is this your buying opportunity? Or should you stay patient for a deeper decline?\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nAMD's data center sales are accelerating One thing that has held AMD back during the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is its lack of focus on AI. Unlike Nvidia, which gets around 90% of its revenue from data center sales, AMD is more evenly spread out. During Q4 2025, 52% of sales came from data center revenue, while 38% came from its client and gaming division, and another 9% came from its embedded process division (totals don't add up to 100% due to rounding errors). Because AMD isn't as leveraged to data center sales, it isn't participating as much during one of the biggest technological shifts we've ever seen with generative AI .\n\nHowever, AMD is starting to increase its data center growth rate.\nDuring Q4 2025, its data center revenue increased at a 39% year-over-year pace. That's solid acceleration from Q3 2025's 22% growth rate, and Q4 could be the quarter that we look back on as the turning point for AMD. However, this is a small growth rate compared to what management thinks it will get to. Furthermore, sales to China are starting to return now that the Trump administration is starting to allow exports there again. This will be a solid boost throughout 2026 and beyond.\nBack in November, AMD released five-year guidance regarding each of its business units. During that release, it told investors that they could expect a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the data center division and a 10% CAGR for the other two. Combined, that would lead to a 35% CAGR companywide through 2030. While AMD fell slightly short of those projections during Q4, it still did an excellent job and is showing greater progress toward meeting those goals.\n\nBut why did AMD's stock slip?\nAMD's stock was expensive entering the quarter Before the sell-off, AMD's stock was trading for nearly 40 times forward earnings; now it trades for about 31.\n\nStory Continues\nConsidering AMD's track record and relative growth rate, there was no reason for AMD's stock to be valued that high, so a pullback was due. Furthermore, rival Nvidia trades for just 24 times forward earnings despite a greater market share and a stronger growth rate. So, to call AMD's stock cheap here is a fallacy, in my opinion.\n\nStill, I think it could deliver strong growth moving forward, especially if its data center division's revenue growth accelerates toward that 60% growth figure management guided for last year. For 2026, Wall Street analysts expect 34% revenue growth, and in 2027, that figure rises to 37%. Both of those are in line with the 35% overall CAGR management expects to deliver, so the analyst community believes that AMD can deliver on its promise.\nI'm still more bullish on Nvidia than I am AMD, but I think AMD is a worthy buy at this point in time as an alternative pick in the AI space. The AI build-out is far from over, and AMD could still deliver impressive growth despite missing out on the initial stages.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Deepens AI Inference Push With Groq Deal And Rubin Platform\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 6:13 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nSSNLF\n\nMU\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nNvidia agreed to acquire Groq's AI inference chip assets for $20b, aiming to expand its position in AI deployment hardware.\nThe company introduced its new Rubin chip platform, designed around next generation memory technology for inference workloads.\nSamsung and Micron are set to supply HBM4 memory for Nvidia's new GPU platforms, signaling changes in its component supply chain.\nRecent U.S. policy signals on legacy AI chip exports to China may affect how Nvidia serves that market.\n\nNVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) enters this phase of product and deal news with a share price of $186.94 and a one year return of 38.2%. Over the past week, the stock is up 8.8%, while the year to date return sits at a 1.0% decline, reflecting some recent volatility.\nFor you as an investor, the Groq acquisition and Rubin launch are mainly about where Nvidia wants to compete as AI usage shifts toward real world applications. Memory partnerships and evolving China export rules add extra moving parts that could influence demand, pricing power, and how its product roadmap plays out, all of which are worth watching alongside the share price.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for NVIDIA by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on NVIDIA.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 4 things going right for NVIDIA that every investor should see.\nNvidia’s $20b move for Groq’s inference assets and the Rubin platform launch point to a clear push beyond training GPUs into AI-inference specific hardware. That fits with what you are seeing elsewhere in the business, from distributed inference trials with Prologis and EPRI at utility-adjacent micro data centers to heavier use of Nvidia’s Isaac and BioNeMo platforms in areas like warehouse autonomy and lab robotics. The announced use of Samsung and Micron HBM4 on upcoming GPUs ties Nvidia more tightly to key memory suppliers, which may help support Rubin and Vera Rubin ramps but could also concentrate supplier risk. On the policy side, signals that older Hopper-generation chips might see looser export treatment to China, while newer architectures stay tightly controlled, effectively segment Nvidia’s portfolio by region and performance tier. For you, the thread across these developments is that Nvidia is working to secure more of the inference stack, from edge sites to large AI factories, while juggling supply chain depth and export rules that can affect where and how quickly new products scale.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The NVIDIA Narrative The Groq acquisition, Rubin platform work and distributed inference partnerships support the narrative that Nvidia is leaning into an AI infrastructure supercycle that spans both training and inference across data centers and edge locations.\nGreater reliance on specific HBM4 suppliers and export segmentation between Blackwell or Rubin and older Hopper chips underscores narrative risks around supply chain fragility and geopolitical limits on total addressable market.\nThe focus on inference specific hardware and micro data centers, as well as physical AI in labs and factories, extends the story into use cases that are not fully captured by a training centric view of AI data center growth.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NVIDIA to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Tighter links to a handful of HBM4 suppliers may expose Nvidia to component shortages or pricing pressure if memory capacity becomes constrained or terms change.\n⚠️ Export rules that keep the latest Blackwell and Rubin chips out of China could cap growth in that market and push some large customers toward domestic or alternative accelerators from peers like AMD or in house silicon.\n🎁 The Groq asset purchase and Rubin inference focus give Nvidia more product depth against inference competitors such as AMD and custom ASIC providers, which can help support its position across the AI stack.\n🎁 Memory partnerships with Samsung and Micron, plus work on distributed inference sites, can help Nvidia stay aligned with where AI workloads are heading, from large training clusters to latency sensitive edge deployments.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, it is worth watching how quickly Nvidia integrates Groq’s technology into shipping inference products and whether Rubin based systems gain traction with cloud providers and large enterprises. The terms and volumes associated with Samsung and Micron HBM4 supply will be important signals for how smoothly future GPU ramps can proceed. On the policy side, any concrete rules around legacy Hopper exports to China, compared with continuing restrictions on newer architectures, will help clarify how much of Nvidia’s portfolio can serve that market. Together, these factors will influence how balanced Nvidia’s AI exposure is between training and inference, and how diversified its demand and supply chains remain.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NVIDIA, head to the community page for NVIDIA to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "AI Angst in US Stocks Sends Global Money Chasing Asia’s Winners\n\nWinnie Hsu\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:55 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nSSNLF\n\n^GSPC\n\n^NDX\n\nMU\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s fears of business disruption caused by artificial intelligence are turning into a blessing for Asian stocks, fueling demand for the region’s leading chipmakers that dominate the industry’s supply chain.\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen more than 12% in 2026, in contrast to losses in US benchmarks as shares were sold off on fears that AI models may threaten the business of software, legal and real estate service providers. The S&P 500 is down 0.2% for the year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 gauge has lost around 2%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMamdani’s Grocery Plan Takes Shape In Economic Policy Shift\nThe Best Tactics for Tackling Speeders\nNY Private School Startup Seeks Edge by Giving 42% Fee Discount\nNew York Faces Slippery Evening Commute as Storm Moves in Fast\nNJ Transit Service Between Trenton and New York City Resumes\nThe divergence underscores global funds’ shift of preference from AI pioneers burdened by massive spending toward hardware producers with strong pricing power, many of whom are in Asia. Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co., while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\nThe heavy presence in Asia of advanced chip manufacturers, semiconductor foundries and assemblers, which are crucial to the AI infrastructure, is a key reason behind the region’s resilience during the recent rout on Wall Street. Micron Technology Inc.’s latest comments on memory chip supply tightness and Nvidia Corp.’s on sustainable spending have reinforced such a perception.\n\nIn a sign of growing foreign demand, Samsung Electronics saw its biggest overseas buying Thursday, sending its shares up 6.4%. They rose again on Friday. Meanwhile, global investors also notched their third-largest weekly purchase in Taiwanese stocks in a holiday-shortened week.\nKioxia Holdings Corp.’s shares surged 15% on Friday after soaring AI demand helped the Japanese memory chipmaker deliver a better-than-anticipated results outlook.\nThat’s as the Nasdaq 100 Index fell 4.6% and shed about $1.5 trillion in market value over the past 10 sessions, hit by a selloff in software names and other stocks deemed at risk from new AI tools.\n\nStory Continues\n“Some of the scares in the US are also good news in Asia, particularly when thinking about what infrastructure is really needed to harness agentic AI,” Stephanie Aliaga, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “What markets are really beginning to price in is this ChatGPT moment for AI agents.”\n\nMajor Asian chipmakers’ outsize weighting in local equities markets further amplifies their impact on stock moves.\nTSMC alone is approaching a weighting of 45% in the island’s benchmark Taiex index, three times its level a decade ago. South Korea’s Kospi has become a near duopoly, with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix Inc. together making up nearly 40%.\nWhile the so-called AI Scare Trade has also hurt US real estate services stocks and insurance brokers, there was less damage in Asia due to some of the local companies’ weaker response to cutting-edge technologies.\nThe Topix insurance sub-index has risen 6.2% since Feb. 3, with its real estate counterpart surging 15%.\n“Old school wins the day so far,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. “It’s protecting them from the AI disruption selloff because these industries are more entrenched in Japan and less open to disruption so far.”\nAs a result, the correlations between Asian and US equities based on weekly returns have slid to 0.43, the weakest level since June 2022, Bloomberg-compiled data show.\nTo be sure, Asia wasn’t entirely insulated from the global turmoil. Despite accounting for a small portion of the region’s stock markets, shares of software firms including Hong Kong-listed Kingdee International Software Group Co. and Indian tech services companies including Infosys Ltd. slumped along with their US peers during the recent sell-off.\n\nBut for now, Asian stocks are expected to continue their outperformance, thanks to the local companies’ different roles in the AI ecosystem, cheaper valuations and stronger earnings growth.\n“What we are investing in are the AI enablers such as chip manufacturers,” said Elfreda Jonker, client portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management. “One of our big positions is TSMC, which we continue to like. All AI roads lead to TSMC.”\n--With assistance from Masaki Kondo, Gabrielle Ng and Anthony Stephens.\n(Updates with Kioxia earnings in 7th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUPS’s Missteps Have Made the Company’s Road Ahead Less Certain\nDrug Cartels Are Shifting Their Money Laundering to Crypto.

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 5:42 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nGot some idle money you're ready to put to work for a while? Is there $1,000 you have available (or any amount, really) that you'd like to turn into something more? That's easier said than done right now. Too many stocks have demonstrated a bit too much vulnerability of late. Another wave of weakness feels possible.\n\nNot every name is uncomfortably risky here, however. Even if the market does get upended again, a few stocks are apt to hold up well enough and then enjoy more than their fair share of any recovery. Here's a rundown of three of these names.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nQualcomm Qualcomm 's (NASDAQ: QCOM) 23% share price pullback from its early January peak makes enough superficial sense. Not only has this been a tough period for most of the technology sector , but this company has clearly conceded that a lack of enough memory chips to sell is holding it back. But as Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon plainly said when the company posted its fiscal first-quarter results and Q2 guidance earlier this month, the matter is purely one of supply -- demand for its high-performance processors remains robust.\n\nHere's the thing: Right or wrong, memory makers have a habit of over-responding. Once they do the same with this cycle this time around -- and they will soon enough -- Qualcomm can begin making more shipments. The bears have simply priced in too much pessimism here.\nRemitly PayPal 's dominance of the online payment space is in no immediate jeopardy. It would be naïve, however, to pretend other contenders can't penetrate this market and put up some strong growth numbers once in it. Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) is one of these others.\nIn simplest terms, Remitly makes it easy to transfer U.S. dollars to another country, allowing its app's users to clear all the logistical hurdles with just a few simple steps. It serves both consumers and businesses.\nAnd business is good. The company facilitated the transfer of $19.5 billion during the third quarter of last year, up 35% year over year, generating $419.5 million in revenue for itself. Of that amount, $61.2 million was converted into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), up 29% from the year-ago comparison. Analysts are looking for the same pace of growth at least through 2028, too, although given how easy it makes this otherwise-complicated process, it's likely to maintain this rate of growth for well beyond that.\n\nStory Continues\nYes, its steep valuation is a big reason this stock's been halved since February of last year. It's also 50% below analysts' consensus price target of $20.25, though, and all nine analysts covering this ticker agree that it's a strong buy at this time.\nThe Trade Desk Finally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the many technology stocks that were driven lower as part of the sector's sweeping sell-off of late. But the market threw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. This digital advertising optimization platform is needed regardless of the economic backdrop or changing business landscape.\nAnalysts expect this reliably profitable company's revenue to grow another 16% this year, in fact, following what's projected to be top-line growth of 18% for all of last year. Moreover, priced at only about 12 times this year's anticipated per-share earnings of $2.09, The Trade Desk stock is deep into bargain territory. The market's just forgotten how necessary this company is.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $492,937 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $52,460 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $429,385 !*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 9, 2026\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "Content": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nGeoffrey Seiler\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:57 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market is continuing to boom, and this is still a great place to look to invest. Let's look at two AI stocks that investors can buy now and hold for the next decade.\nundefined\nBroadcom One of the most exciting AI stocks to own right now for the long term is undoubtedly Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The AI infrastructure market is booming with no signs of let-up in sight. At the same time, data center networking is becoming more important as AI chip clusters grow, while there has also been a shift toward companies looking to create their own custom AI chips to save costs.\nAs the inference market eventually outpaces training over the coming decade, AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) should begin to take more share away from graphics processing units (GPUs ), which are currently the primary chips used to power AI workloads.\n\nThis is all great news for Broadcom. The company is a top player in data center networking, where its Tomahawk Ethernet switch is a leading solution within AI data centers. Meanwhile, the company helped Alphabet create its highly successful tensor processing units (TPUs), which look poised to become a huge growth driver as Alphabet aggressively builds out its AI infrastructure and starts letting customers use its chips for their AI workloads, as well. Anthropic has already placed a $21 billion TPU order to be delivered this year for use within Google Cloud. Meanwhile, other companies, including OpenAI, are also working with Broadcom to develop their own custom AI chips.\nBetween networking and custom AI chips, Broadcom has one of the biggest growth opportunities in the AI space over the next decade.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another huge beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company is the leading manufacturer of chips in the world, and it has a near monopoly on making advanced chips. As competitors have struggled with achieving high yields for advanced chips, TSMC has become the go-to partner for chip designers and is working in lock step with them to increase capacity to meet surging demand. Best of all, it benefits from both GPU and AI ASIC growth.\nTSMC's position in the industry has also given it strong pricing power, which has helped it boost its gross margins. According to reports, it has already informed customers of a four-year price hike schedule. Between boosting its capacity and price increase, TSMC looks poised to be a long-term winner in the AI infrastructure space.\n\nStory Continues\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Morgan Stanley tweaks Micron stock price target as pressure builds\n\nMoz Farooque\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 3:33 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nSSNLF\n\nMicron ( MU ) stock just got another major nod of approval from Wall Street , and the timing is telling.\nShares of the popular memory maker are up 10% over the past week, and Morgan Stanley sees even more upside, raising its price target to $450 from $350 while reiterating an overweight rating.\nThe bullishness stems from the fact that memory pricing power continues to go from strength to strength.\n\nMicron and other memory makers have been on a killer run as AI infrastructure spending rises at an exponential pace. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) has become mission-critical for AI accelerators, and supply has struggled to keep pace.\nMicron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra discussed AI’s insatiable demand for memory during a recent CNBC interview at Davos.\nAnd AI’s relentless appetite for memory isn’t slowing down anytime soon, per Seeking Alpha and according to Samsung Electronics CTO Song Jai-hyuk .\nSpeaking at Semicon Korea 2026, he said that AI-linked infrastructure demand should remain strong through at least 2027, with the tech titan ramping up mass production of its sixth-generation HBM4 chips.\n“ Memory and packaging are no longer supporting roles ,” said Clark Tseng of Semi, a semiconductor research and analysis outfit. “They are now critical to how fast AI infrastructure can scale .”\n\nAdditionally, Lenovo said memory costs jumped 40% to 50% in the past quarter and could double in the current one.\nThat’s exactly the setup that’s pushing Micron stock to record highs, up 44% year to date , despite broader market sluggishness.\nThe ongoing AI infrastructure buildout is expanding rapidly, positioning Micron well for the remainder of the year.\nWhere Wall Street sees Micron stock heading next Micron is trading at $410.34 (as of Feb. 12, 2026).\nMorgan Stanley: $450 (+9.7%) UBS: $450 (+9.7%) Deutsche Bank: $500 (+21.9%) Wells Fargo: $410 (-0.1%) Citigroup: $385 (-6.2%)\nMorgan Stanley sees pricing power getting stronger, not weaker Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore is making the case that, despite the eye-opening run in DRAM over the past year, the cycle is only tightening.\n“As much as happened in the last 12 months in DRAM, we remain excited for what's ahead,” he wrote. The key element to consider at this point is supply, or rather, the lack of it.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nThe numbers back up the bullishness:\nDDR5 spot pricing up 30% YTD\nSpot prices are 130% above January contract levels (up 86% from December).\nMainstream pricing could double again while still sitting at more than 10% below spot.\nASPs could approach the high-teens per GB.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s tremendous pricing leverage.\nMoreover, Moore now expects Micron to earn as much as $52 per share in 2026 , speahreaded by HBM demand tied to Nvidia . “ HBM is certainly a key part of the story here ,” he noted, but added that DDR5 pricing alone is now “ a much more attractive market right now .”\nMicron is smaller in HBM, but the gap is narrowing AI accelerators have been gobbling up HBM, and businesses that can efficiently ship product at scale continue to win over investor confidence.\nAt this point, though, the scoreboard in the memory space is clear.\nIn DRAM, SK hynix leads the charge with 33.2% market share , followed by Samsung at 32.6% , with Micron at 25.7% .\nIn HBM, which is the critical part for AI GPUs, the gap is wider.\nRelated: Top analyst revamps Apple stock price target\nSK hynix currently dominates with a 53% market share , Samsung holds 35% , and Micron trails at 11% .\n\nIn NAND, Samsung leads at 32.3% , SK hynix follows at 19.3% .\nSo clearly, SK hynix is the stand-out company that’s dominating the HBM scene and will likely capture the bulk of Nvidia’s early Rubin volume. Also, Samsung is moving aggressively to ramp HBM4 shipments and close the gap.\nAt the same time, despite Micron being a much smaller player in HBM, it’s ramping HBM4 and benefiting from the broader memory crunch.\nIt’s important to note that Micron is already in high-volume production on HBM4, having sold out its 2026 supply.\nMicron stock crushes the S&P 500 across every major time frame YTD: Micron +43.77% versus S&P 500 +1.40%\n1-year: Micron +336.16% versus S&P 500 +14.38%\n3-year: Micron +585.96% versus S&P 500 +69.70%\n5-year: Micron +374.49% versus S&P 500 +77.24%\n10-year: Micron +4,134.67% versus S&P 500 +279.50%\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nRelated: JPMorgan doubles down on S&P 500 target for one key reason\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 12, 2026, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "The Next Semiconductor Winner Might Not Be Nvidia\n\nSushree Mohanty\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\n^IXIC\n\nFor much of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia (NVDA) has stood at the top, dominating data center GPUs and being the first choice for anything AI. However, the next phase of the AI race may not just be for a single winner. As demand shifts from GPUs to full-stack computing solutions such as CPUs, AI accelerators, and software ecosystems, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is emerging as a serious challenger.\n\nAMD entered 2025 with strong momentum and exited the year strengthening its case that it could be the next semiconductor winner. AMD stock has gained 85% in the past year, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) gain of 15%. So far this year, AMD stock is down roughly 4%.\nMore News from Barchart 4,500 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Today\nA $100 Million Reason to Buy Intel Stock Now\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February 2026\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nLet's find out whether AMD stock is a good buy now on the dip.\nData Center and AI Represent AMD’s Growth Engine Valued at $348 billion, AMD designs high-performance processors and graphics chips used in data centers, personal computers, gaming consoles, and AI systems. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 34% year-over-year (YOY) to $10.3 billion, driven by record sales of EPYC server processors, Ryzen CPUs, and Instinct accelerators. Diluted earnings rose 40% YOY to $1.53 per share. The data center segment became the company's key growth engine. Q4 data center revenue climbed 39% YOY to $5.4 billion, driven by robust EPYC server processor demand and accelerated MI350 series GPU shipments. The adoption of fifth-generation EPYC Turin CPUs surged, “accounting for more than half of the total server revenue,” while fourth-generation EPYC processors remained in high demand.\n\nNotably, hyperscaler demand remained high, with over 230 new AMD-powered instances launched throughout the quarter. Over the course of the year, hyperscalers added more than 500 AMD-based instances, bringing the overall number of EPYC cloud instances up by more than 50% to nearly 1,600. Looking ahead, AMD anticipates continued high server demand as hyperscalers increase infrastructure to support AI and enterprises modernize data centers for emerging AI workflows. Additionally, the ramp of MI350 series shipments and additional MI308 sales to customers in China contributed to the growth of the data center AI business.\nOn the software side, AMD expanded the ROCm ecosystem, allowing for speedier deployment and better performance across a wider range of workloads. Management noted that customer interest in AMD's next-generation MI400 series and Helios platform is growing. Last quarter, AMD announced a multi-generational partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs. The company believes the launch of MI400 and Helios represents a major inflection point and expects data center revenue to grow more than 60% annually over the next three to five years, with AI revenue scaling to tens of billions of dollars annually by 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking ahead, AMD is also developing the MI500 series using the cDNA6 architecture and advanced two-nanometer process technology with HBM4e memory. AMD plans to release MI500 in 2027, aiming for another significant boost in AI performance for next-generation multimodal models.\nAMD’s Other Segments Are Going Equally Strong AMD’s Client segment revenue rose 34% to a record $3.1 billion, driven by strong demand across multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. Meanwhile, Gaming revenue increased 50% YOY to $843 million, supported by strong demand for Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs and higher channel sellout during the holiday period. AMD also launched FSR4 Redstone, its latest AI-powered upscaling technology.\nThe Embedded segment's revenue increased 3% YOY to $950 million as demand strengthened in the test and measurement and aerospace markets. AMD closed $17 billion in embedded design wins in 2025, bringing the total since acquiring Xilinx to more than $50 billion. The firm ended the quarter with a sturdy balance sheet holding $10.6 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor the full year, revenue grew 34% to $34.6 billion, with more than $7.6 billion added from data center and client revenue growth. Gross margin reached 52%, and EPS rose 26% YOY to $4.17, even as the company continued investing heavily in AI and data center initiatives.\n2026 and Beyond Could Be Exceptional AMD expects strong growth to continue into 2026, driven by increased adoption of EPYC CPUs, expanding Instinct deployments, continued client share gains, and a return to growth in embedded markets. For Q1 2026, the company expects revenue of around $9.8 billion (plus or minus $300 million), representing roughly 32% YOY growth at the midpoint.\nLooking further ahead, AMD sees revenue growth above a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three to five years, expanding operating margins, and annual EPS exceeding $20 within its strategic timeframe. Analysts forecast AMD’s earnings to increase by 60% in 2026, followed by another 58% in 2027. AMD stock is valued at 37.9 times forward earnings, compared to its historical average of 93 times.\n\nAMD’s expanding portfolio, from Helios AI infrastructure in the cloud to Ryzen processors powering edge and PC AI, positions the company to capture growth across the entire AI compute stack, making it a strong contender to Nvidia.\nIs AMD Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell Now? Overall, the consensus for AMD stock has changed from a “Moderate Buy” one month ago to a “Strong Buy” consensus now. Of the 45 analysts covering AMD, 31 rate it a “Strong Buy,” while two recommend a “Moderate Buy,” and 12 recommend a “Hold.” Based on the average price target of $288.54, analysts see potential upside of about 40% over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the high target of $380 implies a potential price increase of 84% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in February\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 1:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been hit hard in recent weeks. The market is growing skeptical about AI spending, but the reality is that it's still going strong. We've received news of what capital expenditures look like for many of the AI hyperscalers during 2026, and these record-setting numbers indicate one thing: The AI buildout is far from over.\n\nThis makes me bullish on a specific group of stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Both of these companies are poised to benefit from the massive amount of money being spent this year, and look like excellent buys right now as a result.\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\nHow much is being spent on AI? The three companies I want to focus on for capital expenditures spending amounts are Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms . All three of these companies are AI hyperscalers and are spending a ton on computing equipment for internal use and to rent out to customers via their cloud computing service.\nFor 2026, Amazon expects to spend $200 billion, Alphabet up to $185 billion, and Meta up to $135 billion. Combined, that's over $500 billion in capital expenditures. That's not including Microsoft , which is a major spender as well.\n\nThere are also several other companies spending billions of dollars on computing equipment that aren't even included on this list, so the reality is that AI spending is going to be as big as ever. While investors may be concerned that companies are spending too much on AI and should be concerned, that doesn't mean you should avoid investing in companies that are making money from AI right now, like Nvidia and Broadcom. Both of these are major computing unit suppliers and will make a boatload of money this year.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been the go-to AI computing units since the AI boom began in 2023. While Nvidia is seeing more challengers, it's still the top contender thanks to its full technology stack setup that allows end users to purchase everything they need from Nvidia.\n\nAnother company to watch is Broadcom. Instead of offering a GPU that can tackle a wide range of workloads, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to design a chip specifically meant for its needs. Alphabet and Broadcom have already collaborated to produce the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a wildly popular design. As Alphabet's capital expenditures soar, so will its TPU orders, boosting Broadcom's sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThere are also several other hyperscalers who are clients of Broadcom's, and each of them also expects to ramp up consumption of custom AI chips in an effort to diversify away from Nvidia's products.\nEach of these compaines is slated to benefit, but they're also just great buys in general right now.\n\nThese stocks rarely trade at these cheap valuations Wall Street analysts expect both Broadcom and Nvidia to deliver 52% revenue growth this fiscal year. That clearly indicates that the AI boom is far from over, yet the market isn't pricing in this success.\nNvidia is the cheaper of the two, trading for 24 times forward earnings. Broadcom is more expensive at 32 times forward earnings, but its success is far less predictable than Nvidia's due to its concentration with a handful of clients using its chip designs. I still think each of these AI stocks is worth investing in, although I do prefer Nvidia a tad more.\n\nWith the massive amount of money being spent on AI hardware from these three major players, Nvidia and Broadcom's stock should be rising, not falling. But that opposite is going on, so investors should use this opportunity to load up on two of the best growth stocks we've seen in years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The actual amount of these exclusions will have a significant impact on the company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin.\n\nPrepared Materials and Conference Call Information\nArista's executives will discuss the fourth quarter and year end 2025 financial results on a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time today.

Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect us can be found in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can locate these reports through our website at https://investors.arista.com/ and on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/ . All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and accompanying table contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions, including the recognition of direct excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, as well as non-recurring adjustments to our tax provision resulting from the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBB Act\"). Effective the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, the Company updated its methodology for calculating the income tax effect of Non-GAAP adjustments. Previously, the Company’s calculation excluded all tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, consisting of both direct excess tax benefits and other discrete indirect effects. Under the updated methodology, the Company continues to exclude direct excess tax benefits but no longer excludes the discrete indirect effects of such awards. Management believes this change better aligns with industry practice and provides a more meaningful view of the Company’s effective tax rate. All prior period Non-GAAP results presented in this release have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nThe company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Data Center Switching, Andrew Lerner et al., 31 March 2025\nGartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure, Mike Leibovitz et al., 25 June 2025\nGARTNER and MAGIC QUADRANT are trademarks of Gartner, Inc. and its affiliates.\nGartner does not endorse any company, vendor, product or service depicted in its publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.\nGartner publications consist of the opinions of Gartner’s business and technology insights organization and should not be construed as statements of fact.

      "Content": "1 Brilliant AI Stock That You Should Buy Hand Over Fist in 2026\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 12:49 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBroadcom 's (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock rallied nearly 600% over the past five years. Most of that growth was driven by its aggressive acquisitions and its brisk sales of AI chips. Let's see why it could still be one of the best stocks to buy in 2026 as the AI market continues to expand.\nWhy is Broadcom growing so rapidly? From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended last November), Broadcom's revenue grew at a 22% CAGR from $23.9 billion to $63.9 billion. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) rose at a 26% CAGR from $13.6 billion to $43.0 billion.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nTwo catalysts fueled that expansion. First, it expanded its infrastructure software business through major acquisitions -- including its 2023 takeover of the cloud giant VMware -- to reduce its dependence on the cyclical semiconductor market. Second, it sold more networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips to data centers to support the latest AI applications.\n\nUnlike Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which sells general-purpose data center GPUs for processing AI tasks, Broadcom sells customized AI accelerators for hyperscalers. In fiscal 2025, Broadcom's AI chip revenue surged 65% to $20 billion. That accounted for 31% of its top line and offset the slower growth of its non-AI chip and infrastructure software businesses.\nWhy will Broadcom continue to grow? Broadcom aims to generate annualized AI chip revenues of $60 billion to $90 billion by the end of fiscal 2027, with most of that growth coming from just three of its hyperscale customers. That rosy outlook suggests the world's largest cloud companies are eagerly developing their own custom AI accelerators with Broadcom to curb their long-term dependence on Nvidia.\nBroadcom will also likely continue to acquire more companies to fortify its AI chipmaking and infrastructure software businesses. Its non-AI chip businesses -- which sell a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio-frequency chips for other markets -- should also benefit from the long-term expansion of the mobile, automotive, and industrial sectors.\nFrom fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at CAGRs of 38% and 36%, as those tailwinds kick in. With an enterprise value of $1.65 trillion, it still looks reasonably valued at 26 times this year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\nStory Continues\nSo if you're looking for a balanced AI stock with plenty of upside potential, Broadcom checks all the right boxes. It might not attract as much attention as Nvidia, but it's also one of the best producers of picks and shovels for the ongoing AI gold rush.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $429,385 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,165,045 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 913 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Analog Devices Governance Move Puts Special Meeting Rights In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 9:17 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ADI\n\nNever miss an important update on your stock portfolio and cut through the noise. Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\nAnalog Devices (NasdaqGS:ADI) has responded to a shareholder proposal seeking changes to special meeting rights.\nThe company is urging investors to vote against the proposal and is pointing to prior changes that lowered the threshold for calling special meetings.\nManagement is highlighting its broader governance approach, including a stated focus on shareholder rights and board accountability.\n\nAnalog Devices, known for its analog and mixed signal semiconductors used in industrial, automotive and communications applications, is putting governance firmly in focus with this response. For you as an investor, special meeting rights touch on how quickly shareholders can react when material issues arise. This can be relevant alongside fundamentals like balance sheet strength or end market exposure.\nBy stressing both the existing special meeting terms and its stance on accountability, Analog Devices is signaling how it wants to manage shareholder influence over major decisions. As you weigh NasdaqGS:ADI, this type of governance disclosure can sit alongside product mix, customer concentration and capital allocation policies when you think about overall risk and oversight quality.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Analog Devices by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Analog Devices.\nSee which insiders are buying and buying and selling Analog Devices following this latest news.\nThis governance update is really about where the balance of power sits between ADI’s board and its shareholders. By urging investors to vote against a further expansion of special meeting rights, the company is arguing that the current 25% threshold already offers meaningful influence while limiting the risk that a small group can force company specific events onto the calendar. For you, this is a signal about how ADI prefers to manage activist pressure and board accountability at a time when interest in the stock has been reinforced by recent earnings beats and positive analyst sentiment. It also shapes how long term holders might think about stability, especially when management is already committing capital to areas such as buybacks and growth investments in data centers, autos and industrial markets.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Analog Devices Narrative The company’s emphasis on “long term shareholder value” and governance discipline aligns with the narrative that ADI is positioning for autos, AI and automation, where consistent execution and board oversight can support multi year product and R&D plans.\nCalls from some shareholders to loosen special meeting rights could challenge that narrative if they signal impatience with capital allocation choices or with how quickly ADI is pursuing opportunities in areas such as AI infrastructure.\nThe investor presentation on special meeting rights adds a governance dimension that is not explicitly covered in the narrative, which mainly focuses on end markets, earnings potential and capital deployment rather than how shareholder rights might influence those plans.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Analog Devices to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ A shareholder base that is pushing for easier special meetings may be a sign of rising activism risk, which can lead to distractions for management or pressure for short term moves that do not match your own time horizon.\n⚠️ If some investors view ADI’s stance as too protective of the board, it could create governance related criticism, especially when peers such as Texas Instruments, NXP or Microchip adopt different approaches to shareholder rights.\n🎁 The existing 25% threshold is lower than the prior 80% requirement and may help ADI maintain operational focus while still giving a sizeable group of shareholders the ability to act when they see material issues.\n🎁 Clear communication that the board is focused on accountability and long term value can support confidence for investors who are already watching ADI’s earnings momentum and analyst interest in its data center and auto exposure.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward You will want to see how the vote on the proposal turns out and whether support for the shareholder resolution is high enough to suggest persistent governance pressure. Watch for any follow up from large holders or governance advisory firms, as their reaction can shape future proposals or board engagement. It is also worth tracking how ADI’s board decisions on capital returns, acquisitions and R&D align with this message about long term value, especially compared with peers in the analog and mixed signal space that face similar investor activism.\n\nTo stay informed on how the latest news affects the investment narrative for Analog Devices, visit the community page for Analog Devices to keep up with the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

O’Malley wrote that ADI has “the most leverage to Industrial exposure,” making it the most attractive way to position for an upturn.\nBy contrast, Barclays initiated Microchip at Equal Weight, noting the company is exposed to networking and memory demand from AI data-center buildouts but faces challenges including “a difficult spot from a leverage perspective” and “share loss in low end MCUs.”\nThe bank assigned the stock an $80 price target.\nBarclays also started coverage of ON Semiconductor at Equal Weight with a $75 target, citing upside from rising data-center dollar content in the move to 800-volt architectures.\n\nHowever, O’Malley said the stock cannot “break out” without a broader recovery in auto demand, which “remains mum for foreseeable future.”\nBarclays added that each company in the group faces at least one industry-specific challenge, reinforcing its preference for ADI’s mix of industrial leverage and balance-sheet strength.\nRelated articles\nBarclays upgrades Analog Devices as industrial recovery takes shape\nThese 2 stocks are best positioned to benefit from higher uranium prices: analyst\n5 reasons why Jefferies thinks Meta’s pullback is a buying opportunity\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Soft Earnings Are Actually Better Than They Appear\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:44 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nThe most recent earnings report from QUALCOMM Incorporated ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) was disappointing for shareholders. However, our analysis suggests that the soft headline numbers are getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nA Closer Look At QUALCOMM's Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nQUALCOMM has an accrual ratio of -0.29 for the year to December 2025. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$13b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$5.37b. Over the last year, QUALCOMM's free cash flow remained steady.\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\nOur Take On QUALCOMM's Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, QUALCOMM produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that QUALCOMM's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of QUALCOMM's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

      "Content": "Cadence ChipStack AI Super Agent Puts EDA Role In Focus\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, February 12, 2026 at 2:12 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CDNS\n\nNVDA\n\nQCOM\n\nTrack your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.\nCadence Design Systems (NasdaqGS:CDNS) has introduced the ChipStack AI Super Agent, described as a first-of-its-kind agentic AI solution for front-end silicon design and verification.\nThe platform uses multiple virtual engineers powered by Cadence’s existing EDA tools, with the company indicating potential productivity gains of up to tenfold in chip design workflows.\nEarly adoption by Nvidia and Qualcomm, along with Cadence’s investment in robotics AI, points to growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to semiconductor and intelligent device development.\n\nFor you as an investor, this update sits at the intersection of electronic design automation and accelerating AI chip development. Cadence Design Systems, through its core EDA software and AI driven workflows, plays a role in how complex processors and systems on chip move from concept to tape out. As chipmakers look for ways to manage design complexity and time to market, tools that automate front-end design and verification are increasingly central to their operations.\nThe ChipStack AI Super Agent and the company’s robotics AI focus may influence how Cadence positions itself with customers building next generation AI centric hardware and intelligent devices. As you evaluate NasdaqGS:CDNS, it can be useful to watch how widely ChipStack is deployed, how it fits alongside competing design flows, and how customers integrate these AI agents into their broader engineering processes.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Cadence Design Systems by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Cadence Design Systems.\nWe've flagged 0 risks for Cadence Design Systems. See which could impact your investment.\nThis launch pushes Cadence further into AI-powered automation for chip design, an area where it already has a deep presence through tools like Verisium, Cerebrus and the JedAI platform. By coordinating multiple virtual engineers across coding, test creation, regression, debugging and auto fixes, ChipStack is aimed directly at the cost and time bottlenecks that large chipmakers care about most. Early use by Nvidia, Qualcomm and others is a signal that key customers see value in tighter AI integration across their existing Cadence workflows rather than standalone tools. For you, the key question is whether ChipStack can move from early access to broad, paid deployment across those accounts and beyond, which could influence how sticky Cadence’s platform is versus rivals such as Synopsys and Siemens EDA.\n\nStory Continues\nHow This Fits Into The Cadence Design Systems Narrative The ChipStack launch lines up with the narrative that AI-driven design tools and partnerships with large chipmakers can support future revenue growth, especially as customers look for higher productivity in advanced AI and high-performance-compute designs.\nIf ChipStack requires heavier R&D and cloud infrastructure spending to support complex agentic workflows at scale, it could challenge expectations for steadily rising profit margins over time.\nThe narrative focuses on AI design tools and IP demand but gives less attention to Cadence’s push into robotics AI and Physical AI via investments such as Trener Robotics, which could add another leg to the long-term story if it gains traction.\n\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Cadence Design Systems to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider Higher dependence on large AI-chip customers such as Nvidia and Qualcomm could increase Cadence’s exposure if those relationships weaken or design cycles slow.\nCompetitive responses from Synopsys, Siemens EDA or newer AI-tool vendors could pressure pricing or limit how much ChipStack adoption Cadence ultimately achieves.\nChipStack aims to deliver up to 10x productivity gains in front-end design and verification, which could strengthen Cadence’s value proposition and support premium pricing for its broader EDA stack.\nEarly use across several leading chip designers and a reported multi billion dollar backlog suggest Cadence is already embedded in critical AI and data-center projects, giving it a platform to cross sell new AI agents.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, keep an eye on how often management references ChipStack wins in future updates, especially any comments on seat growth, usage-based revenues or expansion within existing top customers. Watch for signs of competitive products from other EDA vendors and whether customers are standardising on agent-based design flows or treating them as optional add ons. You might also track how Cadence links ChipStack with newer areas such as robotics AI, since success there would show that its AI tools can extend beyond classic semiconductor design into a broader intelligent-device market.\n\nTo ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Cadence Design Systems, head to the community page for Cadence Design Systems to never miss an update on the top community narratives.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "Content": "Intel AI Push Deepens With SambaNova Bet And New GPU Chief\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 5:08 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSANS.PVT\n\nQCOM\n\nGet insights on thousands of stocks from the global community of over 7 million individual investors at Simply Wall St.\nIntel (NasdaqGS:INTC) is committing at least US$100 million to AI chip startup SambaNova Systems.\nThe company has also appointed former Qualcomm executive Eric Demers as its new Chief GPU Architect.\nBoth moves reflect a shift in how Intel is approaching AI chips and GPU development.\n\nIntel, known for its x86 processors and data center products, is increasingly tied to demand for AI computing across cloud, enterprise, and edge use cases. The SambaNova investment adds capital to a specialist in AI hardware and software, at a time when dedicated AI chips have become an important focus for chipmakers.\nFor you as an investor, these steps highlight where Intel is trying to compete more directly in AI accelerators and GPUs, rather than relying only on its existing CPU franchise. The combination of external investment and a new GPU leader may lead to product and partnership changes that you can monitor over upcoming product cycles.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Intel by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Intel.\n📰 Beyond the headline: 2 risks and 2 things going right for Intel that every investor should see.\nFor Intel, putting at least US$100 million into SambaNova and hiring Eric Demers looks like a move to close gaps in AI accelerators and high performance GPUs, where Nvidia and AMD currently set the pace. SambaNova gives Intel closer access to AI-specific chip design and software stacks, while Demers brings experience from another large chipmaker in building competitive GPU roadmaps. Together, these steps point to Intel trying to serve hyperscalers that are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers, not just with CPUs and foundry capacity but with a fuller portfolio of accelerators. The flip side is execution risk. Intel is already investing heavily in new manufacturing nodes and materials, and layering a deeper AI chip push on top of that raises questions about focus, timelines and returns on capital. If Intel can coordinate its CPU, GPU, custom AI silicon and foundry efforts around what large cloud and enterprise buyers actually want, this news could represent a meaningful evolution of its data center business model. If that coordination does not materialize, it could simply add complexity without a clear payoff.\n\nHow This Fits Into The Intel Narrative The SambaNova investment and Demers hire align with the narrative that Intel is refocusing on AI workloads and foundry partnerships, potentially supporting the idea that a clearer product roadmap can improve competitiveness and customer trust.\nThese moves also test the concern that organizational complexity and slow AI adaptation can hold Intel back, because successfully integrating an external startup and a senior GPU leader requires faster decision making and tighter execution than in the past.\nThe specific exposure to AI accelerators and software centric AI platforms through SambaNova is not fully captured in a general AI and foundry narrative, so investors may want to factor in how this partnership could change Intel’s mix of revenue and R&D priorities over time.\n\nStory Continues\nKnowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story. Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Intel to help decide what it's worth to you.\nThe Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider ⚠️ Intel already faces execution challenges in manufacturing and product rollouts, so adding another AI partnership and a new GPU leader could stretch management focus and prolong the time it takes for these efforts to show up in results.\n⚠️ Competition from Nvidia, AMD and specialized AI chip players means that even with SambaNova and a high profile GPU architect, Intel still has to convince hyperscalers that its AI stack is differentiated enough to win design slots.\n🎁 If Intel can integrate SambaNova’s AI hardware and software know-how with its CPU and foundry offerings, it could offer more complete solutions for cloud and enterprise buyers looking to standardize on fewer suppliers.\n🎁 Analysts have highlighted both risks and rewards for Intel, and this AI focused move relates directly to the potential reward that comes from better aligning Intel’s products with the long term growth in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nWhat To Watch Going Forward From here, you may want to track whether Intel and SambaNova announce concrete co-developed products, reference customers or design wins with large cloud providers and enterprises. Progress updates from Intel on how Demers is shaping its GPU roadmap, and how those GPUs are positioned against Nvidia and AMD in AI training and inference, will also matter. On the financial side, watch for any management commentary on how AI accelerators, GPUs and related software contribute to the data center segment, and whether these investments change Intel’s capital allocation priorities.

NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc.&rsquo;s MU .\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\nBull of the Day: A recent pullback in Gold.com stock may be short-lived as gold prices have rebounded to new record highs of over $5,000 per ounce, as shown below, following a sharp pullback to around $4,400 per ounce earlier in the month.\nAmid an unprecedented commodity price boom for various precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s stock has been one of the market&rsquo;s top performers in 2026 so far, soaring nearly +90% through the first two months of the year and recently hitting a 52-week high of $66 a share.\nOffering a fully integrated alternative assets platform, sentiment continues to build for Gold.com&rsquo;s outlook after reporting impressive results for its fiscal second quarter last Thursday and attracting positive attention from analysts in the process.\n\nHeadquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and formerly known as A-Mark Precious Metals, Gold.com provides an array of precious metals, including minted gold bars, silver, platinum, and palladium, along with copper bullion and numismatic coins to wholesale and retail consumers.\nStrong Q2 Results & Strategic Expansion\nEnforcing the narrative that Gold.com is executing well, Q2 sales spiked 136% year over year to a quarterly record of $6.47 billion from $2.74 billion in the comparative quarter. Net income came in at $11.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, a 55% increase from EPS of $0.55 in the prior year quarter.\nDrawing analysts' attention is that Gold.com crushed consensus sales and EPS expectations of $2.92 billion and $0.70 per share by 121.2% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAttributing to Gold.com&rsquo;s compelling expansion is its international growth, with its wholly owned subsidiary, LPM Group Limited, being based in Hong Kong and becoming one of the largest precious metals dealers in Asia.\nLPM also has an expanding presence in Singapore, with it noteworthy that Gold.com acquired Monex Deposit Company in January, an established U.S. precious metal dealer that should significantly expand its product offerings and customer base as well. Furthermore, management emphasized ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions and optimize costs to maintain long-term margin expansion.\nFavorable EPS Revisions & Attractive P/E Valuation\nSupportive of more upside in GOLD shares is that Gold.com&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 EPS estimates have spiked over 50% in the last 60 days, with FY27 EPS revisions still up nearly 12%.\n\nStory Continues\nWithin the last week, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 13% despite a 5% decline in FY27 EPS revisions. Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS is now expected to soar 63% this year and is projected rise another 15% in FY27 to $4.09.\nMaking Gold.com&rsquo;s EPS outlook more attractive is that GOLD still trades at a reasonable 22X forward earnings multiple, offering a slight discount to the benchmark S&P 500 amid heavy market interest.\n\nConclusion\nAs a beneficiary of sky-high gold prices and other booming precious metals, Gold.com&rsquo;s rebranding couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, cleverly changing its ticker symbol from ARMK to GOLD in December.\nBut as the company has stated, &ldquo;This transition represents far more than a name change. It encapsulates our corporate identity as the most trusted and globally recognized precious metals platform, and our commitment to delivering value for our customers, partners, and, of course, our shareholders.&rdquo;\nWith now appearing to be an ideal time to invest in Gold.com stock based on a pleasant trend of positive EPS revisions, its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is further supported by an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nBear of the Day: Qualcomm shares are down 5% since its fiscal first quarter report last Wednesday, and have now fallen nearly 20% year to date.\nEven though Qualcomm exceeded quarterly expectations, its guidance came in below Wall Street's estimates, attributed to the well-documented memory chip shortage.\nDespite record Q1 sales, a cautious tone surrounding the shortage from Qualcomm&rsquo;s management has weighed on investor sentiment and analysts' outlook for the stock.\nTriggering a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm is experiencing an unfavorable trend of declining EPS revisions, and lands the Bear of the Day.\n\nThe Global Memory Chip Shortage\nQualcomm has emphasized that memory chip shortages are hurting smartphone demand, which directly impacts its core handset processor business.\nThe company has warned that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are pulling back on orders due to memory constraints, which is expected to weigh on sales in the near term.\nWhile investors love upstream suppliers during a shortage that can raise prices, such as storage and flash-chip memory providers, like Sandisk and Western Digital, they typically avoid downstream component providers in the supply chain, like Qualcomm, which designs processors and modems that go into the finished devices.\nIn other words, upstream suppliers sell the scarce resource; downstream suppliers depend on it.\n\nWeak Guidance & Declining EPS Revisions\nQualcomm&rsquo;s Q2 revenue guidance of $10.2&ndash;$11 billion missed the consensus estimates of $11.1 billion. More concerning, Q2 EPS guidance of $2.45&ndash;$2.65 was well under the Zacks Consensus of $2.85.\nSuggesting more downside risk ahead is that over the last 30 days, Qualcomm's fiscal 2026 and FY27 EPS estimates have now dropped over 7%, following a noticeable decline in the last week.\nBottom Line\nIronically, skyrocketing demand for AI data centers has diverted memory supply away from smartphones, causing OEM production delays and forcing Qualcomm to lower its guidance.\nAlthough Qualcomm has AI data center endeavors of its own, smartphone production is still its biggest revenue source. Until there is a resolution to the memory chip shortage, it wouldn't be surprising if there is more volatility ahead for Qualcomm stock.\n\nAdditional content: Micron Is Quietly Outperforming NVIDIA &mdash; Don&rsquo;t Ignore It\nWith the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corp. has delivered impressive returns, soaring more than 1,000% over the past five years. Yet, in the past year, Micron Technology, Inc .&rsquo;s shares outpaced NVIDIA&rsquo;s (+307% vs +43.1%). Let&rsquo;s see why Micron is emerging as the new go-to AI investment, even amid NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong bullish momentum.\nNVIDIA&rsquo;s Strong Demand and Growth Outlook Keep Investors Bullish\n\nNVIDIA remains the center of attraction among investors, and for good reasons. Consistently, NVIDIA delivered encouraging quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street expectations even in the face of several geopolitical hurdles. This is because demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) remains strong.\nSomewhat easing of the U.S.-China trade tensions and incessant increase in data center spending, in all likelihood, could boost NVIDIA&rsquo;s sales. NVIDIA remains optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to hit nearly $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com. This would be more than the company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter 2026 revenues of $57 billion, and if achieved, it will surely raise the stock further (read more: NVIDIA vs. Palantir: One AI Stock is a Clear Buy Right Now).\n\nMicron Emerges as a Key AI Beneficiary on Strong HBM Demand\nWhile NVIDIA continues to command the spotlight, another chipmaker, Micron, has steadily gained investors&rsquo; attention, driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips amid the rapid expansion of AI.\nThe demand for Micron&rsquo;s HBM chips has surged as data center operators and hyperscalers ramp up AI infrastructure investments. At the same time, constrained HBM supply amid high demand is likely to enhance Micron&rsquo;s profit margin and support its growth trajectory. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also added that tight HBM supply is expected to persist as demand remains strong, creating a demand-supply imbalance that could push prices higher and benefit Micron in the near future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Micron is quite optimistic about its financial performance, with management expecting fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, more than the $13.64 billion reported in first-quarter fiscal 2026, according to investors.micron.com. The company also expects net income to increase further.\nWhy Micron Is a Solid Buy Right Now\nMicron is gaining investors&rsquo; attention as AI-driven HBM demand and tight supply bolster its growth outlook. Micron&rsquo;s net profit margin of 28.2%, more than the Computer - Integrated Systems industry's 14.3%, also clearly suggests strong growth potential.\nMoreover, Micron offers an attractive buying opportunity at a reasonable valuation. Micron&rsquo;s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.66 is well below the industry&rsquo;s average of 18.18.\n\nTherefore, from an investment standpoint, Micron is too promising to ignore right now. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.9 for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 204.3% year over year.\nCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock to Buy Now With $150\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nWed, February 11, 2026 at 6:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nInvestors looking to buy into AI stocks, particularly semiconductor stocks, should look beyond the biggest names like Nvidia or Broadcom . Additionally, the surge in memory chipmaker's values amid the push for more AI compute power has left those stocks looking fairly expensive.\nBut investors with just $150 can still buy a great AI chipmaker. Despite a disappointing outlook for the next year, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) looks like a no-brainer buy for patient investors who can withstand a bit of financial pressure in the near term.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nAI creates near-term headwinds but long-term tailwinds The growing demand for artificial intelligence compute has created an interesting challenge for Qualcomm.\nThe chipmaker generates the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of wireless handsets. That stems from both licensing its intellectual property for 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G chipsets as well as making its own baseband chips and mobile processors. Unfortunately, the smartphone industry is facing pressure due to the rising cost of memory chips, a key component. As a result, Qualcomm warned that smartphone volume will decline this year, pushing its revenue lower.\n\nMemory chips have climbed in price because AI accelerator chips and GPUs are packaged together with lots of memory to facilitate faster and more effective large language model training and inference. But supply hasn't caught up with demand. Memory chipmaker Micron expects supply to remain tight through the end of calendar 2026. As a result, Qualcomm could see pressure on its revenue through the middle of its fiscal 2027 as memory chip supply slowly ramps up. Management's second-quarter outlook calls for a 3.5% year-over-year decline in total revenue.\nBut Qualcomm has worked to diversify beyond smartphones. Its automotive segment continues to grow quickly and should remain unaffected by the memory chip shortage. Likewise, its Internet of Things (IoT) business should keep growing over the next few years. Qualcomm is also pushing into the data center chip business with a pair of chips designed for AI inference. That could be a meaningful growth driver over the next few years, partially offsetting the pressure on the handset business.\n\nIn the long run, however, Qualcomm looks like a great opportunity. As AI inference moves from something done exclusively on data center servers to something that could be run on devices, Qualcomm is in a great position to capitalize long term. Its Snapdragon mobile processors are some of the best high-end chips for smartphones. On-device AI could increase demand for more high-end devices, meaning more devices with Qualcomm's chips inside.\n\nStory Continues\nImportantly, management expects the setback in smartphone production to be a temporary headwind. It maintained its 2029 revenue outlook, which means the long-term potential for the stock remains intact. While the stock certainly deserved a haircut in price after the news, the market may be giving patient investors a great opportunity right now. At less than $140 per share as of this writing, investors are paying just 12 times forward earnings expectations. And those earnings should show meaningful growth in the years to come after resetting this year amid the smartphone headwind.\n\nShould you buy stock in Qualcomm right now? Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

Davidson分析師Gil Luria出具報告指出，我們認為市場過度反應，股價已經跌過頭。近幾個月來，OpenAI的商業模式已有顯著進步，「OpenAI似乎已經修正策略失誤，並重新聚焦於核心的前沿模型（frontier models），也開始考慮安插廣告的「變現」模式，「我們認為重整後的OpenAI可望重返Google最大挑戰者的位置」。CNBC報導，OpenAI執行長奧特曼（Sam Altman）上周五告知員工和投資人，ChatGPT的月成長率已重返逾10%。他並透露本周將推出升級版的AI聊天機器人模型。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n●Alphabet漲0.45%，收在324.32美元。據外媒報導，Google母公司Alphabet周一成功發行公司債籌資200億美元，規模超出原訂的150億美元。Alphabet此次發債吸引超過1000億美元認購，成為史上企業債發行需求最強勁的交易之一，顯示對於科技巨頭舉債發展AI，市場目前仍然樂意買單。分析師表示，這可能帶動今年企業債發行規模創下歷史新高。\n\n●Waters Corp周一崩跌13.94%，收在328.14美元，在醫療保健成分股中跌幅最大。該實驗室設備製造商第一季獲利預測不如市場預期，此外，投資人也關注去年收購的Becton Dickinson表現疲弱。\n●Hims & Hers Health暴跌16%，為連跌第七天。諾和諾德（Novo Nordisk）以侵犯專利權為由向這家遠距醫療（telehealth）公司提起告訴。此前，在美國食藥管理局（FDA）強烈反對下，Hims & Hers Health在推出僅48小時後後又立即下架一款售價僅49美元的諾和諾德減肥藥Wegovy仿製藥。",

      "Content": "《美股》消息面：華許若就任 川普喊GDP飆15%；美發警示 油價彈升 時報資訊\n2026年2月9日 週一 下午6:34\n\nCL=F\n\n62.7 ( 0.22% )\n【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】消息面：\n●美國交通部海事局周一向航經荷姆茲海峽的商船發布新指引，建議「懸掛美國國旗的商船在不影響航行安全下，應盡可能遠離伊朗領海，以降低遭攔查或扣押風險」，「如果伊朗軍隊登船，船員不應以武力抵抗」。海事局表示，伊朗部隊最近一次對通過荷莫茲海峽與阿曼灣的船隻登船檢查，是發生在2月3日。儘管伊朗最高外交官員上周五表示，由阿曼居中斡旋的美伊核談判取得樂觀進展，但美國總統川普卻在同一日加大對伊朗的施壓。川普簽署了行政命令，落實他日前釋出的威脅，也就是對於任何「直接或間接」採購伊朗商品的國家加徵25%進口關稅。\n廣告\n廣告\n\n●Fox Business報導，美國總統川普表示，如果他提名的人選華許（Kevin Warsh）獲准就任聯準會主席，並有效發揮能力、履行其職責，那麼美國經濟成長率可望達到15%，甚至可能更高。川普並表示，華許是他第一個任期時的聯準會主席第二人選，而最終他選擇了鮑爾「真是一大錯誤」。美國2026年GDP成長率預估為2.4%，過去50年的平均年度成長率約為2.8%。自1950年代以來，美國經濟成長長率超過15%的情況，寥寥無幾。\n\n●周一紐約尾盤美元指數跌0.8%，報96.81，投資人等待本周公布的非農就業和通膨等重要經濟數據，以及日本政府可能出手干預的預期給日圓帶來支撐。\n●周一布蘭特期油上漲99美分或1.5%，收於每桶69.04美元。美國WTI期油漲81美分或1.3%，收在每桶64.36美元。美國海事局對懸掛美國國旗行經荷姆茲海峽的商船發布警示，加劇對中東緊張升溫的擔憂。\n●受美元走軟激勵，周一金價收復每盎司5000美元大關。黃金現貨價格上漲1.9%，報每盎司5056.21美元，延續上周五大漲4%的升勢。4月期金收漲2%，報每盎司5079.40美元。繼上周五強彈近10%後，周一白銀亦大漲6.3%，報每盎司82.86美元。",
