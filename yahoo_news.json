      "Title": "Is Nvidia Set to Help Joby Aviation Become the Tesla of the Skies?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/34f6a3ab-0e5e-3c8f-9ed7-9c15f100c270/is-nvidia-set-to-help-joby.html",
      "Content": "In late 2025, the news that Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY) and Nvidia were teaming up to develop an autonomous flight capability hit the market by surprise. Given that Joby is pursuing a vertically integrated strategy (designing, manufacturing, owning, and operating its own aircraft as a transportation company) in the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) market, the parallel with Tesla' s robotaxi rollout is obvious. Is it set to make Joby the undisputed eVTOL champion?\n\nThe collaboration will involve Joby using Nvidia's computing power via its new IGX Thor Platform, which is under development alongside Joby's Superpilot autonomous flight technology. It's an interesting move that highlights the differences in approaches among Joby, Archer Aviation , and the eVTOL company no one talks about: Boeing's Wisk.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nEach company has its own strategy. Archer aims to be an eVTOL manufacturer and will sell its aircraft to others. Joby and Wisk, on the other hand, want to run transportation services. The key difference is that Joby, like Archer, is starting with piloted aircraft, while Wisk is focused only on autonomous planes.\n\nHaving pilots means that Joby and Archer are significantly ahead in the certification process. Still, if Wisk's autonomous eVTOL gets certified later, they're highly likely to substantially undercut Joby's airtaxis, in the same way that Tesla's robotaxis are likely to be heavily price-competitive with conventional taxis.\n\nThe potential threat from Wisk is somewhat mitigated by Joby's ongoing development with Superpilot and, more recently, the Nvidia collaboration. Joby plans to develop autonomous functions (mission management, radar processing, etc.) that will act as a digital copilot to assist a human pilot.\n\nHowever, Joby plans to use Nvidia's technology platform to continue developing Superpilot so it can ultimately \"pursue certifiable autonomy for near-term defense and long-term civil applications as the Federal Aviation Administration advances the capabilities of national airspace,\" according to a Joby press release.\n\nThe company's plan to develop autonomous eVTOLs for the military in the near term makes sense, as it could establish and test its technology ahead of civil adoption. Moreover, the plan to use Superpilot as a digital copilot on civil airtaxis will give the company substantial flight-hour data to improve it ahead of a potential launch. Again, the analogy with Tesla works, as the EV company has billions of miles of data on its full-self-driving (FSD) software from Tesla drivers.\n\nBy working with Nvidia, Joby is reducing the risk that Wisk will overtake it in the autonomous market. The company could have piloted airtaxis in service, and possibly even autonomous ones for the military, before Wisk's civil autonomous eVTOL is certified.\n\nJoby's first-mover advantage could prove telling in funding rounds and establishing technology and trust in the marketplace. Consequently, it's an attractive stock for investors looking for eVTOL exposure.",

      "Content": "There have only been four companies to reach a $3 trillion market cap or greater. But as the stock market rises, the $3 trillion level will eventually be breached by many more companies. In fact, I think three of them will each reach that level over the next three years.\n\nThe three that I've got my eye on are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . All of these companies are within striking distance, and each looks like a worthy investment option now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nSome of these companies have further to go than others. Amazon is already a $2.4 trillion company, so projecting that it will rise to a market cap of $3 trillion in three years isn't really that bold a call. It only needs to manage a growth rate of 8% over the next three years to get there. If that's all, the faster it grows, the more likely it will be a disappointment for most investors. I think Amazon has a much better growth case than that, but we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom have much further to go. Taiwan Semiconductor is a $1.72 trillion company, while Broadcom tops the sales at $1.47 trillion. It will take a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% and 27%, respectively, for each to rise to a $3 trillion cap three years from now.\n\nThat's no easy task, but if each can deliver that rate of return, they will make for no-brainer buys right now. But are these growth rates feasible?\n\nAmazon is probably the easiest company to make a case for. Although it only needs to deliver an 8% growth rate to reach this level, it has managed to grow its revenue above double digits for the past four years.\n\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nI have no doubt that it will continue that trend over the next few years, and it could grow at an even faster rate thanks to the acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing service that powers traditional and AI workloads, posted revenue growth of 24% in the fourth quarter (Q4) -- the best in 13 quarters. This is a clear sign that Amazon's business is thriving, and with AWS having a much better operating margin than the rest of the business, its outsized growth will have an even greater effect on profits. Amazon is a lock to reach a $3 trillion market cap in three years and should beat the market along the way.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key part of the AI build-out, as its chip foundries manufacture a large chunk of the logic chips utilized in AI devices. Management expects huge growth from AI over the next few years, with AI chip revenue rising at nearly a 60% CAGR. However, that's not a companywide growth rate, as other companies utilize its foundry services outside of AI. From 2024 to 2029, management expects a CAGR of nearly 25% companywide, easily surpassing the 20% return threshold needed to rise to a $3 trillion company three years from now.\n\nLast is Broadcom. It has the longest way to go but will likely grow at the fastest rate. Although it does several other things, its biggest growth driver is its custom AI chips, which it designs in a partnership with AI hyperscalers. By designing a chip around a specific workload, Broadcom can achieve better results at a lower price point but at the cost of flexibility. These are massively growing in popularity, and Broadcom expects to double its AI segment revenue year over year during Q1 2026. As more hyperscalers launch their custom chip design with Broadcom, their growth rate will continue to be strong. This will drive Broadcom to become a $3 trillion company quickly, and investors shouldn't miss out on this stock .",

      "Content": "Walmart WMT shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and brick-and-mortar retail peers but also Amazon AMZN and many members of the Magnificent 7 group.\n\nWith the company set to report quarterly results on Thursday, February 19th, it will be interesting to see whether the stock can maintain its momentum after the results.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart shares (green line, up +20.2%) relative to the Mag 7 group (blue line, down -5.4%), the S&P 500 index (red line, down -0.4%), Amazon (purple line, down -13.9%) and Target shares (orange line in the chart, up +18.2%). Target has also been added to the chart, though the company will be reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, March 3 rd .\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe should keep in mind, however, that the performance pecking order shifts when we move the starting point of this chart back by 12 months, as shown below. Target has enjoyed an impressive run this year, but the retailer’s one-year performance is comparable to Amazon’s.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart’s share price outperformance reflects the market’s collective optimism about the company’s large and growing digital business, which has enabled it to tap new growth opportunities such as third-party fulfillment and advertising.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce business complements its core merchandise, which remains heavily indexed toward groceries, other essentials, and must-have necessities. This orientation towards essentials, coupled with Walmart’s well-earned reputation for low prices, provides the company’s results with a high degree of cyclical stability.\n\nWe should note, however, that a big contributing factor to Walmart’s stock market momentum over the last few years reflects its ability to gain market share among higher-income households. Driving those gains has been a combination of higher-income households trading down to Walmart in response to inflation and the ease of using the company’s e-commerce capabilities. Walmart has consistently flagged market-share gains across all income categories, particularly in the high-income category, and we expect further gains on that front in this quarterly report as well.\n\nResults likely benefited from pulled-forward demand in anticipation of tariffs, particularly in some categories like electronics. Growth in e-commerce and steadily lower losses in that business, coupled with gains from third-party fulfillment and advertising, are some of the other areas that will benefit results this quarter.\n\nThe e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable and will likely become a significant contributor to earnings in 2026 and beyond. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15% of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, management noted earlier in the year that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales were from domestically sourced products, which gave them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart’s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60% of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix.\n\nManagement has reiterated its commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart’s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.73 in EPS on $189.9 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +5.2%, respectively. Estimates have been stable, though they have nudged up a hair since the quarter began.\n\nIn terms of same-store sales, the expectation is of U.S. comps (ex fuel) of +4.17%, which will compare to a +4.4% gain in the preceding quarter (vs. expectations of +4.02%), and a +4.9% gain in the year-earlier period (vs. expectations of +4.36%). A positive general merchandise read will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2025 Q4 earnings season scorecard , we now have results from 13 of the 31 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 13 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported Q4 results belong mostly to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have several restaurant companies on deck to report this week as well.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 13 retailers that have reported are up +6.3% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues, with 46.2% beating EPS estimates and 76.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the EPS beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. In fact, the Q4 EPS beats percentage at 46.2% matches the lowest beats percentage for this group of Retail sector companies in the preceding 20-quarter period. Unlike EPS beats, revenue beats are far more numerous and tracking above historical averages.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 13 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +5.9% on +13.6% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart now a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player, thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThrough Friday, February 13 th , we have seen Q4 results from 371 S&P 500 members, or 74.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS estimates and 72.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have more than 400 companies on deck to report results this week, including 56 index members. The week’s lineup includes a blend of operators such as Palo Alto Networks, DoorDash, Etsy, and Booking Holdings, as well as traditional bellwethers such as Toll Brothers, Deere, and others.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the growth rates for these 371 index members with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages for this group companies relative to what we had seen from them in other recent periods.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison chart below puts the Q4 net margins for the 371 companies that have reported in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for the current period (2026 Q1) have risen modestly in recent days, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2026 Q1 estimates have increased modestly for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of January, including Tech, Industrials, Retail, Utilities, and Business Services. On the negative side, Q1 estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Energy, Medical, and Consumer Discretionary sectors.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Analyzing the Evolving Earnings Picture: What Should Investors Know?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "After beginning the year on a strong note, shares of e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have recently fallen off a cliff.\n\nLet's dig into why Amazon investors are running for the hills. Is now a good opportunity to buy the dip in Amazon, or is the stock turning into a falling knife ?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nOver the last three years, Amazon has accelerated its capital expenditures (capex) significantly. Rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is causing Amazon to invest heavily across the infrastructure value chain -- from building data centers, designing its own custom silicon, and complementing these chips with GPUs from Nvidia .\n\nAmazon reported earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2025 on Feb. 5. Prior to the report, Wall Street was expecting management to guide for around $150 billion in capex this year. With this in mind, investors had sticker shock when the company's plans for $200 billion capex were revealed.\n\nThe trends in the chart sum up why Wall Street is getting skittish over Amazon. The inverse correlation between rising infrastructure spend and decelerating cash flow generation is a major concern for investors.\n\nWhere investors may be missing the mark is looking at Amazon's revenue growth. Over the last year, sales and operating profits from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division have consistently risen. In other words, Amazon's high-margin cloud business is experiencing both accelerating sales and profit margins.\n\nThis dynamic is allowing the company to allocate capital across so many different AI-related projects. Building its own data centers and custom chips, alongside its strategic investment in Anthropic, is helping Amazon vertically integrate its AI operations.\n\nIn the long run, this should significantly reduce costs and lead to stronger earnings growth. When you think about it this way, Amazon's playbook to double down on its AI infrastructure roadmap looks savvy. While rising capex may be a near-term dent for free cash flow, the long-term gains are hard to deny.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is hovering near its lowest level throughout the entire AI revolution.\n\nConsidering sales from AWS are beginning to reaccelerate and are complemented by robust profit margins, I am confident that Amazon's decision to continue investing in AI infrastructure makes sense strategically. While I understand investor concerns around execution risk, I think Amazon has already done a fine job of mitigating these worries.\n\nTo me, the sell-off in Amazon stock is overdone, and the stock looks like a no-brainer right now. Against this backdrop, I'd say Amazon isn't just a good stock to buy -- it's a great one for long-term investors to buy and hold.",

      "Content": "It has been just under a year since digital storage giant Western Digital spun off flash storage specialist Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) , and the latter has turned into one of the hottest stocks on the market since its separation.\n\nShares of the company -- which specializes in NAND flash storage solutions for smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, automotive applications, wearable devices, and data centers -- have shot up a stunning 1,400% since the spin-off. Investors may now be wondering whether it is worth holding this semiconductor stock after its red-hot rally.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nLet's take a closer look at Sandisk's long-term prospects and check whether it can deliver more upside over the next three years.\n\nWe have already seen that Sandisk's storage solutions are used across multiple applications. The edge devices market, which includes PCs and smartphones, is its largest business segment, accounting for 55% of its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on Jan. 2, 2026). Sandisk's revenue from this segment shot up by 63% from the year-ago period, to just under $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company pointed out that the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the PC and smartphone markets is a major catalyst for this segment. That's not surprising, as generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs are equipped with higher storage to support local AI tasks. Importantly, shipments of these devices are poised to accelerate at a healthy pace over the next three years.\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that generative AI smartphone shipments could jump to 912 million units in 2028, up from 234 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, generative AI PC shipments are predicted to jump to 138 million units in 2028, up from just over 24 million units in 2024. So, Sandisk should continue to witness healthy demand from these end markets in the long run.\n\nAt the same time, investors should note the strong growth Sandisk is witnessing in data centers, where demand for fast flash storage solutions such as solid-state drives (SSDs) is increasing. SSDs offer much faster data transfer speeds and greater energy efficiency than hard-disk drives (HDDs). Specifically, SSDs can be a hundred times faster than HDDs, enabling instant data transfer at higher bandwidths.\n\nOf course, HDDs are significantly cheaper than SSDs. However, the shortage of HDDs is pushing AI infrastructure companies toward SSDs. SSDs can also reduce the total operating costs of data centers thanks to their energy efficiency and faster data transfer rates.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see the data center business moving the needle in a bigger way for Sandisk over the next three years, especially considering the massive investments in this space . The company reported a 76% year-over-year increase in data center revenue in the previous quarter to $440 million. This impressive growth seems sustainable, as Sandisk's storage solutions have been qualified for use by a second hyperscaler customer, and it is on track to bring additional hyperscalers on board.\n\nSandisk notes that it will begin recognizing revenue from its new hyperscaler customers in the next few quarters. All this explains why analysts are expecting a sharp spike in Sandisk's top line. Specifically, its revenue is expected to more than double in the current fiscal year from $7.36 billion in the previous one, followed by another significant jump in the next fiscal year.\n\nSandisk isn't just enjoying healthy top-line growth. The supply-constrained nature of the memory market is also pushing prices higher. According to market research firm TrendForce, NAND flash memory prices could jump by 55% to 60% in the ongoing quarter, up from the earlier estimate of 33% to 38%.\n\nWhat's more, NAND flash memory is expected to remain in short supply through 2028, driven by a jump of almost 3x in demand by that time as compared to 2024 levels. This should pave the way for a robust jump in Sandisk's earnings, following a projected 1,220% increase in the current one to $39.45 per share. As the following chart indicates, Sandisk's earnings could almost double in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that the flash storage market is likely to sustain solid growth beyond next year, Sandisk could see a big jump in its earnings after the next couple of years. But even if we assume a conservative 25% increase in its bottom line in fiscal 2028, its earnings could jump to just over $95 per share within the next three years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings by the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25 points toward a stock price of $2,375, which is over 4x Sandisk's current stock price. So this AI stock has the potential to become a multibagger over the next three years. That's why investors should consider buying it hand over fist, as it is trading at just 15 times forward earnings right now.",

Still, the company rocketed higher on the back of a blog post from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , published on Tuesday, which touted the benefits of superconductor technology for AI data centers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft's General Manager of Global Infrastructure Marketing, Alistair Speirs, published a blog post touting the benefits of high-temperature superconductors (HTS). In the post, Speirs noted that Microsoft is investigating HTS technology for use in its data centers.\n\nOf course, as the company's name indicates, American Superconductor Corporation manufactures superconductors for advanced power transmission and military applications for the U.S. Navy.\n\nSuperconductors are metal alloys that can conduct electricity with little or no resistance. Compared with conventional power delivery systems such as copper or aluminum wires, superconductors can move greater amounts of power in a smaller form factor. Thus, if superconductors were used in for power delivery to modern AI data centers, Speirs claims this would greatly relieve pressure on utilities and power delivery systems which are now faced with overwhelming electricity demand.\n\nWhile Speirs' blog post didn't specify if and to what extent Microsoft is deploying this technology, or whether it was working with any utilities to do so, he did write, \"Only recently the economics and manufacturing aspects of this technology made it viable at Microsoft's cloud scale.\"\n\nTo be clear, Microsoft didn't mention American Superconductor in its blog post. However, if superconductors are widely adopted to meet the energy-hungry needs of AI data centers, and if AMSC executes to deliver the technology to AI data center customers, the stock could have significant upside.\n\nLast quarter, American Superconductor beat expectations on revenue and adjusted earnings per share, with revenue up 20% year-over-year to $74.5 million. While shares don't look \"cheap\" at 32 times next year's earnings estimates, American Superconductor is profitable today, which isn't always the case with next-generation technology companies. And if superconductors become widely adopted in AI data centers in the future, those earnings, as well as the stock price, could have significant upside.",

But the growing hyperscaler debt pile has raised concerns about their lack of investor protections compared to other bonds.\n\n\"What stands ‌out is what’s missing,\" said Julia Khandoshko, ⁠the CEO of Cyprus-based broker Mind Money. \"Once a big name gets covenant-light terms through, others will try the same.\"\n\n\"Naturally, that creates a second-market problem, where the next buyer has fewer 'rules' ⁠to rely on, while prices will swing more on rates, mood, and liquidity,\" she added.\n\nInvestment-grade borrowers with strong credit profiles typically include fewer covenants in debt agreements than their junk-rated counterparts.\n\nYet most include basic investor guardrails, especially a standard change-in-control covenant protecting ​investors ​in the event of M&A or another change in ownership. ​Alphabet's bonds do not carry these protections, noted ‌Anthony Canales, head of global research at New York-based Covenant Review.\n\nThe five major AI hyperscalers - Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft , and Oracle - issued $121 billion in U.S. corporate bonds last year, according to a January report by BofA Securities.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment, while Oracle, Meta and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nOracle's $25 billion note offering on February 2, and Meta's $30 billion bond offering in October, similarly lacked change-in-control and other basic covenants, Canales noted.\n\n\"In most IG ‌covenant packages you would expect to see a change-in-control covenant,\" Canales ​said. \"But these are huge companies where the investors don't believe there's great ​risk they'll need these protections.\"\n\nFuture tech issuers, especially ​smaller and lower-rated companies, could run into obstacles if they attempt to model their covenants ‌after Alphabet, he added.\n\nNew debt issuance in 2026 ​from the five major hyperscalers ​could reach more than $300 billion as their spending needs around AI buildout increase, BofA Securities analyst Tom Curcurro wrote in a January 12 report.\n\n\"This massive AI infrastructure buildout requires so much capex from the hyperscalers ​that they want to reduce the technical ‌impact on their bonds,\" said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst at the New York-based research firm CreditSights, ​noting the benefits to issuers from flexible covenant structures.\n\n\"I wouldn’t expect there to be any real ​covenant protections.\"\n\n(Reporting by Matt Tracy in WashingtonEditing by Nick Zieminski)",

      "Content": "Astera Labs ALAB shares have plunged 30.8% since it reported fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday. The decline was due to a slight decrease in non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2025, which dropped 70 basis points sequentially to 75.7% compared to the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a higher mix of hardware sales.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins also fell 150 basis points sequentially to 40.2%, driven by a $16 million increase in operating expenses due to the expansion of the R&D organization, including the aiXscale acquisition.\n\nALAB’s shares have also plunged 33.6% in the trailing six-month period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 10.3% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of 20.3% over the same time frame. The underperformance can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition in the PCIe retimers market.\n\nHowever, the company is benefiting from its robust and diversified product portfolio to address the growing demands of AI infrastructure and connectivity solutions, as well as its expanding partner base. It benefits from strong demand for its PCIe solutions, which have also been a major growth driver.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ product portfolio, including Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus, has been a key catalyst. In the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB started increasing production of its Scorpio X-Series lead platform.\n\nThe company also expanded the Smart Fabric Switch roadmap with hyperscaler partners, adding new features to meet the needs of next-generation scale-up networking. Early interest from customers is pushing more investment into the quickly growing merchant scale-up switching market, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, ALAB expanded its product portfolio with custom NVLink Fusion connectivity solutions designed with hyperscaler partners to optimize heterogeneous AI infrastructure performance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce cost across diverse next-generation AI workloads.\n\nALAB’s expanding portfolio underpins the company’s expectation that its served addressable market opportunity will expand by more than 10x over the next five years to reach $25 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by its copper-based product families, including Aries and Taurus signal conditioning solutions, Scorpio AI fabric switches, Leo CXL Memory Controllers, and custom solutions for scale-up connectivity.\n\nAster Lab is benefiting from strong demand for its Aries, Taurus, and Scorpio product families, all of which are expected to drive growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAstera Labs expects first-quarter 2026 revenues between $286 million and $297 million. Earnings are expected to be between 53 cents and 54 cents per share for the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at 52 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 57.58%.\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc. Quote\n\nDespite an expanding portfolio and strong partner base, ALAB is facing stiff competition from other industry players like Marvell Technology MRVL, Credo Technology CRDO, and Broadcom AVGO in the connectivity space.\n\nMarvell Technology is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. Marvell Technology recently completed its acquisition of Celestial AI, strengthening its scale-up optical connectivity capabilities for large-scale AI deployments.\n\nCredo Technology is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market with a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. Credo Technology’s shares have rallied 3.8% in the trailing six-month period.\n\nBroadcom is expanding its footprint in the PCIe retimers market by developing advanced solutions that enhance signal quality and extend the reach of PCIe connections in high-speed data environments. Broadcom shares have surged 50.3% in the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAstera Labs’ stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 17.67X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.51X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAstera Labs’ strong fundamentals, expanding partnerships, and rising AI demand reinforce its leadership in connectivity solutions. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition remain a headwind. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\n\nAstera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

      "Content": "Though it may not feel like it amid recent concerns surrounding technology, particularly in software and some other stocks tied to the broader AI frenzy, many in the trade are still crushing it in the new year, delivering big-time gains.\n\nAnd concerning the all-star performers, three stocks that sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER reflect the top three hottest S&P 500 stocks in 2026. What’s been driving the positivity?\n\nSanDisk shares have been melting higher in 2026 months as its role in the broader AI frenzy finally comes into focus. The stock is up more than 160% in the new year alone, by far reflecting one of the strongest moves we’ve seen.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating SNDK’s performance in 2026 relative to the broader Zacks Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI is driving a huge surge in storage demand, which is where SanDisk comes in. NAND prices are rising rapidly, with AI data centers, cloud providers, and edge devices all needing more high-speed storage.\n\nThe company’s revenue acceleration is evident in recent quarterly releases, with sales of $3.0 billion climbing 61% year-over-year throughout its latest period. Its current fiscal year (ends in June) has also confirmed the favorable demand backdrop, with the current $14.1 billion estimate up a staggering 50% over the last year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWDC shares impressively reflected one of 2025’s top-performing S&P 500 stocks as well, with the fresh year already looking bright again. Western Digital provides scalable, sustainable technology for hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers, providing cutting-edge innovation that’s expected to drive the next generation of AI-driven data workloads.\n\nUp nearly 70%, the stock has been red-hot in the fresh year, underpinned by favorable quarterly results that have revealed a massive opportunity for the company.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s cash-generating abilities have seen a nice boost thanks to the environment, with free cash flow of $653 million throughout its latest period up by a triple-digit 125%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s critical to note that Western Digital also holds roughly a 20% stake in SNDK.\n\nTeradyne manufactures equipment used by other companies to test chips. Unsurprisingly, the fastest-growing segment here is chips for AI data centers and accelerators, and more complex chips mean greater test demand, with AI chips among the most complex right now.\n\nUp 60%, the stock has enjoyed a great year so far, particularly so relative to the Zacks Technology sector, which is essentially flat YTD.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTeradyne’s sales growth has been incredible over recent periods, as shown below. Recent quarterly results came in above the high-end of previous guidance, further explaining the positivity behind shares in the new year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile pockets of the broader Technology sector, particularly software, continue to get hammered in 2026, all three above – SanDisk SNDK, Western Digital WDC, and Teradyne TER – haven’t seen hardly any negativity, with all three benefiting in a huge way either directly or indirectly from the AI demand environment.\n\nNotably, all three stocks sport the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "ASML Holding ASML shares have surged 11.3% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 3.4%. ASML stock has also outperformed its peers, namely Lam Research LRCX and KLA Corporation KLAC, while underperforming Applied Materials AMAT in the same time frame.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of Lam Research, KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have returned 10.8%, 1.1% and 19.1%, respectively. This surge in stock price has also made ASML stock overvalued. ASML stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 12.66X compared with the sector average of 6.37X, which makes it overvalued at present, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of F.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow the question remains: Should the investors buy, sell or hold shares of this semiconductor manufacturing equipment player?\n\nSustained demand for artificial intelligence and high performance computing chips by global data centers, AI labs and hyperscalers has reinforced ASML’s long-term growth outlook as the company provides extreme ultraviolet (EUV) semiconductor lithography tools to chip manufacturers that enable them to accelerate capacity expansion.\n\nASML’s management on the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call noted that ASML’s customers have become more confident about medium-term AI demand, leading to stronger order intake and investment plans as chipmakers transition from 4-nanometer to 3-nanometer and prepare for the 2-nanometer transition.\n\nAs EUV intensity per wafer continues to rise, AI and HPC workloads are addressed more efficiently. In memory, robust demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced DRAM nodes is expected to tighten supply through at least 2026, further supporting EUV demand.\n\nASML is also benefiting from a growing installed base, which is driving high-margin service and upgrade revenues as customers increasingly view upgrades as the fastest way to add capacity. With a €38.8 billion backlog and reaffirmed long-term targets, ASML remains well-positioned to capitalize on the AI-led semiconductor investment cycle.\n\nFor 2026, ASML expects its revenues in the range of €34-€39 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 revenues is pegged at $43.31 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 17%.\n\nAlthough ASML faces competitive pressure from players like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA Corporation in the broader wafer equipment manufacturing market, ASML holds a near-monopoly in EUV technology.\n\nEUV is crucial for the world’s most advanced chips at 3nm and below; it benefits from extraordinary pricing power and strategic importance with major customers like TSMC, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML’s venture into sub-2nm production with High Numerical Aperture (High-NA) EUV systems is the next technological leap for chipmakers. This technology will provide ASML with long-term potential as the industry moves toward denser and more efficient chips. ASML’s High-NA machines will be central to that shift.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2026 earnings is pegged at $33.63, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20.3%. The consensus estimate has been revised upward in the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML’s unmatched EUV leadership, AI-driven demand visibility, and strong earnings momentum support a long-term bullish view, making this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock attractive at present.

      "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending is poised to jump significantly in 2026, with a recent report from CNBC suggesting that the capital expenditures (capex) of the top four hyperscalers in the U.S. could soar to $700 billion this year. That would be a big jump over 2025's capex of $394 billion.\n\nSemiconductor companies are likely to win big from this massive outlay , as they provide the basic building blocks that enable AI training and inference. Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) is among the semiconductor companies playing a central role in the proliferation of AI.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nShares of this company that sells optical and photonic networking components enabling high-speed transmission in AI data centers are already trading up 56% in 2026. It won't be surprising to see this stock delivering more gains this year, potentially becoming the best-performing AI chip stock of 2026.\n\nLet's see why that may be the case.\n\nLumentum released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the period ended Dec. 27, 2025) on Feb. 3. The company reported a 66% year-over-year increase in revenue to $666 million, well ahead of the $652 million Wall Street estimate. Even better, the company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped nearly 4x year over year to $1.67 per share, crushing the $1.41-per-share consensus expectation.\n\nCEO Michael Hurlston remarked on the latest earnings call that Lumentum is playing a critical role in AI data centers:\n\nImportantly, Lumentum expects to grow at a faster pace going forward, driven by its solid backlog, new contracts, and capacity expansion plans. The company has a backlog of more than $400 million for its optical circuit switches that enable high-speed transmission in data centers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company received what it calls an incremental \"multi-hundred-million-dollar\" contract in co-packaged optics, which are deployed in custom AI processors for their higher bandwidth and energy efficiency.\n\nLumentum has been aggressively expanding capacity to meet the terrific end-market demand. It already achieved more than half of the targeted 40% capacity improvement in the previous quarter. Moreover, Lumentum plans to bring new capacity online at two of its plants in the U.K. and Japan later this year.\n\nLumentum management anticipates an 85% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter to $805 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. Its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.25 per share is almost 4x the earnings it clocked in the same period last year.\n\nAnalysts expect a 263% spike in Lumentum's earnings in the current fiscal year to $7.47 per share, followed by impressive jumps over the next couple of years as well.\n\nThe company may deliver stronger growth as it brings more capacity online. That could pave the way for more upside in this technology stock, which is why investors can consider buying Lumentum before it jumps higher.",

And despite its recent highs, the stock is still not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analyst estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending June 2026) and just over 7.5 times fiscal 2027 estimates.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nThe company is a leading producer of NAND storage devices, or flash memory. It is one of the few pure-play ways to invest in this segment of the tech market after the company was spun off from Western Digital about a year ago. NAND has been a very cyclical market over the years, but the space looks like it is at the beginning of what appears to be a long-lasting supercycle.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that the NAND market was in complete disarray. After seeing huge demand for electronics stemming from the pandemic, memory makers overbuilt production, causing a huge oversupply in the market that led prices to crash. Things became so bad that NAND gross margins turned negative.\n\nThis disarray led many memory makers to hugely cut NAND production and redirect their focus to DRAM (dynamic random access memory). At the same time, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a specialized form of DRAM, began to take off because of its importance in helping optimize the performance of graphics processing units when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. HBM comes with strong unit economics, but it needs huge wafer capacity, so it began eating up memory maker resources.\n\nSoon after, AI data centers also started to need huge, high-performance solid-state drives (SSDs) that use NAND to help store training data. With production slashed and demand now suddenly surging, flash memory prices have been skyrocketing because there is now a huge NAND shortage. Given the economics and demand for HBM, along with growing demand for NAND, these market dynamics are unlikely to shift anytime in the near future.\n\nWith flash memory in short supply, Sandisk continues to benefit from increased prices, which are also dramatically lifting its gross margins and profits. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 61%, while its gross margins expanded from 32.3% a year ago to 50.9%, leading its adjusted earnings per share to surge fivefold.\n\nWith the NAND market going from a cyclical business to a structural growth story on the back of AI data centers, Sandisk finds itself in an enviable position. And with the boom in AI infrastructure spending, the company is set to see huge growth ahead. This makes the recent dip a buying opportunity.",

Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $2.21 billion, showing a 21.4% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $2.84 per share and a revenue of $8.18 billion, signifying shifts of +80.89% and +41.91%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marvell Technology.

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-monolithic-power-mpwr-strong-170004817.html",
      "Content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Monolithic Power (MPWR) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monolithic Power currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPWR that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor MPWR, shares are up 9.4% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 7.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.67% compares favorably with the industry's 11.65% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Monolithic Power have increased 35.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 71.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.65% and 15.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of MPWR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now MPWR is averaging 710,006 shares for the last 20 days..\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPWR.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPWR's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.91 to $21.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPWR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Monolithic Power on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The pace of artificial intelligence infrastructure investment is showing no signs of slowing, and investors are increasingly looking to companies outside the chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and into the companies enabling next-generation networking. One such company, which is seeing renewed interest, is Lumentum Holdings (LITE), as GF Securities highlighted it as one of the key beneficiaries of Nvidia’s co-packaged optics push.\n\nNvidia used this year’s GTC 2025 conference to launch its Quantum-X and Spectrum-X scale-out switch, which will likely be the precursor to further adoption of optical interconnection technology. This, in turn, should see the next-generation 115.2T CPO switch arrive in 2026, with supply chain acceleration through 2027, which should be a boon to optical component companies such as Lumentum.\n\nStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin as Crypto, MSTR Stock Prices Plunge.

The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nLumentum Holdings is an optical and photonic products company based in San Jose, California, that provides products to the cloud, networking, and industrial sectors. The company, which has a market capitalization of around $40.1 billion and an enterprise value of $42.1 billion, has clearly established itself as a “mission critical” supplier to the buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe stock has seen an explosive move over the last year, trading at $556, with a 52-week range of $45.65-$599.50. The stock has seen an increase of over 600% in weighted alpha, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Relative strength is sitting at 74.39, which highlights the stock’s strong performance.\n\nThe stock’s valuation has clearly expanded with the move, and investors seem willing to pay the premium to own this stock as it relates to next-generation artificial intelligence networking infrastructure growth. The stock has seen over 94% of institutional ownership, with a short float of 15.8%.\n\nThe company does not pay a dividend, as it is choosing to reinvest the money into further capacity expansion and next-generation product development.\n\nLumentum’s fiscal second quarter 2026 results were a significant turning point for the company. Revenue was $665.5 million, up considerably from $402.2 million in the year-ago period. Moreover, Lumentum’s GAAP diluted EPS was $0.89, whereas its non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.67, compared with $0.42 in the year-ago period. Lumentum’s margins also improved considerably. GAAP gross margin was 36.1%, while its non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up considerably from the year-ago period.\n\nWhat is more surprising is the fact that Lumentum’s non-GAAP operating margin was 25.2%, an increase of more than 1,700 points from the year-ago period. It appears the company is entering a new era of high volume and high value related to AI optical demand. Lumentum has identified two significant opportunities in the market, which are optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\n\nLumentum’s backlog for OCS is more than $400 million, whereas the company has announced a multi-hundred-million-dollar CPO order, which is due for the first half of calendar year 2027. Moreover, GF Securities has announced that Nvidia’s supply chain is expected to start ramping up in the second quarter of 2026, with acceleration in the second half of 2026 and into 2027.\n\nAnalysts hold positive expectations towards the stock with a “Strong Buy” rating consensus for LITE; however, the current price targets don't quite factor in the stock’s recent run-up. The stock’s current mean target price is $525.11, which it has already surpassed, and it has a high price target of $600 and a low price target of $420.\n\nConsidering the stock’s recent price of around $556, the stock’s mean price target of $525.11 translates into a potential downside of around 5.6%. However, the stock’s street-high price target of $600 implies a potential upside of around 7.9% if AI networking demand continues to surprise on the upside.",

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMarvell is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +80.9%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.51 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Marvell is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marvell.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Marvell, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.18 billion and $10.04 billion estimates indicate +41.9% and +22.7% changes, respectively.\n\nMarvell reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Marvell surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMarvell is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marvell. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Monolithic Power (MPWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Monolithic Power's main business drivers.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, based in Kirkland, WA, designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. The company focuses on the market for high-performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs).\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s products are widely used in industrial applications, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud computing, and automotive and consumer applications.\n\nBeing a fabless company, Monolithic works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the designing and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost.\n\nUnlike other fabless semiconductor companies, Monolithic installs its own proprietary process technologies in third-party contractors&rsquo; equipment and facilities.\n\nMonolithic reported total revenues of $751.15 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company&rsquo;s key product families are direct current to direct current (DC to DC) products and Lighting Control products.\n\nDC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and monitors, automobiles and medical equipment.\n\nLighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\n\nBy end market, 21.5% of total revenues came from Storage and Computing in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nEnterprise Data, Consumer, Industrial, Automotive and Communications end-markets contributed 31%, 8.8%, 7.2%, 20.1% and 11.14%, respectively, to the fourth quarter of 2025 revenues.\n\nMonolithic&rsquo;s primary competitors are Skyworks Solutions, Microchip Technology, Lattice Semiconductor, IPG Photonics, Power Integrations, Cree, Semtech, Micron Technology, Analog Devices, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES.\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Monolithic Power, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in February 2016 would be worth $21,271.42, or a 2,027.14% gain, as of February 12, 2026, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 279.51% and the price of gold increased 292.77% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPWR.\n\nMonolithic reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results, with both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has a strong growth opportunity due to its robust product portfolio that targets In-Car connectivity and infotainment, advanced driver assistance system and rapid adoption of LED lightings in cars and vehicles. Being a fabless company, MPWR works with third-party contractors and chip assemblers for the manufacturing, assembling and testing of wafers and ICs. This approach permits the company to focus more on the design and development of process technology at a lower fixed cost. However, MPWR faces challenges due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and short product life-cycles are other challenges.\n\nThe stock is up 21.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2026. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.",

      "Content": "Lumentum ( LITE ) delivered a stellar beat-and-raise December quarter last week that has estimates soaring.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings of $1.67 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.68%, and were up nearly 300% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNon-GAAP revenues of $665.5 million, which beat the consensus mark by 1.85%, increased 24.7% on a sequential basis and 65.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe growth showcases the strength of the company&rsquo;s plans for both optical components and systems in a world where NVIDIA ( NVDA ) is building next-gen GPU rack-scale datacenter architectures based on silicon photonics connectivity, switching, and networking.\n\nProduct-wise, revenues from the Components segment contributed 66.7% to total revenues in the fiscal second quarter. The figure increased 68.3% year over year to $443.7 million. System revenues contributed 33.3% to total revenues. The figure increased 60.1% year over year to $221.8 million.\n\nLITE Q3 2026 Guidance Ignites Estimates\n\nFor Q3 fiscal 2026 (ends March), LITE expects non-GAAP revenues between $780 and $830 million vs a prior consensus closer to $700 million. The company expects non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, vs expectations of 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings between $2.15 and $2.35 per share, vs a prior consensus under $1.60.\n\nAnd if any investor or analyst was wondering if this blistering pace was going to slow down any time soon, management said this during the conference call...\n\n&ldquo;Our forward guidance calls for over 85% year-over-year revenue growth, yet we are only at the starting line for two substantial opportunities: optical circuit switches (OCS) and co-packaged optics (CPO).\"\n\nAnd analysts are already reflecting this optimism in Q4 FY'26 (ends June) with projected growth of 87.5% to $900 million.\n\nThe full-year 2026 sales consensus moved to $2.9 billion, representing over 76% annual growth. And FY'27 is already projected to come in near $4.7 billion, for a 61.5% advance.\n\nAs you would expect, these sales ramps, combined with improving margins, are driving the bottom line estimates higher for both this year and next.\n\nA month ago, the FY26 EPS consensus was at $5.67 and FY27 at $8.29. Today they stand at $7.63 and $14.11, representing growth of 270% and 85%, respectively.\n\nHow NVIDIA Ignited Demand for Optical Interconnect\n\nI'll admit: I was late to the optical party. And I should not have been since I follow NVIDIA so closely. Lessons learned. In December, I profiled Lumentum optical peer Coherent ( COHR ). Here's what I wrote...\n\nWe know NVIDIA is a big customer of Credo Technology ( CRDO ) AECs because CEO Jensen Huang is a big fan of copper for connecting GPUs within rack-scale architectures and Credo has repeatedly showcased its AECs in live demonstrations at the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference (GTC). These demos feature Credo's AECs connecting servers and switches directly to NVIDIA H100 GPUs to create disaggregated, rack-scale GPU clusters.\n\nBut at GTC in March [2025], Jensen announced a collaboration with a purely optical player, Coherent.\n\nOne big driver of investor enthusiasm that helped drive COHR shares from below $70 to over $190 this year was their collaboration with NVIDIA announced at GTC in March.\n\nCoherent and NVIDIA will develop silicon photonics networking switches using co-packaged optics (CPO). This ecosystem will allow AI factories to connect millions of GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA still uses copper wiring within Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale systems to connect GPUs to each other, but to \"scale out\" across the datacenter Jensen Huang recognized the power and speed of optical solutions to connect many racks together for the lowest latency.\n\nThus NVIDIA has several connectivity and networking systems that use optical and photonics solutions and they can be categorized into two main areas: Interconnect Products, including Infiniband and Ethernet protocols, and the upcoming Co-Packaged Optics, like Spectrum-X Photonics Switches.\n\nLITE and TSMC: Co-Design for the Win\n\nLumentum and Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ), aka TSMC, aka THE advanced chip foundry, are two of the most critical \"ingredient\" partners in NVIDIA's move toward Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).\n\nTheir collaboration solves a massive physics problem: as AI clusters grow to millions of GPUs, traditional copper wiring and pluggable transceivers consume too much power and generate too much heat.\n\nBy moving optics into the chip package, they reduce power consumption by roughly 3.5x and increase signal integrity significantly. Here is how they work together to build this for NVIDIA's next-gen platforms like Quantum-X and Spectrum-X.\n\nBut TSMC has to provide the \"packaging\" that allows electricity and light to live on the same chip. A major challenge with CPO is that lasers are heat-sensitive. If you put a laser directly next to a hot GPU or Switch ASIC, it will fail.\n\nTSMC&rsquo;s Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) is a 3D packaging process. It allows NVIDIA to stack the Electrical IC (the brain) directly on top of the Photonic IC (the eyes).\n\nMe and the Analysts: Won't Get Fooled Again\n\nAfter I understood this integrated circuit of interdependency, I finally bought Lumentum shares in January at $350 on the pullback from $400. Most analysts were still too timid with estimates and the high price targets were only calling for $450. Heck, Morgan Stanley thought $350 was fair!\n\nAfter earnings, LITE could only manage to kiss $500 and retreat. So I sold some of my position at $485, thinking it may have gone too far, too fast.\n\nIn retrospect, I was foolish to ever doubt the risk appetite for Lumentum (LITE) based solely on the weak reception for its stellar report that day.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious as soon as the next day when everything was falling out of bed on Feb 5 because LITE tested the silly post-earnings low at $426 and reversed higher with a big fat engulfing candle to close above $500!\n\nThen Friday, as the upgrades and delayed reactions poured in, she gaps up to $540 and closes above $550.\n\nThey almost got me again with two kisses of $600 on Monday and Wednesday this week, and then another about-face. But I'm not falling for it this time.\n\nI'm holding my shares for the full realization of what NVIDIA (NVDA) is building for the next five years, where optical components are required at multiple stages and optical providers like LITE and Coherent (COHR) can be involved at different stages of design and fabrication with CPO.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the Street herd gathering around $550 with their PTs...\n\nRosenblatt $580\nJP Morgan $565\nCiti $560\nNeedam $550\nSusquehanna $550\nB. Riley $526\nMizuho $525\nBofA $520\nStifel $480\nBarclays $475 (Equal-Weight)\nUBS $455 (from $215! and stays at Neutral)\n\nSee ya next quarter when Lumentum surprises again and they raise their PTs to $650.\n\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, TSM, CRDO, and LITE shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nKevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks where he runs the TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "We recently published 10 Stocks Delivering Massive Returns . Entegris Inc. (NASDAQ:ENTG) was one of the best performers on Tuesday.\n\nEntegris jumped to a new 52-week high on Tuesday, as investors cheered its upbeat outlook for the first quarter of the year, despite reporting a dismal earnings performance last quarter.\n\nAt intra-day trading, Entegris Inc. (NASDAQ:ENTG) soared to its highest price of $137.05 before paring gains to finish the session just up by 9.03 percent at $133.44 apiece.\n\nIn a statement, the company announced targets of growing its net income by 3.3 percent to 22 percent, to $65 million to $77 million from $62.9 million in the same period last year.\n\nNet sales are targeted at $785 million to $825 million, or an implied growth of 1.5 percent to 6.7 percent from the $773.2 million reported in the same period a year earlier.\n\nLast year, Entegris Inc.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsem-tower-revises-model-higher-161800468.html",
      "Content": "By Lisa Thompson\n\nNASDAQ:TSEM\n\nREAD THE FULL TSEM RESEARCH REPORT\n\nAs demand exceeds capacity, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) has decided to accelerate its investment as it sees margins continue to expand from the sale of new products. It is adding another $270 in capex to the next two years of spending to expand capacity for RF infrastructure products as demand outstrips supply. While the company is limited as to how high it can raise prices, it is deemphasizing lower margin products as it ramps new high margin ones. High margin SiPh contributed $228 million in 2025, up from $106 million in revenues in 2024, and with this additional investment, the company plans to grow capacity to greater than 5x of the actual Q4 monthly silicon photonics wafer shipments, compared to the 3x target given during the Q3 call. Over 70% of the total SiPho capacity is either presently reserved or in the process of being reserved through 2028, backed with customer prepayment.\n\nFor Q1 2026, Tower guided to revenues of $412 million plus or minus 5%, which results in slightly accelerating year-over-year growth.\n\nAs of last night’s closing price, the company trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.3 EV to estimated sales for 2027. Since its low at $28.54 on April 4, 2025, the stock has rocketed 379%. TSEM trades at an enterprise value of $14.3 billion, or 6.5 EV to estimated sales for 2027, higher than its peers, who trade at an average of 5.7x. However, if we look at the components of that average, we see they diverge, with SMIC and Taiwan Semiconductor averaging 8.4x, while slower-growing Global Foundries and United Microelectronics are at or under 3.0x. At 8.4xs, TSEM stock would be worth approximately $175 per share using 2027 revenues. To be conservative, we are raising our price target to $150 as TSEM works to reach those revenue numbers.\n\nQ4 2025 Results\n\nThe biggest revenue contribution in the quarter again came from RF infrastructure, surpassing RF Mobile. In Q4, RF Infrastructure grew 102% to $141 million, up from $107 million in Q3 2025, and showed growth of 81.3% for the year. SiPh was $95 million of that (including some NREs) for the quarter and grew 70%. For the year, SiPh contributed $228 million compared to $106 million the year before. The growth rates are accelerating as well as the percent contribution to total sales. As they become a bigger portion of total revenues, growth should continue to accelerate.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mrvl-declines-8-3-months-154800725.html",
      "Content": "Marvell Technology MRVL shares have lost 8.2% in the past three months, underperforming its Computer and Technology sector, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry and peers like Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Micron Technology MU.\n\nShares of Broadcom and NVIDIA have lost 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively, while Micron Technology shares have surged 52.4%. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry appreciated 2.7% in the same time frame compared with no change for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven this decline in a month, the question arises: Should investors buy, sell or hold the stock at present? Let’s dive deeper into the fundamentals and financials of the MRVL stock to answer this question.\n\nMarvell Technology’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 signals softer near-term growth. The company guided revenues of $2.2 billion (+/- 5%), representing just 21% year-over-year growth, a slowdown compared to recent quarters. The top line has been in a declining trend for the past three quarters.\n\nDespite strong demand for electro-optics, management expects data center revenues to grow 20% year over year in the fourth quarter, suggesting a decelerating growth rate in the past six quarters. One of the major reasons for this decelerating growth is the growing presence of players like Broadcom and Astera Labs in the AI connectivity space.\n\nBroadcom is strong in networking, data center, broadband, Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHYs and switches. In the communications segment, Broadcom mainly provides high-speed connectivity, optical or wireline networking equipment, cable or broadband IC portfolio, PCIe switch and retimer.\n\nMarvell Technology’s rapid expansion of its portfolio has helped it keep pace with the market trend. MRVL is developing a co-packaged copper system with a 2.5m direct attach cable and a Co-packaged optics switch system. The volume shipments of MRVL’s next-generation 200G per lane 1.6T PAM DSPs are also a tailwind.\n\nThe company recently launched the Golden Cable initiative to accelerate and expand the Active Electrical Cable ecosystem for faster deployment of AI infrastructure by cloud and hyperscaler customers. MRVL is also gaining from the adoption of scale-up switches that connect AI accelerators within and across racks, requiring multi-terabit bandwidth and ultra-low latency.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI workload and allied infrastructure has attracted multiple players in this space. Semiconductor giants, including Micron Technology and NVIDIA, are in the AI processing, networking and memory space. Besides semiconductor partners, MRVL has collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nMicron Technology has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth. MRVL has collaborated with MU on HBM design and integration for AI compute platforms to provide a custom HBM compute architecture.\n\nThe growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Marvell Technology has partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution.\n\nTogether with its deep expertise in the AI semiconductor space and strong partner base, the company is able to keep its operating costs low and grow its top line at the same time, hence benefiting from a high growth rate in the bottom line. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, non-GAAP operating expenses grew just 4% year over year, even as revenues climbed 37% year over year, showcasing disciplined cost management.\n\nThe consensus estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 81%. The estimate has remained unchanged for the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMRVL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/S) ratio of 6.87, well below the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry average of 8.4, indicating that the stock appears undervalued at current levels.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough MRVL’s top line is showing a declining growth rate, the company has been able to retain its earnings growth through prudent cost measures. Marvell Technology has strong long-term fundamentals supported by its strong foothold in the data center, deep AI portfolio and high-speed networking space. Considering these factors, we suggest investors retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock at present.

      "Content": "Chicago, IL &ndash; February 11, 2026 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Skyworks SWKS and RF Industries RFIL.\n\nIndustry: Electronics - Radio Frequency\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2847030/2-radio-frequency-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry participants like Skyworks and RF Industries are benefiting from the continued adoption of WiFi 7, as well as the rapid proliferation of the edge IoT, AI data centers and automotive electrification. The growing need for faster connections, low latency, and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots.\n\nThe democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry participants. Nevertheless, industry players are facing a challenging demand environment that has resulted in inventory buildup. Sluggish capital spending by telecom carriers has been a headwind. Industry participants are suffering from heightened global macroeconomic uncertainties. Weakness in end-markets like automotive, industrial and infrastructure has been concerning.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in the congested RF spectrum.\n\nThey serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF Industry\n\nAccelerated 5G Deployment Acts as a Tailwind : The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which is expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. The growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects.\n\nInnovation Opens up Business Avenues : The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense.\n\nThe diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. The evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. The rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. Industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.\n\nGrowing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospects : Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #20, which places it in the top 8% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2026 have moved up by 7.4% since June 30, 2025.\n\nGiven the bright prospect, there are a few stocks worth watching in the industry. However, before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry has underperformed the S&P 500 and its broader sector over the past year. The industry has declined 9.6% over this period against the S&P 500&rsquo;s return of 16.8% and the broader sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 21.8%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing the Semiconductors - Radio Frequency stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.51X, lower than the S&P 500&rsquo;s 22.98X and the sector&rsquo;s 25.91X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.71X and as low as 7.89X, the median being 14.65X.\n\n2 Radio Frequency Stocks to Watch\n\nRF Industries : Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have moved up 111.8% in the past year.

RFIL&rsquo;s prospects ride on diversifying portfolio, customers and end markets, as well as an expanding partner base.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RFIL&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 earnings has increased 8 cents to 43 cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nSkyworks : This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from positive momentum in demand signals and backlog improvement, especially in automotive electrification, edge IoT, and AI data centers. The growing adoption of Wi-Fi 7 and upcoming Wi-Fi 8 systems drives growth. Strong demand for RF content in real-time video, sensors and software-defined vehicles provides a boost to SWKS&rsquo; prospects.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues between $875 million and $925 million. SWKS expects a roughly 20% decline in Mobile, while Broad markets are expected to remain flat sequentially but grow high single digits year over year.\n\nSkyworks shares have dropped 4.8% in the past year.

A : David Reeder, CEO, explained that the industry backdrop for 2026 appears more constructive than in 2025. Entegris expects to benefit from node transitions in both logic and memory, which typically drive additional content per wafer. While CapEx was not favorable in 2025, it is expected to be more constructive in 2026, particularly in fab CapEx. The company is cautiously optimistic about achieving outperformance, contingent on the timing of node transitions and CapEx developments.\n\nQ : How should we think about the margin trajectory for 2026, given the guidance for Q1? A : Linda Lagorga, CFO, noted that gross margin has stabilized and is expected to improve with increased production volumes. The ramping of the Taiwan facility and rationalization of existing facilities are expected to contribute to margin improvement. The company is focused on volume leverage to drive margins, which will positively impact EBITDA.\n\nQ : What is the outlook for MSI (wafer starts) and CapEx for 2026? A : David Reeder, CEO, stated that MSI is expected to grow in the mid-single digits for 2026. CapEx is anticipated to be up modestly, with strong growth in WFE (wafer fab equipment) and a potential increase in fab construction CapEx in the second half of the year. The company is monitoring these factors closely as they impact revenue growth.\n\nQ : Can you provide an update on the competitive landscape in China and how Entegris is addressing it? A : David Reeder, CEO, emphasized that the fundamentals in China are similar to the rest of the world, focusing on yield and performance. Entegris is working to assure supply to Chinese customers by qualifying more manufacturing overseas, particularly in Asia. The company expects to supply approximately 85% of China revenue from regional facilities in Q1, with plans to increase this proportion through 2026.\n\nQ : How is Entegris positioned to benefit from the growth in AI and advanced packaging markets? A : David Reeder, CEO, highlighted that about 60% of Entegris' revenue comes from advanced nodes, with AI being a significant growth driver. The company is focusing on advanced packaging, which grew nicely in 2025 and is expected to continue growing in 2026. Entegris is making concerted efforts to expand its product lines in this area, anticipating more benefits in 2027 and beyond.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .",

      "Content": "Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) shares rose after the company -- which sells critical design architecture for making semiconductors -- saw artificial intelligence (AI) demand boost its revenue. The stock, however, has still lost about a third of its value over the past year and it faces a big potential risk next fiscal year. Let's see what that is -- and what investors should do.\n\nAfter an initial dip following its results, Arm shares rallied as investors turned their focus more toward its AI opportunities than worries about smartphones. Arm said it sees its data center business becoming its largest segment in the coming year, and that it will reach a 50% market share among top hyperscalers. This growth is being led by the shift toward inference and AI agents, which it says makes central processing units (CPUs) more important within the data center.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nHowever, the company did admit that increasing memory supply constraints could put a dent in smartphone sales, with talk of a potential 15% reduction in volumes over the next year. That said, it noted that even a 20% reduction would only equate to a 2% to 4% effect on its smartphone royalties. However, this company is trading at a growth multiple, so that is a big potential risk.\n\nOverall, Arm's fiscal third-quarter revenue jumped 26% year over year to $1.24 billion. License revenue rose by 25% year over year to $505 million. Its agreement with Softbank contributed $200 million to that total. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by two, to 50. Over half of its top 30 customers use this license. It also added six Arm Flexible Access customers, bringing the total to 318.\n\nRoyalty revenue, meanwhile, rose 27% year over year to $737 million. The growth was driven by increased adoption of newer ARM technology, including Armv9 architecture and Arm CSS (compute subsystems), which carry higher royalty rates. It said five customers are now shipping devices with CSS chips, including the top four Android phone makers.\n\nAnnualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, soared 28% to $1.62 billion. Looking ahead, Arm guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to come in around $1.47 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%. Royalty growth is projected to be up by the low teens and licensing by the high teens. It forecasts that adjusted earnings per share will be between $0.54 and 0.62.\n\nArm's licensing and royalty business model is attractive given its high gross margin and recurring nature, and the company has an opportunity to continue to grow nicely in the data center space. Meanwhile, its ties to Softbank provide a steady stream of growth.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 49 based on analysts' fiscal 2027 consensus, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.7 (with below 1 considered undervalued), ARM looks reasonably priced. However, the likely weakness in the smartphone market next year isn't necessarily embedded in those estimates, and as such, this would keep me on the sidelines for now.",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-radio-frequency-stocks-watch-153200221.html",
      "Content": "The Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry participants like Skyworks SWKS and RF Industries RFIL are benefiting from the continued adoption of WiFi 7, as well as the rapid proliferation of the edge IoT, AI data centers and automotive electrification. The growing need for faster connections, low latency, and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots. The democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry participants. Nevertheless, industry players are facing a challenging demand environment that has resulted in inventory buildup. Sluggish capital spending by telecom carriers has been a headwind. Industry participants are suffering from heightened global macroeconomic uncertainties. Weakness in end-markets like automotive, industrial and infrastructure has been concerning.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in the congested RF spectrum. They serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF Industry\n\nAccelerated 5G Deployment Acts as a Tailwind : The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which is expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvts-trades-premium-valuation-hold-151800624.html",
      "Content": "Navitas Semiconductor NVTS is currently trading at a high price-to-sales (P/S) multiple compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Navitas Semiconductor’s forward 12-month P/S ratio sits at 49.54X, significantly higher than the industry’s forward 12-month P/S ratio of 8.26X. The Zacks Value Score of F also suggests that NVTS stock is overvalued.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor stock trades at a higher P/S multiple compared with other industry peers, including Lam Research LRCX, Applied Materials AMAT and FormFactor FORM. At present, Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have P/S multiples of 11.58X, 8.46X and 7.69X, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s elevated valuation raises concerns about whether the stock can justify such lofty multiples. Considering the premium valuation, investors must be wondering whether they should buy, hold or sell the stock, especially amid near-term challenges.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor has decided to walk away from its low-margin mobile products to focus its resources on high-power business. This strategic decision is hurting the company’s top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2025, NVTS’s revenues decreased 53.4% year over year to $10.1 million, reflecting adverse impacts from its strategic decision to deprioritize its lower-margin China mobile business.\n\nThe company projects a further decline in its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2025. Navitas Semiconductor expects fourth-quarter 2025 revenues to be $7 million (+/- $0.25 million), down significantly on a sequential basis as the company is pruning its low-margin mobile business to align its resources toward high-power business.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s decision to prune its mobile business seems to have weighed on investors’ sentiments, as reflected by a decline in NVTS’ share price over the past three months. NVTS stock has plunged 11% over the past month, underperforming the industry’s decline of 2.7%.\n\nThe stock has underperformed its industry peers, including Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor. Shares of Lam Research, Applied Materials and FormFactor have returned 3.8%, 7.6% and 31%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, for investors, not everything is gloom and doom.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is shifting its focus toward high-power markets, such as AI data centers, performance computing, energy and grid infrastructure, and industrial electrification. This strategic move aligns with the company’s “Navitas 2.0” strategy, under which the company is reallocating resources toward high-power markets, pruning lower-margin mobile business, and working more closely with hyperscalers, graphics processing unit vendors and system OEMs.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor’s inclusion in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt AI factory ecosystem is an important step. The new architecture shifts data center power distribution from traditional AC/DC stages to a high-voltage DC approach that requires faster, more efficient power electronics. This creates an opening for Navitas Semiconductor’s gallium nitride (GaN) and high-voltage silicon carbide (SiC) technologies, both of which are now part of the NVIDIA-led ecosystem.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Navitas Semiconductor highlighted that it is one of the few companies offering both GaN and SiC solutions across the full power path from the grid to the graphics processing unit. The company has begun sampling mid-voltage GaN devices at 100 volts, which target the last stage of power conversion inside AI servers. It is also sampling 2.3 kV and 3.3 kV SiC modules for grid and energy storage applications that support these new data center designs.\n\nNVTS expects 2026 to be a transition year, with small but growing shipments tied to traditional server power supplies. The larger opportunity depends on how fast hyperscalers adopt the 800-volt architecture and will depend on Navitas Semiconductor's ability to secure multi-generation design wins.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is strengthening its position in high-power markets through strategic partnerships. In mid-December, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its distribution relationship with Avnet, making the latter a globally franchised distribution partner. Under the deal, Avnet will provide technical and commercial support for NVTS’ GaN and SiC products across regions.\n\nIn early December, NVTS entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Cyient Semiconductors to accelerate GaN adoption in India. The two companies plan to co-develop GaN products, system modules and design platforms aimed at high-voltage, high-power markets, such as AI data centers, electric mobility and grid infrastructure.\n\nIn late November, Navitas Semiconductor expanded its partnership with WT Microelectronics in Asia. NVTS is consolidating its distributor base, and WT Microelectronics will take the lead for customer engagement and logistics in Asia, per the partnership agreement. This collaboration is meant to improve support for high-power customers in the region.\n\nIn mid-November, Navitas Semiconductor announced a long-term partnership with GlobalFoundries. Under this collaboration, the two companies will develop and manufacture next-generation GaN power devices at Global Foundries’ Vermont facility, with development planned for early 2026 and production expected later that year.\n\nThese partnerships bode well for the company's prospects as Navitas Semiconductor is trying to prepare for future demand. Through these strategic partnerships, NVTS aims to strengthen its supply chain, improve customer access, and prepare for large future opportunities, once high-power markets begin to scale in 2026 and 2027.\n\nNVTS shares are trading above their 50-day & 200-day moving averages, a bullish technical signal that indicates the potential for continued upward momentum in the near term.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNavitas Semiconductor is in a good position to benefit from the fast growth of AI data centers and is making steady progress through its strategic partnerships, which bode well for the company’s prospects and support its long-term growth plans. The company’s GaN and high-voltage SiC products now play a role in NVIDIA’s new 800-volt power setup, which shows that the technology is relevant and in demand.\n\nHowever, Navitas Semiconductor’s premium valuation warrants a cautious approach to the stock.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-txn-reliance-international-141502723.html",
      "Content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Texas Instruments' (TXN) international operations for the quarter ending December 2025? Given the extensive global presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nWhile analyzing TXN's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.42 billion, showing rise of 10.4%. We will now explore the breakdown of TXN's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Japan contributed $290 million in revenue, making up 6.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $297.43 million, this meant a surprise of -2.5%. Looking back, Japan contributed $313 million, or 6.6%, in the previous quarter, and $277 million, or 6.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRest of World generated $98 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 2.2% of the total. This represented a surprise of +26.34% compared to the $77.57 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of World accounted for $74 million (1.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $69 million (1.7%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $948 million came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 21.4%. This represented a surprise of +3.13% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $919.21 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $972 million, or 20.5%, and $786 million, or 19.6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nRest of Asia accounted for 10.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $457 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.19%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $476.96 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Rest of Asia contributed $505 million (10.7%) and $432 million (10.8%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nChina generated $951 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.9% compared to the $933.3 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, China accounted for $1.02 billion (21.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $821 million (20.5%) to the total revenue.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments to report $4.51 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to contribute 6.5% (translating to $293.26 million), 1.7% ($77.37 million), 20.5% ($925.54 million), 10.5% ($473.62 million), and 20.7% ($933.44 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $19.36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 9.5% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Rest of World, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Rest of Asia and China are expected to make up 6.4%, 1.7%, 20%, 10.3%, and 20.5% of this total, corresponding to $1.24 billion, $322.14 million, $3.86 billion, $2 billion, and $3.97 billion, respectively.\n\nTexas Instruments' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\n\nTexas Instruments, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .\n\nOver the past month, the stock has gained 15.7% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, of which Texas Instruments is a part, has declined 1.1% over the same period. The company's shares have increased 41.2% over the past three months compared to the S&P 500's 3.7% increase. Over the same period, the sector has risen 2.3%\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.",

      "Content": "The S&P 500 is off to a fairly underwhelming start. As of Monday's close, it was up less than 2% since January. Many growth stocks have been struggling, while dividend stocks are suddenly becoming hot buys.\n\nTwo dividend stocks that are off to hot starts since the beginning of the year are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) . They have soared past the broad index, and here's why it might not be too late to invest in them.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nEntering trading on Tuesday, Lockheed Martin's stock was up 32% year to date. It's a fantastic performance after an unexciting year in 2025, when its share price was flat.\n\nThe company posted some strong earnings numbers at the end of January, reporting that its backlog was a record $194 billion. Its numbers came in better than its own expectations, and the business said it experienced \"unprecedented demand\" in the previous year. With strong government relationships and more growth expected for 2026, it's little wonder the defense stock has been a good buy early on.\n\nIts yield of 2.2% is also about twice what you'd get with the average S&P 500 stock right now. And at 21 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst projections), it's not an expensive stock to own, either. For long-term investors, Lockheed Martin can be a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nAnother stock that's been red hot to start 2026 is semiconductor company Texas Instruments. It's up just over 26% and it also recently released its earnings numbers. For the last three months of 2025, its revenue of $4.4 billion rose by 10% year over year, as demand from data centers has been strong and driving a lot of growth for the business.\n\nIts diversified semiconductor business features more than 80,000 parts that help companies in various industries, making it an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 is a bit high, but with some encouraging long-term growth prospects and its data center segment potentially being a catalyst for the foreseeable future, the stock can still be a suitable option for investors who are looking to buy and hold for years.\n\nTexas Instruments pays an above-average dividend that yields 2.6%, and it has been increasing its payout for 22 consecutive years. This is not only a promising growth investment, but also a terrific dividend stock to hang on to for the long haul.",

      "Content": "Wall Street offered a muted performance last week. The S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.8%. The key event of the week was the tech stock rout. Wall Street has been skeptical about software stocks in recent times, but a phase of outright panic hit last week.\n\nTraders dumped shares across the sector as fears mount that artificial intelligence (AI) could fundamentally disrupt software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models.The anxiety intensified on Feb. 3, 2026, after AI startup Anthropic unveiled a productivity tool aimed at in-house lawyers. The announcement triggered a sharp selloff in legal software and publishing stocks, per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\n\nMeanwhile, six out of all Mag 7 members have reported their Q4 results, with just NVDA remaining. Alphabet and Amazon reported last week.Amazon missed EPS estimates, but the business is otherwise in great shape.\n\nAmazon plans to spend $200 billion in capital expenditures in 2026, up from $132 billion in 2025 and $83 billion in 2024. While Amazon remains the cloud leader, the Alphabet report showed accelerating momentum at the search giant&rsquo;s Google Cloud business (read: Amazon Drops on Mixed Q4 & Capex Outlook: Buy the Dip With ETFs?).\n\nIn a nutshell, combining the actual results for the six Magnificent 7 members that have reported already along with estimates for Nvidia, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up 24.2% from the same period last year on 18.9% higher revenues, which would follow the group&rsquo;s 28.3% earnings growth on 18.1% revenue growth in 2025 Q3, per Zacks Earnings Trends.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight the winning leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nTradr 2X Long LITE Daily ETF LITX &ndash; Up 79.5%\n\nLumentum Holdings Inc LITE stock surged 36.3% last week on the earnings strength. Lumentum's Q1 2026 revenues rose 58% year over year to $533.8 million, topping estimates by 1.43%. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.10 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%, driven by AI and cloud strength. The company offered an upbeat outlook, too.\n\nTradr 2X Long ENPH Daily ETF ENPX &ndash; Up 67.7%\n\nEnphase Energy ENPH shares rose 35.8% last week. Enphase last weekreported fourth-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of 71 cents per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents by 31.5%.Enphase Energy&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues of $343.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $335 million by 2.6%.\n\nTradr 2X Short IREN Daily ETF IREZ &ndash; Up 37.1%\n\nIREN Ltd IREN lost about 20.1% last week, lending a surge to the double-leveraged IREN ETF. Last week, IREN came with a Q2 FY26 loss of 44 cents per share as revenues slid 23.1% sequentially and missed estimates. Total revenues fell 23.1% sequentially to $184.7 million, missing the consensus estimate by 16.49%. Bitcoin revenues fell 28.2% quarter on quarter. However, AI cloud services revenues jumped 137% from the prior quarter.\n\nT-Rex 2X Long ARM Daily Target ETF ARMU) &ndash; Up 35.0%\n\nArm Holdings ARM gained about 18% last week. The stock gained on a strong fiscal third-quarter 2026 earnings report released on Feb. 4, 2026. The stock gained as investors focused on strong growth in AI and data center segments.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "When investors look at investing in computer chips to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they are likely to start with a company like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . That makes sense, given that it makes the most popular chips for handling AI workloads. However, there's another chip stock that could also turn out to be a huge AI winner: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) .\n\nNvidia makes high-powered parallel processing chips that act as the primary brains that undergird AI software. Texas Instruments makes analog chips, the boring ones that convert physical events into digital signals. When you push a button on a digital device, it is likely being controlled by an analog chip. Texas Instruments' chips are simple, relatively low cost, and can be found in tech products virtually everywhere.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\n\nIn the artificial intelligence hardware world, Texas Instruments' chips provide power management. That's a vital function within the data centers that house AI. Given the expectation that the AI infrastructure buildout is only just beginning, Texas Instruments could have years of growth ahead of it in this end market.\n\nOver the last few years, the analog chip sector has been in a rut. However, Texas Instruments has been investing in new chip production capacity. Just recently, it agreed to buy competitor Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) . In other words, Texas Instruments is preparing for growth.\n\nIt is also shifting the way it reports its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company broke out its data center business as a separate end market. The segment accounted for around 9% of the top line. However, it grew 64% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's probably not a number to bake into your growth expectations, given that the AI opportunity is brand new. Still, revenue rose by a mid-single-digit percentage from the third quarter. If this is just the beginning of the AI buildout, this segment could help supercharge an upturn in the typically cyclical analog chip sector and support growth for years to come.\n\nThere are other analog chipmakers , and there are chipmakers that make more exciting chips than Texas Instruments. However, for most investors, opening a position in this industry-leading company will probably set you up for long-term success. And given the strength of the business and the company's growth efforts, the AI buildout could easily turn Texas Instruments into a top-performing chipmaker by 2027, if not sooner.",

The State Street SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) surged 45.3% over the same 52-week period and added 11.6% YTD.\n\nOn Feb. 2, NXP Semiconductors reported its Q4 2025 earnings results, immediately lifting the stock 2.2%. Revenue grew 7.2% year over year to $3.34 billion, topping the $3.3 billion analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS rose 5.3% to $3.35, clearing Wall Street’s $3.30 forecast with room to spare.\n\nDespite beating headline estimates, NXPI stock slid 4.5% in the next trading session as investors focused on elevated inventories and emerging signs of long-term margin pressure. However, management countered with a strategic reset anchored in “physical artificial intelligence (AI),” emphasizing accelerating demand for industrial products with built-in intelligence at the edge.\n\nLeadership also cited stronger regional manufacturing amid geopolitical pressure. As automakers stop trimming orders and inventory correction fades, management now sees visibility into growth from next-generation, AI-enabled products.\n\nThe outlook carries into the forward estimates. For fiscal year 2026, ending in December, analysts project diluted EPS of $12.37, implying 21.3% year-over-year growth. Importantly, NXP Semiconductors has beaten EPS expectations in three of the past four quarters, missing only once.\n\nWall Street sentiment remains firmly supportive, assigning NXPI stock an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Out of 30 analysts, 22 rate NXPI stock a “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” and six suggest “Hold.”\n\nImportantly, the outlook remains unchanged from three months ago, when 22 analysts also labeled the stock a “Strong Buy.”\n\nWhile NXPI stock has lagged peers from a growth standpoint, recent demand commentary appears stronger than that of many competitors. Reinforcing this view, TD Cowen raised its price target to $285 from $260 on Jan. 16 while maintaining a “Buy” rating on the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, analyst targets paint a clearer picture of what the market believes the stock can deliver. NXPI’s average price target of $259.67 implies potential upside of 15.8%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $324.40 suggests a gain of 44.6% from current levels.",
